### 1. Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in selecting the best management strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines and
their recommendations should facilitate decision making of health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning
an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other societies and organisations. Because of the impact on clinical practice,
quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The
recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can
[be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)

[Writing-ESC-Guidelines). ESC Guidelines represent the official posi-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
tion of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.

Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including
representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in
order to represent professionals involved with the medical care of
patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of a given condition according to ESC Committee for
Practice Guidelines (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assess
ment of the risk–benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the

3170 ESC Guidelines


strength of the recommendation of particular management
options were weighed and graded according to predefined scales,

as outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. These
forms were compiled into one file and can be found on the ESC
[website (http://www.escardio.org/guidelines). Any changes in dec-](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
larations of interest that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire
financial support from the ESC without any involvement from the
healthcare industry.

The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of
new Guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the
endorsement process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines
undergo extensive review by the CPG and external experts. After
appropriate revisions the Guidelines are approved by all the
experts involved in the Task Force. The finalized document is
approved by the CPG for publication in the European Heart
Journal. The Guidelines were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence
available at the time of their dating.

. [....................................................................]


The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation
of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary
slides, booklets with essential messages, summary cards for nonspecialists and an electronic version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus, if needed, one
should always refer to the full text version, which is freely available
via the ESC website and hosted on the EHJ website. The National
Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, translate and implement all ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed
because it has been shown that the outcome of disease may be
favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical

recommendations.

Surveys and registries are needed to verify that real-life daily
practice is in keeping with what is recommended in the guidelines,
thus completing the loop between clinical research, writing of
guidelines, disseminating them and implementing them into clinical

practice.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in
the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic
or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines do

sion of the data that have provided the basis for the recommendations can be found in the relevant book chapter.

2.3 Why these Guidelines are important
Pregnancy is complicated by maternal disease in 1–4% of cases. New
data about the prevalence and incidence of pregnancy-related heart
disease are limited from most parts of the world. Sudden adult death
syndrome, peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), aortic dissection,
and myocardial infarction (MI) were the most common causes of
maternal death in the UK over the period 2006–08. [1][–][5] Knowledge of
the risks associated with CVDs during pregnancy and their management in pregnant women who suffer from serious pre-existing conditions is of pivotal importance for advising patients before pregnancy. [6]

Since all measures concern not only the mother but the foetus as
well, the optimum treatment of both must be targeted. A therapy
favourable for the mother can be associated with potential harm to
the developing child and, in extreme cases, treatment measures that
protect the survival of the mother can cause the death of the foetus.
On the other hand, therapies to protect the child may lead to a suboptimal outcome for the mother. Because prospective or randomized studies are frequently absent, recommendations in these
Guidelines mostly correspond to evidence level C. Therefore, registries and prospective studies are urgently needed to improve current
knowledge. [4][,][7] At the European level, the Registry Of Pregnancy And
Cardiac disease (ROPAC) registry of the ESC and the European
Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies network are providing data on
epidemiology and drug exposure in pregnancy. [4][,][8]

2.4 Methods

The current Guidelines are based on the previously published ESC
Guidelines on the management of CVDs during pregnancy, [9] the literature found in a systematic search from 2011–16 in the National
Institutes of Health database (PubMed), and on recent publications

and recommendations from the American Heart Association and the
American College of Cardiology. [10] Furthermore, we considered
related Guidelines of the ESC published in 2012–15 on the topics of
congenital heart disease, aortic disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies and heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD),
hypertension, pericardial diseases, pulmonary hypertension (PH),
infective endocarditis (IE), ventricular arrhythmias, and acute coronary syndromes, and on the topics of cancer treatment and cardiovascular toxicity, dyslipidaemias, atrial fibrillation (AF), and CVD

not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of
health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in
consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation
with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or
necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify
the rules and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time
of prescription.
### 2. Introduction

2.1 Why do we need new Guidelines on
the management of cardiovascular
diseases in pregnancy?
Since the previous version of these Guidelines was published in 2012,
new evidence has accumulated, particularly on diagnostic techniques,
risk assessment, and the use of cardiovascular drugs. This made a
revision of the recommendations necessary.

2.2 New format of the Guidelines

The new Guidelines have been adapted to facilitate their use in clinical practice and to meet readers’ demands by focusing on condensed,
clearly presented recommendations. At the end of each section, ‘recommendations’ summarize the essentials. ‘Gaps in the evidence’ are
listed in section 13 to propose topics for future research. The
Guidelines document is harmonized with the simultaneously published chapter on the management of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)
[in pregnancy of the ESC Textbook of Cardiology (http://oxfordmedi](http://oxfordmedicine.com/view/10.1093/med/9780199566990.001. 0001/med-9780199566990-chapter-33)

ESC Guidelines 3173



### 3. General considerations

3.1 Epidemiology
In the western world, the risk of CVD in pregnancy has increased
due to increasing age at first pregnancy. According to World Atlas, [27]

the 10 countries where mean age at first birth is highest record a
mean age between 28.8–31.2 years. The mild increase in maternal
age does not justify an increase in CVD during pregnancy because of
maternal age. However, pregnancies in the late reproductive years
(or between ages of 40–50 years) are more frequently associated
with an increasing prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, especially
diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Additionally, an increasing number of women with congenital heart disease reach childbearing age. [5]

In western countries, maternal heart disease is the major cause of . [.........................................]


maternal death during pregnancy. [2][,][28] The current background
information and detailed discussion of the data for the following sec
[tion of these Guidelines can be found in ESC CardioMed 53.1a](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0685)

[General considerations, 53.1b Pregnancy risk assessment and 53.2](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0685)
[Gynaecological, obstetric, and neonatological aspects.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0687)

Hypertensive disorders are the most frequent cardiovascular disorders during pregnancy, occurring in 5–10% of all pregnancies (see section 10). Among the other disease conditions, congenital heart disease
is the most frequent CVD present during pregnancy in the western
world (75–82%). [29][,][30] Rheumatic valvular disease dominates in nonwestern countries, comprising 56–89% of all CVDs in pregnancy. [29][,][31]

Peripartum intensive care unit (ICU) admissions are increasing in
frequency, with affected women-who suffer from serious preexisting conditions, are older, and present with multiple

3174 ESC Guidelines


comorbidities and also congenital heart disease-being more frequently admitted than in previous years. [6] The admission rate to ICUs
was 6.4 per 1000 deliveries, corresponding to 1 admission per 156
deliveries, in Vienna, Austria during the period 2011–14. A 5% mortality rate was also observed in the study and is considered as appropriate in comparison to the literature. [6]

Cardiomyopathies are rare, but represent severe causes of cardiovascular complications in pregnancy. [32]

3.2 Physiological adaptations to

pregnancy
Pregnancy induces changes in the cardiovascular system to meet the

increased metabolic demands of the mother and foetus. Plasma vol
ume and cardiac output (CO) reach a maximum of 40–50% above
baseline at 32 weeks of gestation, while 75% of this increase has
occurred by the end of the first trimester. The increase in CO is
achieved by an increase in stroke volume in the first-half of pregnancy
and a gradual increase in heart rate thereafter. Atrial and ventricular
diameters increase while ventricular function is preserved. In women
with heart disease, left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV)
adaptation to pregnancy can be suboptimal. [33][–][36] Maternal cardiac
dysfunction is related to impaired uteroplacental flow and suboptimal
foetal outcome. [35][–][37] Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances
decrease during pregnancy.

Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state associated with increased risk
of thrombo-embolism. Increased activity of liver enzyme systems,
glomerular filtration rate, and plasma volume, protein binding
changes, and decreased serum albumin levels contribute to changes
in the pharmacokinetics of many drugs. [36][,][38] Uterine contractions,
positioning (left lateral vs. supine), pain, anxiety, exertion, haemorrhage, and uterine involution cause significant haemodynamic changes
during labour and post-partum. Anaesthesia, haemorrhage, and infection may induce additional cardiovascular stress. Blood pressure (BP)
and CO increase during labour and post-partum. In conclusion, the
physiological adaptations to pregnancy influence the evaluation and
interpretation of cardiac function and clinical status.

3.3 Pre-pregnancy counselling

All women with known cardiac or aortic disease who wish to embark
on pregnancy require timely pre-pregnancy counselling. [39] Informed
maternal decision-making is crucial and there is a clear need for individualized care, taking into account not only the medical condition
but also the emotional and cultural context, psychological issues, and
ethical challenges. Especially in patients with a high-risk or possible
contraindication for pregnancy, the risk of pregnancy and the necessity of careful planning of pregnancy should be discussed at a young
age. However, it is also important to explain that many women can
go through pregnancy with low-risks.

For risk estimation, as a minimum, an electrocardiogram (ECG),
echocardiography, and an exercise test should be performed. In case
of aortic pathology, complete aortic imaging by computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary
for appropriate pre-conception counselling. Peak heart rate and peak
oxygen uptake are both known to be predictive of maternal cardiac
events in pregnancy. [40] A pregnancy exercise capacity >80% is associ
. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Several aspects must be discussed, including long-term prognosis, fertility and miscarriage rates, risk of recurrence of congenital disease, drug
therapy, estimated maternal risk and outcome, expected foetal outcomes, and plans for pregnancy care and delivery. A multidisciplinary
management plan should be constructed and discussed with the patient.
In addition, attention to unhealthy habits including being overweight,
smoking, and consuming alcohol is important, as these can have a clear
impact on maternal and foetal outcomes. Pregnancy is a very suitable
time for recommending a healthy lifestyle, including smoking cessation.

3.3.1 Risk of maternal cardiovascular complications
The risk of complications in pregnancy depends on the underlying
cardiac diagnosis, ventricular and valvular function, functional class,
presence of cyanosis, pulmonary artery pressures, and other factors.
Comorbidities, including for example rheumatoid and musculoskele
tal diseases as well as mental disorders, should also be taken into

account. Therefore, risk estimation should be individualized.

To assess the maternal risk of cardiac complications during pregnancy, the condition of the woman should be assessed, taking into
account medical history, functional class, oxygen saturation, natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiographic assessment of ventricular and
valvular function, intrapulmonary pressures and aortic diameters,
exercise capacity, and arrhythmias. Disease-specific risk should be
assessed using the modified World Health Organization (mWHO)
classification (Table 3) and as described in the respective sections
dealing with specific diseases in these Guidelines. Risk estimation
should be further refined by taking into account predictors that have
been identified in studies that included large populations with various
diseases, such as the CARPREG (CARdiac disease in PREGnancy),
ZAHARA, and ROPAC (Registry Of Pregnancy And Cardiac disease)
studies (Table 4). [29][,][41][–][43]

The mWHO classification is currently the most accurate system of
risk assessment, although it is probably more appropriate for developed,
rather than developing, countries. [4][,][11][,][44] The general principles of this
classification, and follow-up and management during pregnancy according to this mWHO classification, are presented in Table 3. Indications
for intervention (surgical or catheter) do not differ in women who contemplate pregnancy compared with other patients. The few exceptions

to this rule are women with at least moderate mitral stenosis and

women with aortic dilatation. See also the disease-specific sections of
these Guidelines. Fertility treatment is contraindicated in women with
mWHO class IV, and should be carefully considered in those who have
mWHO class III disease or who are anticoagulated. [45]

The risk estimation needs to be re-evaluated during each prepregnancy visit, because the risk of complications may change over
time. Natriuretic peptide levels are associated with the occurrence of
cardiac events, with N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) >128 pg/mL at 20 weeks pregnancy being predictive of
events later in the pregnancy. [46][,][47] Pre-eclampsia is associated with
HF in women with heart disease. [43]

3.3.2 Risk of obstetric and offspring complications

Women with cardiac disease have an increased risk of obstetric com
plications, including premature labour, pre-eclampsia, and postpartum haemorrhage.
Offspring complications occur in 18–30% of patients with heart
disease, with neonatal mortality between 1–4%. [29] Maternal and


Cardiomyopathies are rare, but represent severe causes of cardiovascular complications in pregnancy. [32]


3.2 Physiological adaptations to

pregnancy
Pregnancy induces changes in the cardiovascular system to meet the

increased metabolic demands of the mother and foetus. Plasma vol
ume and cardiac output (CO) reach a maximum of 40–50% above
baseline at 32 weeks of gestation, while 75% of this increase has
occurred by the end of the first trimester. The increase in CO is
achieved by an increase in stroke volume in the first-half of pregnancy
and a gradual increase in heart rate thereafter. Atrial and ventricular
diameters increase while ventricular function is preserved. In women
with heart disease, left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV)
adaptation to pregnancy can be suboptimal. [33][–][36] Maternal cardiac
dysfunction is related to impaired uteroplacental flow and suboptimal
foetal outcome. [35][–][37] Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances
decrease during pregnancy.

Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state associated with increased risk
of thrombo-embolism. Increased activity of liver enzyme systems,
glomerular filtration rate, and plasma volume, protein binding

in the pharmacokinetics of many drugs. [36][,][38] Uterine contractions,

during labour and post-partum. Anaesthesia, haemorrhage, and infection may induce additional cardiovascular stress. Blood pressure (BP)
and CO increase during labour and post-partum. In conclusion, the

for appropriate pre-conception counselling. Peak heart rate and peak
oxygen uptake are both known to be predictive of maternal cardiac
events in pregnancy. [40] A pregnancy exercise capacity >80% is associated with a favourable pregnancy outcome.

offspring events are highly correlated. [29][,][42][,][43] Though predictors of

validated prediction models. [4]

3.3.3 Pregnancy heart team
In women with a moderate or high-risk of complications during pregnancy (mWHO II–III, III, and IV), pre-pregnancy counselling and management during pregnancy and around delivery should be conducted
in an expert centre by a multidisciplinary team: the pregnancy heart
team. The minimum team requirements are a cardiologist, obstetrician, and anaesthetist, all with expertise in the management of highrisk pregnancies in women with heart disease. Additional experts
that may be involved, depending on the individual situation, are a
geneticist, cardiothoracic surgeon, paediatric cardiologist, foetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, haematologist, nurse specialist, pulmonary specialist, and others where appropriate. In this team patients
from other centres can also be discussed, so not every hospital needs
to have its own pregnancy heart team. The conclusions and recommendations should be filed and made available 24 h per day.

3.4 Cardiovascular diagnosis in

pregnancy
During pregnancy it can be more difficult to diagnose HF, for exam
. [...........................................................................]


(section 3.2) may mimic CVD. However, many disorders can be identified by taking a careful history and a thorough physical examination.
When disproportionate or unexplained dyspnoea occurs during
pregnancy and/or when a new pathological murmur (all audible diastolic murmurs are abnormal) is heard, echocardiography is indicated.
BP should be measured using a standardized method (section 10).
Proteinuria should be sought, especially with a history or family history of hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Oximetry should be performed in patients with congenital heart disease.

3.4.1 Electrocardiography
In most pregnant patients, the heart rotates to the left with a 15–20 [�]

leftward axis deviation on the ECG. Common additional findings
include transient ST/T wave changes, a Q wave and inverted T waves in
lead III, an attenuated Q wave in lead aVF, and inverted T waves in V1,

V2, and occasionally V3. Changes may mimic LV hypertrophy and other
structural heart diseases. Holter monitoring should be performed in
patients with known previous paroxysmal/persistent arrhythmia [ventricular tachycardia (VT), AF, or atrial flutter] or reporting palpitations.

3.4.2 Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography is the preferred imaging method in
pregnancy. This reproducible, widely available, relatively cheap diagnostic modality can be used both in the outpatient clinic and at the


3.3.3 Pregnancy heart team
In women with a moderate or high-risk of complications during pregnancy (mWHO II–III, III, and IV), pre-pregnancy counselling and management during pregnancy and around delivery should be conducted
in an expert centre by a multidisciplinary team: the pregnancy heart
team. The minimum team requirements are a cardiologist, obstetrician, and anaesthetist, all with expertise in the management of highrisk pregnancies in women with heart disease. Additional experts
that may be involved, depending on the individual situation, are a
geneticist, cardiothoracic surgeon, paediatric cardiologist, foetal medicine specialist, neonatologist, haematologist, nurse specialist, pulmonary specialist, and others where appropriate. In this team patients
from other centres can also be discussed, so not every hospital needs
to have its own pregnancy heart team. The conclusions and recommendations should be filed and made available 24 h per day.


3.4 Cardiovascular diagnosis in

pregnancy
During pregnancy it can be more difficult to diagnose HF, for example, because the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy

cardiology ward, and also at the emergency department, ICU, and
obstetric ward, and should be used with a low threshold. During
pregnancy, some changes in echo parameters are expected, such as
mild dilatation of the chambers, a change in LV wall thickness, and an
increase in valve gradient. [34][,][52] Transoesophageal echocardiography is
relatively safe; however, the risk of vomiting/aspiration and sudden
increases in intra-abdominal pressure should be considered, and foetal monitoring performed.

3.4.3 Exercise testing
Physiological exercise testing is an integral part of follow-up in adult
congenital heart disease and valve disease, [29][,][53] and should be performed in patients with known heart disease who plan pregnancy.
This Task Force recommends submaximal exercise testing (80% of
predicted maximal heart rate) in asymptomatic patients with suspected heart disease if already pregnant. There is no evidence that it
increases the risk of spontaneous miscarriage. [30] Stress echocardiography using bicycle ergometry may improve diagnostic specificity. [54]

Dobutamine stress is rarely indicated during pregnancy and, because
pregnancy in itself is a stress test, its use should be avoided when
other options are available.

3.4.4 Ionizing radiation exposure
The potential risks of ionizing radiation exposure to the foetus
depend on the stage of pregnancy and the absorbed dose. Risks are
highest during organogenesis and the early foetal period, less in the
second trimester, and least in the third trimester. [55] Malformations

are typically associated with the central nervous system. Early in pregnancy (including 0–8 days pre-implantation), the high incidence of
spontaneous abortion makes the evaluation of radiation-induced
pre-natal death difficult, although it occurs at other stages of gestation
with doses >250 mGy. Observed radiation-induced abnormalities
(typically at doses of 100–200 mGy) include growth restriction, intellectual disability, malignancies, and neurological effects. [56][,][57] The periods of greatest vulnerability include growth retardation at 8–56 days,
microcephaly at 14–105 days, and intellectual deficit/seizures/severe
mental impairment at 56–105 days. [58] An increased risk of childhood
cancer with in utero doses of approximately 20 mGy has been
reported, with an estimated 1–2 cases of childhood cancer occurring
per 3000 children exposed to 10 mGy of radiation in utero. [59] If possible, procedures should be delayed until at least the completion of the
period of major organogenesis (>12 weeks after menses).

All medical radiation doses must be kept ‘as low as reasonably
achievable’. If ionizing radiation is required, risks and benefits should

be communicated to the mother, and informed consent obtained.

The radiation dose to the foetus should be kept as low as possible
(preferably <50 mGy) with clear documentation, particularly if the
foetus is in the field of view (see section 3.7.1).

3.4.5 Chest radiography and computed tomography
Although the foetal dose from chest radiography is <0.01 mGy, it

symptoms. Lung ultrasound is a promising alternative imaging modality, although its use in pregnancy has yet to be clarified. CT is usually
not necessary for cardiac disease during pregnancy and is not recommended, except for the diagnosis or exclusion of pulmonary embolism (PE) or aortic pathology where other diagnostic tools are
insufficient (section 10), and where low radiation CT with 0.01–0.66
mGy can be used. [53][,][60]

3.4.6 Cardiac catheterization

Cardiac catheterization is seldom needed for diagnostic purposes,
but can be necessary to guide interventional procedures.
The mean radiation exposure to the unshielded abdomen is 1.5
mGy, and <20% of this reaches the foetus. For example, successful
closure of a patent foramen ovale was achieved with the Helex
device in three patients in the second trimester. Radiation doses, as
assessed by dose area product, were 260, 58, and 19 cGy/cm [2], with
estimated uterine (foetal) doses of <0.005, <0.001, and <0.0005
mGy, respectively. [61] The radial approach by an experienced operator
is preferable. Most electrophysiological studies should only be performed if arrhythmias are medically refractory and cause haemodynamic compromise. Electroanatomical mapping systems should be
used to reduce the radiation dose (section 3).

3.4.7 Magnetic resonance imaging
MRI is advised if other non-invasive diagnostic measures are not sufficient for definitive diagnosis, and is preferred to ionizing radiationbased imaging modalities when possible. [53][,][55] Evidence regarding
gadolinium-based contrast in pregnancy is controversial and its use
should be avoided if possible, especially in the first trimester.
Excretion of gadolinium-based agents into breast milk is limited

[<0.04% of an intravenous (i.v.) dose within the first 24 h, with 1–2%
absorption]. [62] Data suggest that it is safe to continue breastfeeding
after the administration of such agents.

3.5 Genetic testing and counselling
The risk of inheriting cardiac defects is raised significantly in comparison with parents without CVD, where the risk is approximately
1%. [63][,][64] Heritability varies between 3 and 50% depending on the type
of parental heart disease.

Children of parents with an autosomal dominant condition [e.g.
Marfan syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), or long QT
syndrome (LQTS)] have an inheritance risk of 50%.
The final phenotype will also be determined by incomplete penetrance and pleiotropic effects, and may vary significantly. [65] For defects
that are inherited in a polygenic manner, recurrence risk is less clearly
defined. Genetic testing in cardiomyopathies is not appropriate for
pre-natal diagnosis in dilated cardiomyopathies, except for selected
disorders or high-risk situations in the setting of expert teams after
detailed clinical and family assessment. [66]

In patients with venous thrombo-embolism (VTE), genetic testing
is considered to be justified only for relatives of probands with a deficiency of natural anticoagulants or after recurrent VTEs. [67]


3.4.3 Exercise testing
Physiological exercise testing is an integral part of follow-up in adult
congenital heart disease and valve disease, [29][,][53] and should be performed in patients with known heart disease who plan pregnancy.
This Task Force recommends submaximal exercise testing (80% of
predicted maximal heart rate) in asymptomatic patients with suspected heart disease if already pregnant. There is no evidence that it
increases the risk of spontaneous miscarriage. [30] Stress echocardiography using bicycle ergometry may improve diagnostic specificity. [54]

Dobutamine stress is rarely indicated during pregnancy and, because
pregnancy in itself is a stress test, its use should be avoided when
other options are available.

should only be performed if other methods fail to clarify the cause of

3178 ESC Guidelines


Genetic counselling by an expert in the specific genetic disorder is
highly recommended for patients and their family members in the situations below, and has the rationale of identifying at-risk asymptomatic or disease-free relatives and guiding clinical surveillance for
disease onset. [68][–][70] It is advocated in patients with known genetic disorders, especially if treatment options are available. [68]

Genetic counselling and parental testing may be useful:

 - [In cases of known carrier status of hereditary pulmonary arterial]
hypertension (PAH) or pulmonary veno-occlusive disease [71]

 - [In cardiomyopathies and channelopathies (e.g. LQTS)] [72]

 - [In congenital heart disease that is known to be associated with]
genetic abnormalities (e.g. conotruncal defects or bicuspid valve),
when the patient has dysmorphic features, developmental delay/
mental retardation, or when other non-cardiac congenital
abnormalities are present in syndromes such as in Marfan or
other heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD), 22q11 deletion,
Williams–Beuren, Alagille, Noonan, and Holt–Oram
syndromes [68]

 - [In thoracic aortic pathology]

 - [When other family members are affected.]

3.5.1 Pre-natal diagnosis
Presently, options for pre-natal genetic testing are increasingly available for those patients with an identified genetic defect (either chro
mosomal defects such as insertions/deletions/translocations or

single-gene defects). This includes (i) pre-gestational diagnosis or (ii)
pre-natal diagnosis, chorionic villus sampling, or amniocentesis.
Counselling should be provided by an experienced centre with an
interdisciplinary expert team.
An individualized approach to each family is required to ensure
autonomous choice and informed consent regarding pre-natal diagnostic testing within the local ethical and legal framework. [73]

3.6 Foetal assessment

3.6.1 Screening for congenital heart disease
Measurement of nuchal fold thickness around the 12th week of pregnancy to screen for chromosome abnormalities also screens for foetal congenital heart disease. [74] For major congenital heart disease, a
12-week ultrasound has a sensitivity and specificity of 85 [95% confidence interval (CI) 78–90%] and 99% (95% CI 98–100%), respectively. The incidence of congenital heart disease with normal nuchal
fold thickness is about 1/1000. [75] The earlier diagnosis of a major malformation allows parents to consider all options, including termination of pregnancy. [76]

All women with congenital heart disease should be offered foetal
echocardiography in the 19th–22nd weeks of pregnancy, with 45%
of all congenital cardiac malformations identified. [77][,][78] Foetal echocardiography should be performed by experienced specialists. [79][,][80]

When a foetal cardiac anomaly is suspected, it is mandatory to
obtain the following:

 - [Full foetal echocardiography]

 - [Detailed scanning to identify associated anomalies (digits and]

. [................................................................................................................................................................]



 - [Family history]

 - [Maternal medical history: medical disorders, viral illness, or tera-]
togenic medication

 - [Foetal karyotype (e.g. deletion in 22q11.2 with conotruncal]
anomalies)

 - [Referral to a foetal medicine specialist, paediatric cardiologist,]
geneticist, and neonatologist

 - [Delivery at an institution that can provide neonatal cardiac care.]

3.6.2 Assessing foetal wellbeing
In the context of foetal growth restriction, the aim is to determine
the optimal time for delivery, balancing foetal and neonatal risks. The
chance of disability-free survival increases by �2% per day between
24 and 28 weeks, and 1% per day thereafter until 32 weeks. Delivery
should be determined by umbilical artery and ductus venosus blood
flow patterns. [81][–][83]

3.7 Interventions in the mother during

pregnancy
3.7.1 Percutaneous therapy
If an intervention is absolutely necessary, the best time is after the 4th
month in the second trimester. By this time, organogenesis is complete, the foetal thyroid is still inactive, and the uterine volume is still
small, so there is a greater distance between the foetus and the chest
than in later months. ST-elevation MI (STEMI) management in pregnancy mainly relies on primary percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI). Thrombolysis may be a bailout, just as in non-pregnant
patients, and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator does not
cross the placenta but may induce bleeding complications (subplacental bleeding). Procedures should follow the ‘as low as reasonably
achievable’ principle. Manoeuvres to minimize radiation are: (i) use
echo guidance when possible; (ii) place the source as distant as possible from the patient and the receiver as close as possible to the
patient; (ii) use only low-dose fluoroscopy; (iv) favour anteroposterior projections; (v) avoid direct radiation of the abdominal region;
(vi) collimate as tightly as possible to the area of interest; (vii) minimize fluoroscopy time; and (viii) utilize an experienced cardiologist. [84][,][85] Abdominal shielding lowers the radiation dose to the
foetus to some degree; however, the presence of lead in the field of
the primary beam may on the other hand increase scattered radiation. As the benefit of shielding is limited, it should not interfere
with an optimal intervention. Monitoring and recording of radiation
exposure facilitates the future assessment of possible effects on the
foetus. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) has to be given at 40–70 U/kg
i.v., targeting an activated clotting time of 250 s (200–300 s) or an
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) two times that which is

normal.

3.7.2 Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass
Maternal mortality during cardiopulmonary bypass is now similar to
that in non-pregnant women. However, foetal mortality remains high
(�20%). [86] Cardiac surgery is recommended only when medical therapy or interventional procedures fail and the mother’s life is


Genetic counselling and parental testing may be useful:

threatened. The best period for surgery is between the 13th and
28th weeks. With full maternal and foetal monitoring and attention
to cardiopulmonary bypass, particularly the use of pulsatile perfusion,

the risks to both the mother and the foetus can be minimized.
Gestational age has a large impact on neonatal outcome. [87][,][88]

Caesarean delivery may be considered before cardiopulmonary
bypass if gestational age is >26 weeks. [86] Whether or not delivery is
advantageous for the baby at this gestational age depends on gender,
estimated weight, prior administration of corticosteroids before
delivery, and the outcome statistics of the neonatal unit concerned.
When gestational age is >_28 weeks, delivery before surgery should
be considered. Before surgery, a full course (two doses of betamethasone 12 mg intramuscularly 12 h apart) of corticosteroids should
be administered to the mother, whenever possible. During cardiopulmonary bypass, foetal heart rate and uterine tone should be monitored, and cardiopulmonary bypass time should be minimized for
better foetal outcomes. [89][,][90]

3.8 Timing and mode of delivery: risk for
mother and child

A delivery plan should be made with details of induction, management of labour, delivery, and post-partum surveillance. The emotional context, psychological care, and ethical challenges should also
be taken into account. This delivery plan should be widely disseminated and placed in the patient’s hand-held notes. Specific expertise
and collaborative management by a pregnancy heart team in specialist
centres is mandatory for all moderate- and high-risk patients.

3.8.1 Timing of delivery
Induction of labour should be considered at 40 weeks of gestation in
all women with cardiac disease; this reduces the risk of emergency
caesarean section by 12% and the risk of stillbirth by 50% in women
without heart disease, and the benefit is likely to be greater for
women with heart disease [91] who have higher rates of obstetric complications. [92] Timing of induction will depend on cardiac status, obstetric evaluation including cervical assessment, foetal well-being, and
foetal lung maturity.

3.8.2 Labour induction

Both misoprostol [25 mg, prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1 )] or dinoprostone

[1–3 mg or slow-release formulation of 10 mg (PGE 2 )] can be used
safely to induce labour. Reassuringly, in women without heart disease, high-dose (600 mg) misoprostol has no effect on cardiac parameters, [93] although there remains a theoretical risk of coronary
vasospasm and arrhythmias. Dinoprostone may cause profound
hypotension, but only when injected blindly into the myometrium, [94]

and this route of administration should be avoided. Mechanical meth
ods such as a cervical ripening balloon might be preferable in patients
where a drop in systemic vascular resistance would be detrimental. [95]

Artificial rupture of membranes and infusion of oxytocin can be used

. [...............................................................................................................................................................]


3.8.3 Vaginal or caesarean delivery

The ROPAC data show that elective caesarean section carries no

maternal benefit and results in earlier delivery and lower birth
weight. [96] Vaginal delivery is associated with less blood loss and lower

risk of infection, venous thrombosis, and embolism, and should be

advised for most women. Caesarean section should be considered

for obstetric indications and for patients presenting in labour on oral
anticoagulants (OACs), with aggressive aortic pathology, and in acute

intractable HF. Caesarean section is advised in severe forms of PH

(including Eisenmenger’s syndrome).

3.8.4 Delivery in anticoagulated women (not including
mechanical valve; see section 5)
For women with a planned caesarean section, therapeutic low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) dosing can be simply omitted for
24 h prior to surgery. If delivery has to be performed earlier, then
anti-Xa activity can guide the timing of the procedure. In high-risk
women, therapeutic UFH can be restarted at 6 h post-delivery. In
women at moderate or low-risk, a single prophylactic dose of
LMWH-for example, in the case of enoxaparin, 20 mg if weight is
<50 kg, 40 mg if 50–90 kg, and for women with a raised body mass
index (BMI) 0.5 mg/kg-can be given at 6 h post-delivery, before
restarting therapeutic LMWH 12 h later.
If vaginal delivery is planned, moderate- and high-risk patients can
be converted to an infusion of UFH with regular checks of aPTT to
optimize control, and the infusion stopped at least 4–6 hours prior
to insertion of regional anaesthesia or anticipated delivery. For
women at low-risk, therapeutic LMWH can be omitted for 24 h prior
to anticipated delivery. Anticoagulation can be restarted as above.

3.8.5 Urgent delivery on therapeutic anticoagulation
Delivery in a patient taking therapeutic anticoagulation carries a highrisk of maternal haemorrhage. For UFH, protamine sulfate should be
given, the exact dose depending on the mode of administration and
time since the last dose of UFH (please refer to the European
[Medicines Agency statement: https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/8)
[product/8). In the case of LMWH, protamine sulfate should be given;](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/product/8)
however, not only may antifactor Xa activity remain prolonged and
bleeding tendency persist, [97] but the half-life of LMWH is longer and
absorption after subcutaneous injection is prolonged, such that
repeated doses or an infusion of protamine sulfate may be required.
If the patient is on OACs, caesarean section is preferred to reduce
the risk of foetal intracranial haemorrhage.

Reversal of anticoagulation is better with four-factor prothrombin
complex concentrate, best given as an individualized dose dependent
on maternal weight, initial international normalized ratio (INR), and
target INR [98] than fresh frozen plasma (12–15 mL/kg), [99] and should
be given prior to caesarean delivery to achieve an INR <_1.5; however, none of the available algorithms have been validated in pregnant
women. Vitamin K (5–10 mg i.v.) may also be given, but may take up
to 8–12 h to reverse the INR and has a persistent effect making reanticoagulation more difficult. The foetus may remain anticoagulated


Caesarean delivery may be considered before cardiopulmonary
bypass if gestational age is >26 weeks. [86] Whether or not delivery is
advantageous for the baby at this gestational age depends on gender,
estimated weight, prior administration of corticosteroids before
delivery, and the outcome statistics of the neonatal unit concerned.
When gestational age is >_28 weeks, delivery before surgery should
be considered. Before surgery, a full course (two doses of betamethasone 12 mg intramuscularly 12 h apart) of corticosteroids should
be administered to the mother, whenever possible. During cardiopulmonary bypass, foetal heart rate and uterine tone should be monitored, and cardiopulmonary bypass time should be minimized for
better foetal outcomes. [89][,][90]


3.8 Timing and mode of delivery: risk for
mother and child

A delivery plan should be made with details of induction, management of labour, delivery, and post-partum surveillance. The emotional context, psychological care, and ethical challenges should also
be taken into account. This delivery plan should be widely disseminated and placed in the patient’s hand-held notes. Specific expertise
and collaborative management by a pregnancy heart team in specialist
centres is mandatory for all moderate- and high-risk patients.


3.8.1 Timing of delivery
Induction of labour should be considered at 40 weeks of gestation in
all women with cardiac disease; this reduces the risk of emergency
caesarean section by 12% and the risk of stillbirth by 50% in women
without heart disease, and the benefit is likely to be greater for
women with heart disease [91] who have higher rates of obstetric complications. [92] Timing of induction will depend on cardiac status, obstetric evaluation including cervical assessment, foetal well-being, and
foetal lung maturity.


3.8.2 Labour induction

Both misoprostol [25 mg, prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1 )] or dinoprostone

[1–3 mg or slow-release formulation of 10 mg (PGE 2 )] can be used
safely to induce labour. Reassuringly, in women without heart disease, high-dose (600 mg) misoprostol has no effect on cardiac parameters, [93] although there remains a theoretical risk of coronary
vasospasm and arrhythmias. Dinoprostone may cause profound
hypotension, but only when injected blindly into the myometrium, [94]

and this route of administration should be avoided. Mechanical meth
ods such as a cervical ripening balloon might be preferable in patients
where a drop in systemic vascular resistance would be detrimental. [95]

Artificial rupture of membranes and infusion of oxytocin can be used
safely in women with heart disease.

3180 ESC Guidelines


for 8–10 days after discontinuation of maternal OACs, and may need
to be given fresh frozen plasma as well as vitamin K.

3.8.6 Haemodynamic monitoring during delivery
Maternal BP and heart rate should be monitored in all patients with

cardiac disease. In women with more severe heart disease, an arterial

line provides more accurate data. Pulse oximetry and continuous
ECG monitoring are advised to detect early signs of decompensation,
and to identify those in whom delivery should be expedited. A SwanGanz catheter is of uncertain benefit, is associated with complications, and should be avoided in most cases. [100] In some high-risk
patients (PH), right atrial pressure monitoring may be considered.

3.8.7 Anaesthesia/analgesia
Epidural analgesia reduces labour pain and can be used to provide
anaesthesia for caesarean section if necessary. However, it can cause
systemic hypotension (10%) and must be carefully titrated, especially
in patients with obstructive valve lesions or diminished ventricular
function who may benefit from invasive BP monitoring. All i.v. fluids
need to be used carefully. [101]

3.8.8 Labour

Mobilization may facilitate foetal head descent and a lateral decubitus
position can attenuate the haemodynamic impact of cava compression by the gravid uterus. [102] The active phase of the second stage
should be delayed for 2 h to allow maximal descent of the foetal
head, as this will shorten the active phase of the second stage. [103][,][104]

Assisted delivery with forceps or a ventouse may be used to further
reduce maternal effort, as indicated by the underlying cardiac lesion.
Continuous electronic foetal heart rate monitoring is recommended.

3.8.9 Perimortem caesarean section

In the case of an acute life-threatening maternal event, immediate
delivery should be considered. The aim of delivery is to improve the
chance of successfully resuscitating the mother and, only secondarily,
of improving foetal survival. It should be considered from 24 weeks
of gestation, as prior to this time the degree of uterine vena cava
compression is limited and the baby is not considered to be viable.
The delivery should be performed within 4 min of the cardiac arrest.

3.8.10 Post-partum care
A slow i.v. infusion of oxytocin (2 U of oxytocin given over 10 min
immediately after birth, followed by 12 mU/min for 4 h) reduces the
risk of post-partum haemorrhage and has a minimal impact on cardiovascular parameters. [105] PGE [106] analogues [sulprostone (100–500
mg/h) and misoprostol (200–1000 mg)] can be used to treat postpartum haemorrhage; however, ergometrine and prostaglandin F
analogues should be avoided. [107][,][108] Sulprostone should be used with
caution, given its association with cardiovascular or respiratory symptoms. Meticulous leg care, elastic support stockings, and early ambu
. [.............................................................................................................................................................]


post-partum period is associated with significant haemodynamic
changes and fluid shifts, particularly in the first 24–48 h after delivery,
which may precipitate HF. Haemodynamic monitoring should therefore be continued for at least 24–48 h in those at risk. [43] With preceding beta-blockade, infant monitoring for 48 h is recommended. [109]

3.8.11 Breastfeeding
Lactation is associated with a low-risk of bacteraemia secondary to
mastitis and should be encouraged in patients with heart disease
whenever possible. Any specific concerns or contraindications are
discussed in the disease section (i.e. section 8). Most drugs used in
patients enter the milk and could thus contraindicate breastfeeding
(see Table 7 for details of drugs and safety data). If needed, inhibition
of lactation can be obtained with standard doses of cabergoline (0.25
mg every 12 h for 2 days), or bromocriptine (2.5 mg on the day of
delivery, followed by 2.5 mg twice daily for 14 days) if cabergoline is

not available.

3.9 Infective endocarditis

IE is rare, with an overall annual incidence estimated at 1 per 1000 in
patients with congenital heart disease, [110][,][111] and between 3 and 12
per 1000 in patients with prosthetic valves. [112]

3.9.1 Prophylaxis
The same measures apply as in non-pregnant patients. [112] During
delivery, the indication for prophylaxis has been controversial and,
given the lack of convincing evidence, antibiotic prophylaxis is not
recommended during vaginal or caesarean delivery. Non-specific
hygiene and asepsis measures are also important to prevent
endocarditis. [112]

3.9.2 Diagnosis and risk assessment
The diagnosis of IE during pregnancy involves the same criteria as in
the non-pregnant patient. [112] The scarcity of data accounts for wide
ranges in estimations of maternal and foetal mortality of 11–33 and
14–29%, respectively. [111][,][113][,][114]

Unlike chronic valvular regurgitations, acute regurgitations due to
IE are poorly tolerated and often cause severe HF. Cerebral and
peripheral embolisms are also frequent. [111] Every pregnant patient
with IE should be discussed by an endocarditis team.

3.9.3 Treatment

IE should be treated in the same way as in the non-pregnant
patient. [112] Antibiotics should be given according to guidelines, guided
by culture and antibiotic sensitivity results, considering the potential
foetotoxic effects of antibiotics (see Table 7 for details of drugs and
safety data). [115] Antibiotics that can be given during all trimesters of
pregnancy are penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, daptomycin, erythromycin, mezlocillin, oxacillin, and cephalosporins. There is a definite
risk to the foetus in all trimesters of pregnancy with aminoglycosides


3.8.6 Haemodynamic monitoring during delivery
Maternal BP and heart rate should be monitored in all patients with

cardiac disease. In women with more severe heart disease, an arterial

line provides more accurate data. Pulse oximetry and continuous
ECG monitoring are advised to detect early signs of decompensation,
and to identify those in whom delivery should be expedited. A SwanGanz catheter is of uncertain benefit, is associated with complications, and should be avoided in most cases. [100] In some high-risk
patients (PH), right atrial pressure monitoring may be considered.


3.8.7 Anaesthesia/analgesia
Epidural analgesia reduces labour pain and can be used to provide
anaesthesia for caesarean section if necessary. However, it can cause
systemic hypotension (10%) and must be carefully titrated, especially
in patients with obstructive valve lesions or diminished ventricular
function who may benefit from invasive BP monitoring. All i.v. fluids
need to be used carefully. [101]


3.8.8 Labour

Mobilization may facilitate foetal head descent and a lateral decubitus
position can attenuate the haemodynamic impact of cava compression by the gravid uterus. [102] The active phase of the second stage
should be delayed for 2 h to allow maximal descent of the foetal
head, as this will shorten the active phase of the second stage. [103][,][104]

Assisted delivery with forceps or a ventouse may be used to further
reduce maternal effort, as indicated by the underlying cardiac lesion.
Continuous electronic foetal heart rate monitoring is recommended.


3.8.9 Perimortem caesarean section

In the case of an acute life-threatening maternal event, immediate
delivery should be considered. The aim of delivery is to improve the
chance of successfully resuscitating the mother and, only secondarily,
of improving foetal survival. It should be considered from 24 weeks
of gestation, as prior to this time the degree of uterine vena cava
compression is limited and the baby is not considered to be viable.
The delivery should be performed within 4 min of the cardiac arrest.


3.8.10 Post-partum care
A slow i.v. infusion of oxytocin (2 U of oxytocin given over 10 min
immediately after birth, followed by 12 mU/min for 4 h) reduces the
risk of post-partum haemorrhage and has a minimal impact on cardiovascular parameters. [105] PGE [106] analogues [sulprostone (100–500
mg/h) and misoprostol (200–1000 mg)] can be used to treat postpartum haemorrhage; however, ergometrine and prostaglandin F
analogues should be avoided. [107][,][108] Sulprostone should be used with
caution, given its association with cardiovascular or respiratory symptoms. Meticulous leg care, elastic support stockings, and early ambulation are important to reduce the risk of thrombo-embolism. The

ESC Guidelines 3181


and tetracyclines, and they should therefore only be used for vital
indications. [115]

Given the inherent foetal risk, decision-making for valve surgery
during pregnancy is particularly difficult. [112] Urgent surgery is mandatory in cardiogenic shock or refractory HF due to acute regurgitation.
When surgery is indicated for uncontrolled infection or prevention
of embolism, an individual approach should weigh the foetal risk of
surgery and the risk of maternal complications under medical therapy
alone. A viable foetus should be delivered prior to surgery where
possible. These patients should be managed in tertiary centres, and
the endocarditis and pregnancy teams should interact closely.

3.10 Methods of contraception and
termination of pregnancy, and in vitro
fertilization

3.10.1 Methods of contraception
The risk of using a particular type of contraception needs to be balanced against the risk of pregnancy, estimated using the modified
WHO classification (see above), [116] which assesses the risk with each
method for a given medical condition. [117] Advice is best provided by
cardiologists with appropriate training or obstetricians, and should be
given from the time of menarche since an unplanned pregnancy has
to be avoided. The average age of first intercourse in the UK is 17
years, with <_30% before 15 years, [118] regardless of the presence of
heart disease. [119] The key issues are reliability and the potential for
complications, with thrombosis and infection being the most important. Hormonal contraception can have important non-contraceptive
benefits, including the control of menstruation, prevention of anaemia, reduction of dysmenorrhoea, and of hyperandrogenism. [120]

Ethinyloestradiol-containing contraceptives have the greatest risk
of thrombosis [121][,][122] and are not advised in women with high-risk of
thrombo-embolic disease; they also increase BP and are contraindicated in pre-existing hypertension. [117] Progestin-only contraceptives
are an alternative, since they have little (implant or depot injection)
or no (levonorgestrel-loaded intrauterine device or oral desogestrel)
effect on coagulation factors, BP, and lipid levels. [123] Oral desogestrel
inhibits ovulation, which could be an advantage for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, or dysfunctional uterine
bleeding.

Levonorgestrel-based long-acting reversible contraception
implants or intrauterine devices are the safest and most effective contraceptives. However, intrauterine device insertion may cause a vasovagal response; consequently, this should be performed in a hospital
setting, particularly for Fontan and Eisenmenger’s syndrome patients.
The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device reduces periods,
causing amenorrhoea in <_60% of women, in contrast to copper intrauterine devices, which cause heavier periods. The newer, smaller
levonorgestrel-based intrauterine devices are easier to insert, reducing the risk of pain and therefore vasovagal response.
Barrier methods are unreliable but reduce the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. A good approach is the combination of barrier meth

long-acting reversible contraception, progestin-releasing implant, or
progestin-releasing intrauterine devices).
For emergency contraception, a copper intrauterine device is
most effective and additionally provides ongoing contraception.
Alternatively, a single dose of 1.5 mg levonorgestrel is effective if
taken within 72 h after unprotected sex (1.1% failure rate), [124] with
no evidence of increased rates of thrombosis. [125] The progesterone
receptor modulator ulipristal acetate (UPA) has been shown to be
more effective than levonorgestrel. UPA is not associated with an
increased risk of thrombosis. [126][,][127]

3.10.2 Sterilization

Sterilization by tubal ligation is not unreasonable if pregnancy is contraindicated or the family is complete. Laparoscopy is not without
risks in patients with PAH, cyanosis, and a Fontan circulation, and the
risks are probably lower with the hysteroscopic method performed
under regional anaesthesia. [128] Vasectomy is an effective option.

3.10.3 Methods of termination of pregnancy
Pregnancy termination should be discussed if there is a high-risk of
maternal morbidity or mortality, and/or of foetal abnormality. Both
medical and surgical methods are effective with similar rates of major
complications, but the greater need for unanticipated operative evacuation (2.1 vs. 0.6%) favours the surgical approach in this group of
women. [129] High-risk patients should be managed in an experienced
centre with on-site cardiac surgery. Antibiotics are given to reduce
the risk of endometritis and these should be modified to provide
endocarditis prophylaxis. Medical terminations can be considered up
to 9 weeks of gestation using a reduced misoprostol dose of 100 mg.

3.10.4 In vitro fertilization

The rates of subfertility in most women with heart disease are likely
to those of the general population, [130] but their management is more
complex. Hysteroscopy and laparoscopy can be life-threatening procedures in women with some forms of heart disease (PH and
Fontan), and should be undertaken in an experienced centre with
appropriate support. Assisted reproduction has added risks above
those of pregnancy alone; superovulation is pro-thrombotic and can
be complicated by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), with
marked fluid shifts and an even greater risk of thrombosis. The risk of
OHSS can be reduced by careful cycle monitoring, using low-dose
follicle-stimulating hormone in combination with a gonadotropinreleasing hormone antagonist, freezing all embryos, or only transferring a single embryo. [131] The last option is strongly advised in women
with heart disease, since conceiving a multiple pregnancy is associated
with greater cardiovascular changes [132] and more maternal and foetal
complications.133 Pregnancy, and consequently fertility treatment, is

contraindicated in women with mWHO class IV. In women with

mWHO class III or those who are anticoagulated, the risk of superovulation is very high and the alternative of natural cycle in vitro fertil
ization should be considered.


Given the inherent foetal risk, decision-making for valve surgery
during pregnancy is particularly difficult. [112] Urgent surgery is mandatory in cardiogenic shock or refractory HF due to acute regurgitation.
When surgery is indicated for uncontrolled infection or prevention
of embolism, an individual approach should weigh the foetal risk of
surgery and the risk of maternal complications under medical therapy
alone. A viable foetus should be delivered prior to surgery where
possible. These patients should be managed in tertiary centres, and
the endocarditis and pregnancy teams should interact closely.

### 4. Congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension

4.1 Introduction
Congenital heart disease is present in 0.8–0.9% of live births. [63][,][136]

Lesions vary in severity, but even patients with complex lesions now
survive to childbearing years. [137] In large international surveys of


. [....................]


pregnancy and heart disease, two-thirds of cases have congenital heart
disease and 5% have PH. [92][,][138] However, congenital heart disease and
PH are rare causes of maternal death. [3] The current background
information and detailed discussion of the data for the following sec
[tion of these Guidelines can be found in ESC CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0688)

In most women with congenital heart disease, pregnancy is well
tolerated. The risk of pregnancy depends on the underlying heart

defect as well as on additional factors such as ventricular function,

functional class, and cyanosis. Maternal cardiac complications are
present in �10% of completed pregnancies and are more frequent in
mothers with complex disease. Patients who experience complications during pregnancy may also be at higher risk of late cardiac
events after pregnancy. [139] Obstetric complications such as (pre-)
eclampsia are more often encountered. Offspring complications,
including miscarriage, prematurity, and neonatal death, are increased.

Diagnosis. In most cases, congenital heart disease is diagnosed well
before pregnancy, giving the opportunity for a full pre-pregnancy risk
assessment. The mWHO classes (Table 3) outline the broad risk

categories.

4.2 Pulmonary hypertension and
Eisenmenger’s syndrome
4.2.1 Pulmonary hypertension

4.2.1.1 Introduction

PH has many causes and is defined by an elevation in mean pulmonary
arterial pressure (PAP) >_25 mmHg at right heart catheterization. The
term PAH describes a subset of PH characterized by an LV filling
pressure <_15 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance >3 Wood
Units. [23] Untreated, idiopathic PH results in death within a median of
2.8 years. PAH is frequently encountered in females and the first clinical manifestations may be seen in pregnancy. [140]

4.2.1.2 Maternal risk

Maternal outcome, which varies according to the PH subset, has
improved with the availability of new targeted therapies and the use of
a team-based, multidisciplinary approach. [141][–][143] While pregnancy
appears safer today, mortality remains high in women with PAH
(16–30% maternal mortality). [137][,][138] Therefore, the recommendation
to avoid pregnancy remains and, when pregnancy occurs, termination
should be discussed. The greatest period of risk is the puerperium and
early post-partum. These women should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, with a PH expert included, in an expert centre for pregnancy and cardiac disease. Pulmonary hypertensive crisis, pulmonary
thrombosis, and right HF are the most common causes of death. This
may occur even in patients with few symptoms prior to pregnancy.
Risk factors for maternal death are: severity of PH, late hospitalization,
and perhaps the use of general anaesthesia. [144] Even moderate forms of
pulmonary vascular disease can worsen during pregnancy. [138] Although
there is no safe cut-off for elevated PAP risk, it is thought to be less in
those with only mildly increased pressure. [138]

4.2.1.3 Obstetric and offspring risk
There is increased foetal and neonatal (0–30%) mortality, particularly if
there is preterm delivery, reduced maternal CO, and/or hypoxaemia.

4.2.1.4 Management
The usual diagnostic algorithm of PH should be followed when a
pregnant patient presents with new PH. Echocardiography is key and
other diagnostic steps, in keeping with the PH guideline, are planned
individually. Invasive right heart catheterization is recommended if
there is diagnostic uncertainty and to assist important therapeutic
decisions. If this is required, it should be performed in a specialist

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


A multidisciplinary team is required to care for the pregnant PH
patient. This should be tailored to the patient, but will require very
regular follow-up (often weekly in the third trimester). A full assessment, including oxygen saturation and assessment of RV function,
should occur at each visit. Bed rest may be required in symptomatic
patients and additional risk factors (such as air travel) avoided.
Thrombo-embolism is a major risk and anticoagulation should be
considered (see section 11). Diuretics may be needed in patients
with HF and iron deficiency should be treated.
Pregnancy in PAH patients is a high-risk condition and a proactive
approach should be taken to commencing advanced therapies. Risk
stratification should be performed as in non-pregnant patients. There
is no evidence of benefit comparing a stepwise approach vs. early
combination therapy in pregnant patients, although the latter is often
favoured, as per our Guidelines. Bosentan and other endothelin
receptor antagonists are associated with embryopathy, and should
be discontinued unless doing so would greatly increase maternal risk.
An individualized approach is required and many units start therapy
with oral sildenafil. The subset of patients with true vasodilator
responsiveness who are well controlled on calcium channel blocker
(CCB) therapy may be at lower risk and this therapy should be continued, as should all i.v. therapies. Section 12 discusses specific medications, including potential interactions with contraceptive drugs and
anticoagulants.

4.2.1.5 Delivery
A detailed delivery plan, including the optimal mode and timing of
delivery, should be decided by the pregnancy heart team. This should
include the post-partum need for intensive care and mechanical support. Regional anaesthesia is usually favoured over general anaesthesia. [145] Meticulous fluid balance and optimization of RV function are
important determinants of a good outcome. Patients remain at highrisk for many months post-delivery, and individualized counselling is
needed to discuss the need for ongoing therapies and the avoidance
of future pregnancies. Therapies should not be discontinued in the
early post-delivery period.

4.2.2 Eisenmenger’s syndrome

4.2.2.1 Maternal risk

Eisenmenger patients require special consideration because of the
additional complications of cyanosis, right-to-left shunting, and paradoxical embolism. During pregnancy, systemic vasodilatation
increases the right-to-left shunt and decreases pulmonary flow, leading to increased cyanosis and a low CO. Maternal mortality is high
(20–50%) and termination of pregnancy should be discussed. [146]

However, termination also carries a risk.

4.2.2.2 Foetal risk

Foetal and neonatal risks are increased and relate to maternal CO

and cyanosis. Miscarriage is common. Maternal hypoxaemia is the
most important predictor of outcome.

4.2.2.3 Management
Many of the principles of caring for non-Eisenmenger PAH apply.
However, patients with Eisenmenger’s syndrome are at increased
risk of thrombocytopenia, deficiencies in vitamin K-dependent


Diagnosis. In most cases, congenital heart disease is diagnosed well
before pregnancy, giving the opportunity for a full pre-pregnancy risk
assessment. The mWHO classes (Table 3) outline the broad risk

clotting factors, and bleeding. Caution is therefore needed if prescribing antiplatelet therapy or LMWH. The evidence base for using
advanced therapies is less developed. However, sildenafil (and other
phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as tadalafil and vardenafil) is often
prescribed, with the addition of prostanoids in patients who remain
symptomatic. [147] Care should be exercised if prescribing drugs that
may lead to sudden systemic vasodilation or a risk of paradoxical air
embolism (i.v. therapies). Advanced therapies for Eisenmenger
patients should only be prescribed by experienced pregnancy heart
teams including a PH expert. The principles guiding delivery are as
per other forms of PH as above.

4.2.3 Cyanotic heart disease without pulmonary
hypertension

4.2.3.1 Maternal risk

Cyanotic congenital heart disease is usually repaired before pregnancy, but some balanced, inoperable, or palliated cases do reach
childbearing age. [148] Maternal complications (HF, thrombosis,
arrhythmias, and endocarditis) occur in >_15% of cyanotic pregnant
patients. Maternal outcome will be determined by the underlying

condition and the ventricular function rather than the saturation

level.

4.2.3.2 Foetal risk

If oxygen saturation is >90%, then there is usually a better foetal outcome (10% foetal loss). If oxygen saturation is <85%, foetal growth
restriction, prematurity, and foetal death are common and pregnancy
should be discouraged (live birth rate of only 12%). [149]

4.3 Specific congenital heart defects

4.3.1 Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction

The principles for managing supravalvular or subvalvular LV outflow

tract obstruction are the same as those for valvular aortic stenosis

(AS) (section 5). However, balloon valvuloplasty is not a therapeutic

option.

4.3.2 Atrial septal defect

4.3.2.1 Maternal risk

Pregnancy is well tolerated by most women with repaired atrial septal defect (ASD) (WHO risk class I). In unrepaired ASDs, thromboembolic complications have been described (5%). Atrial arrhythmias
occur, especially when the ASD is unrepaired or closed at an older
age. [150]

4.3.2.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
In women with unrepaired ASD, pre-eclampsia and growth restriction may occur more frequently.

4.3.2.3 Management
For a secundum defect, catheter device closure can be performed
during pregnancy but is rarely indicated. If device closure is performed, antiplatelet therapy will be required. Closure for the prevention of paradoxical emboli is not indicated. In women with a residual
shunt, prevention of venous stasis (compression stockings and minimizing bed rest) is important and extra care should be taken to avoid
air in i.v. lines. . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


4.3.3 Ventricular septal defect

4.3.3.1 Maternal risk

Small or repaired ventricular septal defects (VSDs) (without left heart
dilatation or ventricular dysfunction) have a low-risk of complications
during pregnancy (mWHO I and II).

4.3.3.2 Obstetric and offspring risk

There is no evidence of increased obstetric risks.

4.3.3.3 Management
Patients should usually be reviewed once or twice during pregnancy

with surveillance for PH.

4.3.4 Atrioventricular septal defect

4.3.4.1 Maternal risk

After ASD repair, pregnancy is usually well tolerated (WHO risk
class II–III). However, arrhythmias and worsening atrioventricular
(AV) valve regurgitation have been described. The risk of HF is low,
and only exists in women with severe regurgitation or impaired ven
tricular function.

4.3.4.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
Offspring mortality has been reported in 6% of cases, primarily due
to the recurrence of congenital heart disease.

4.3.4.3 Management
Follow-up is advisable at least once each trimester. This should be
increased to monthly or bimonthly in patients with significant valve
regurgitation or impaired ventricular function.

4.3.5 Coarctation of the aorta

4.3.5.1 Maternal risk

Pregnancy is often well tolerated in women after repair of coarctation of the aorta (CoA) (WHO risk class II). In women with unrepaired CoA and those repaired who have systemic hypertension,
residual CoA or aortic aneurysms have an increased risk of complications including dissection. Other risk factors include aortic dilatation
and bicuspid aortic valve.

4.3.5.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
An excess of hypertensive disorders, including pre-eclampsia and
miscarriages, has been reported.

4.3.5.3 Management
Close surveillance of BP is warranted and follow-up, at least every trimester, is indicated. Hypertension should be treated and care should
be taken to avoid placental hypoperfusion in those with residual
coarctation. Percutaneous intervention for re-CoA (using a covered
stent) is possible during pregnancy, but should only be performed for
refractory hypertension or maternal or foetal compromise.

4.3.6 Pulmonary valve and right ventricular outflow tract

disease

4.3.6.1 Maternal risk

Pulmonary (valve) stenosis (PS) is generally well tolerated. However,
severe stenosis may result in complications including RV failure and


4.2.3 Cyanotic heart disease without pulmonary
hypertension

4.2.3.1 Maternal risk

Cyanotic congenital heart disease is usually repaired before pregnancy, but some balanced, inoperable, or palliated cases do reach
childbearing age. [148] Maternal complications (HF, thrombosis,
arrhythmias, and endocarditis) occur in >_15% of cyanotic pregnant
patients. Maternal outcome will be determined by the underlying

condition and the ventricular function rather than the saturation

level.


4.2.3.2 Foetal risk

If oxygen saturation is >90%, then there is usually a better foetal outcome (10% foetal loss). If oxygen saturation is <85%, foetal growth
restriction, prematurity, and foetal death are common and pregnancy
should be discouraged (live birth rate of only 12%). [149]


4.3 Specific congenital heart defects

4.3.1 Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction

The principles for managing supravalvular or subvalvular LV outflow

tract obstruction are the same as those for valvular aortic stenosis

(AS) (section 5). However, balloon valvuloplasty is not a therapeutic

option.


4.3.2 Atrial septal defect

4.3.2.1 Maternal risk

Pregnancy is well tolerated by most women with repaired atrial septal defect (ASD) (WHO risk class I). In unrepaired ASDs, thromboembolic complications have been described (5%). Atrial arrhythmias
occur, especially when the ASD is unrepaired or closed at an older
age. [150]


4.3.2.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
In women with unrepaired ASD, pre-eclampsia and growth restriction may occur more frequently.


4.3.2.3 Management
For a secundum defect, catheter device closure can be performed
during pregnancy but is rarely indicated. If device closure is performed, antiplatelet therapy will be required. Closure for the prevention of paradoxical emboli is not indicated. In women with a residual
shunt, prevention of venous stasis (compression stockings and minimizing bed rest) is important and extra care should be taken to avoid

an independent predictor of maternal complications, especially in
patients with impaired RV function.

4.3.6.2 Obstetric and offspring risk

There is no evidence of increased obstetric risks.

4.3.6.3 Management
Mild and moderate PS are low-risk lesions (WHO risk classes I and II)
and two or three follow-up sessions are sufficient. In patients with
severe PS, monthly or bimonthly cardiac evaluations are advised,
focusing on RV function. In severely symptomatic PS, which is unresponsive to medical therapy and bed rest, percutaneous valvuloplasty
can be appropriate.

4.3.7 Congenital aortic stenosis
AS, aortic dilatation, and bicuspid aortic disease are discussed in sec
tions 5 and 6.

4.3.8 Tetralogy of Fallot

4.3.8.1 Maternal risk

Women with repaired tetralogy of Fallot usually tolerate pregnancy
well (WHO risk class II). Cardiac complications have been reported
in 8% of repaired patients, especially in those taking cardiac medication prior to pregnancy. [151] Arrhythmias and HF are the most common complications. Thrombo-embolism and endocarditis are rarer.
Dysfunction of the RV and/or moderate to severe pulmonary regurgitation are risk factors. Previous pregnancy may be associated with a
persisting increase in RV size and long-term cardiac events.

4.3.8.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
The risk of offspring complications is increased, in particular foetal
growth restriction. [152] Maternal screening for 22q11 deletion should
be undertaken prior to pregnancy.

4.3.8.3 Management
Follow-up every trimester is sufficient in most patients. In women
with severe pulmonary regurgitation, monthly or bimonthly cardiac
evaluation is indicated. If RV failure occurs during pregnancy, treatment with diuretics should be started and bed rest advised. Early
delivery or, rarely, transcatheter valve implantation could be considered in those who do not respond to conservative treatment.

4.3.9 Ebstein’s anomaly

4.3.9.1 Maternal risk

In women with uncomplicated Ebstein’s anomaly, pregnancy is often
tolerated well (WHO risk class II). Symptomatic patients with cyanosis and/or HF should be counselled against pregnancy. The haemodynamic problems seen largely depend on the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation (TR) and on RV function. Cyanosis (due to ASD/patent
foramen ovale) and arrhythmias due to accessory pathways are common. There is also an increased risk of HF and pre-term delivery. [153]

4.3.9.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
Foetal and neonatal outcomes are related to maternal oxygen saturation and CO. . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


4.3.9.3 Management
Even severe TR with HF can usually be managed medically during
pregnancy. Women with interatrial shunting can develop progressive
cyanosis during pregnancy and be at increased risk of paradoxical

emboli, and these should be assessed at each visit.

4.3.10 Transposition of the great arteries

4.3.10.1 Maternal risk

In patients with transposition of the great arteries (TGA), the risks
associated with pregnancy are mainly attributable to women with a
previous atrial (Senning and Mustard) switch, not an arterial switch.
Though many women with an atrial switch operation tolerate pregnancy relatively well, there is an increased risk of developing arrhythmias (sometimes life-threatening) and HF (WHO risk class III). An
irreversible decline in RV function and worsening TR are also
described. [154][,][155] Patients with more than moderate impairment of
RV function or greater than moderate TR should be advised against

pregnancy.

4.3.10.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
The risk of low birth weight and pre-term delivery is 38%.

4.3.10.3 Management
Monthly or bimonthly review focusing on systemic RV function and
arrhythmia is required. Diuretics and other HF therapies may be
required.

4.3.10.4 Arterial switch operation
The risk of pregnancy seems low in these patients with good clinical
condition pre-pregnancy and preserved ventricular function.
Women with a dilated neo-aorta will require closer surveillance.
Although this is now the most common operation for TGA, few data
are available on pregnancy outcomes.

4.3.11 Congenitally corrected transposition of the great

arteries

4.3.11.1 Maternal risk

In patients with congenitally corrected TGA (also called AV and ventriculoarterial discordance) risk depends on functional status, ventricular function, and the presence of arrhythmias and associated lesions
(such as a VSD and pulmonary valve stenosis). Complications include
arrhythmias and HF (WHO risk class III). These patients are also predisposed to developing AV block. Some 10% of patients have an irreversible decline in RV function. [148][,][156] Patients in New York Heart

Association (NYHA) classes III or IV, with ventricular dysfunction

[ejection fraction (EF) <40%], or severe TR should be counselled

against pregnancy.

4.3.11.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
The rate of foetal loss is increased, especially if there is cyanosis.

4.3.11.3 Management
For follow-up, it is recommended that patients have frequent echo
surveillance of systemic RV function (every 4–8 weeks) and assessment of symptoms and rhythm.


4.3.6.2 Obstetric and offspring risk

There is no evidence of increased obstetric risks.


4.3.6.3 Management
Mild and moderate PS are low-risk lesions (WHO risk classes I and II)
and two or three follow-up sessions are sufficient. In patients with
severe PS, monthly or bimonthly cardiac evaluations are advised,
focusing on RV function. In severely symptomatic PS, which is unresponsive to medical therapy and bed rest, percutaneous valvuloplasty
can be appropriate.

tion and CO.

3186 ESC Guidelines


4.3.12 Fontan circulation

4.3.12.1 Maternal risk

Patients with a Fontan circulation have an increased risk of fertility
issues, but successful pregnancy can occur. However, these are highto very high-risk pregnancies (WHO risk class III or IV). Atrial arrhyth
mias and NYHA class deterioration are not uncommon. Patients with

saturations <85%, depressed ventricular function, moderate to severe
AV regurgitation, refractory arrhythmia, or protein-losing enteropathy
should be counselled against pregnancy (mWHO IV).

4.3.12.2. Obstetric and offspring risk
Fontan patients have a high-risk of miscarriage (30%). [157] Antenatal
and peripartum bleeding is common. [158] There is an increased risk of
premature birth, small for gestational age, and neonatal death. [159]

4.3.12.3 Management
It is recommended that Fontan patients have frequent surveillance
during pregnancy (monthly) and in the first weeks after delivery.
Fontan patients are at risk of thrombo-embolic complications and
therapeutic anticoagulation should be considered (balanced with the
risk of bleeding). Atrial arrhythmias should be treated promptly and
this often requires electrical cardioversion.

### 5. Aortic diseases

Several heritable disorders affect the thoracic aorta, predisposing
patients to both aneurysm formation and aortic dissection. These
include HTAD and either syndromic (Marfan syndrome,
Loeys–Dietz syndrome, osteoaneurysm syndrome, and vascular
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome) or non-syndromic HTAD (i.e. only
aortic aneurysm). New genes are regularly discovered. Other
forms of congenital heart disease (e.g. tetralogy of Fallot and CoA)
may also be accompanied by aortic dilatation, and finally nonheritable aortic pathology may occur. [160] Risk factors for aortic
dilatation are hypertension and advanced maternal age. Pregnancy
is a high-risk period for all patients with aortic pathology, which is
rare during pregnancy but associated with very high mortality. [161][,][162] Most deaths occur in women not previously known to
have an aortopathy. Most of these women will have heritable disease, so autopsy tissue should be saved for DNA analysis and families offered referrals for screening. Guidelines for the diagnosis
and management of patients with thoracic aortic disease have
been published. [163][,][164] The current background information
and detailed discussion of the data for the following section of

[these Guidelines can be found in ESC CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0689)

ESC Guidelines 3187


5.1 Maternal and offspring risk
Haemodynamic and hormonal changes during pregnancy increase
the susceptibility to dissection. [165] Dissection occurs most often in
the last trimester of pregnancy (50%) or the early post-partum
period (33%). All women with a genetically proven syndrome or
familial aortic pathology should have counselling on the risk of dissection and the recurrence risk, and have a complete evaluation
including imaging of the entire aorta before pregnancy (see section
3). When assessing aortic diameters, body surface area should be
considered, especially in women of small stature. Parity seems
associated with increased aortic diameter. [166] The effect of pregnancy on aortic dilatation is not clear. [167][,][168] The diagnosis of
aortic dissection should be considered in all patients with chest
pain during pregnancy.

5.2 Specific syndromes
Marfan syndrome is thought to affect 1 in 5000 individuals. Although
bicuspid aortic valve is more common (1–2% of the population),
associated aortic complications are uncommon, accounting for only
6% of type A dissections during pregnancy. [169]

5.2.1 Marfan syndrome
The overall risk of a woman with Marfan syndrome having an aortic
dissection associated with pregnancy is �3%. [170] Aortic size is a major

determinant of risk, but even women with an aortic root <40 mm
have a risk of dissection of 1%. [170][,][171] Although there are limited data,
pregnancy should be avoided in Marfan patients with an aortic root

diameter >45 mm as there is an increased risk of dissection. When

the aorta is 40–45 mm, other factors should be considered, such as
family history of dissection and rate of aortic growth. [163] Distal aortic

dissection and dissection of other vessels are also a risk. For this rea
son, even after successful aortic root replacement, patients remain at
risk of further events. [172] Studies focusing on the potential growth
during pregnancy in Marfan patients demonstrated contradicting
results; some demonstrated no significant growth, while others demonstrated growth >_3 mm with a partial diameter decrease postpartum. [167][,][168][,][173]

Other important cardiac complications include progressive
mitral regurgitation (MR) due to mitral valve prolapse, new
arrhythmia, and HF due to ventricular dysfunction. [174][,][175]

Obstetric complications are also increased, including premature
rupture of membranes. [19]

5.2.2 Bicuspid aortic valve
Aortic dilatation occurs in <_50% of patients with a bicuspid aortic

valve and can occur even when valve function is normal. The dilata
tion can be in the distal ascending aorta, which cannot be adequately
visualized by echocardiography. If not visible with echocardiography,
MRI or CT should be performed pre-pregnancy. The risk of dissec

morphology, aortic dilatation, and CoA. [176] Pregnancy should be

avoided when the aorta diameter is >50 mm.

5.2.3 Vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome
Serious vascular complications occur almost exclusively in type IV
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (vascular). Maternal mortality is significant, and relates to uterine rupture and dissection of major
arteries and veins. Pregnancy is therefore considered as a very
high-risk undertaking and not advised. [177] These women should be
engaged in a shared decision-making process when contemplating

pregnancy.

5.2.4 Turner syndrome
Turner syndrome is associated with an increased risk of congenital
heart disease, aortic dilatation, hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerotic events. [178] Aortic dissection occurs rarely in Turner syndrome, but it is six times more common at younger ages than in the
general population [179] Risk factors for aortic dissection include aortic
dilation, bicuspid aortic valve, and CoA. [20][,][180] Pregnancy should be
avoided when the aortic size index is >25 mm/m [2] . Also, after aortic

root surgery, the patient remains at risk of type B dissection.

Spontaneous pregnancy can occur in mosaic Turner patients
(0.5–10%), but pregnancy is now most commonly secondary to
assisted fertility techniques. Cardiovascular evaluation is recommended before starting fertility treatment. Good BP control and diabetes management is mandatory for all Turner patients, especially
during pregnancy. [178]

5.2.5 Other autosomal dominant aortopathies
With improved genotyping, a series of new aortopathies are being
reported. These includes syndromic and non-syndromic HTAD.
These conditions are considered high-risk, especially when the aorta
is dilated, and may also have multisystem involvement with additional
risks such as uterine rupture. [181][–][184]

5.3 Management
5.3.1 Follow-up and medical therapy
Depending on the aortic diameter, patients with aortic pathology
should be monitored by echocardiography at regular intervals throughout the pregnancy and 6 months post-partum. In women with a highrisk of dissection or an already severely dilated aorta, monitoring every
month is warranted, while in low-risk women with only a mildly dilated
aorta, monitoring every 12 weeks seems reasonable. When needed,
cardiac MRI without contrast can be used. Pregnancy should be supervised by a cardiologist and obstetrician who are alert to the possible
complications. Strict BP control is advised, and antihypertensive treatment that is safe for the foetus should be initiated if necessary. [185] In
women with HTAD, beta-blocker therapy throughout pregnancy
should be considered. In patients with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type
IV, celiprolol is recommended (also in normotensive women) because
of the very high-risk of dissections and the benefit demonstrated in

bicuspid aortic valve is more common (1–2% of the population),
associated aortic complications are uncommon, accounting for only

dissection associated with pregnancy is �3%. [170] Aortic size is a major

determinant of risk, but even women with an aortic root <40 mm
have a risk of dissection of 1%. [170][,][171] Although there are limited data,

Other important cardiac complications include progressive
mitral regurgitation (MR) due to mitral valve prolapse, new
arrhythmia, and HF due to ventricular dysfunction. [174][,][175]

Obstetric complications are also increased, including premature
rupture of membranes. [19]


5.2.2 Bicuspid aortic valve
Aortic dilatation occurs in <_50% of patients with a bicuspid aortic

valve and can occur even when valve function is normal. The dilata
tion can be in the distal ascending aorta, which cannot be adequately
visualized by echocardiography. If not visible with echocardiography,
MRI or CT should be performed pre-pregnancy. The risk of dissection is small. Risk factors are the type of bicuspid aortic valve

3188 ESC Guidelines


non-pregnant patients. [186] Foetal growth should be monitored when
the mother is taking beta-blockers.

5.3.2 Interventions

When progressive dilatation occurs during pregnancy, before the
foetus is viable, surgical treatment with the foetus in utero should be
considered. When the foetus is viable, caesarean delivery followed
directly by aortic surgery is recommended (section 3). Caesarean
section should be performed in a hospital in which cardiothoracic
surgery and neonatal intensive care facilities are available.
In patients with acute aortic complications during pregnancy, management includes medical therapy where appropriate, and surgical or

catheter-based interventions where needed.

Stanford type A aortic dissection occurring during pregnancy is a
surgical emergency. Experienced cardiothoracic, cardiology, obstetric,
and cardio-anaesthetic physicians must act rapidly to deliver the foetus
(if viable) by caesarean section in a specialized cardiothoracic centre
and proceed directly to repair of the dissection. If the baby is not viable,
aortic surgery with the foetus in place should be performed. Although
maternal outcome is good, foetal mortality is 20–30%. [187]

In the case of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection, conservative
treatment with strict BP control using medication allowed during
pregnancy is recommended. [188] . [....................................................................]




Thoracic endovascular aortic repair has recently been proposed as
a new approach for complicated type B aortic dissection. Promising
mid-term outcomes have been reported. [189] However, the outcome
of thoracic endovascular aortic repair during pregnancy is only
described in a few cases, [190] and it is not recommended in the case of
genetic aortopathy. [191][–][193]

5.3.3 Delivery
The primary aim of intrapartum management in patients with ascending aorta enlargement is to reduce the cardiovascular stress of labour
and delivery. If the woman is taking beta-blockers during pregnancy,
they should be continued in the peripartum period.
If the ascending aorta diameter is 40–45 mm, vaginal delivery with
expedited second-stage and regional anaesthesia should be considered to prevent BP peaks, which may induce dissection. Caesarean
delivery may also be considered in these patients, based on the individual situation. Caesarean delivery should be considered when the
aortic diameter exceeds 45 mm, and is recommended in patients
with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type IV or acute or chronic

aortic dissection.

Table 5 provides an overview of the specific aortic disease
syndromes.

3190 ESC Guidelines

### 6. Valvular heart disease

At childbearing age, valvular heart disease is often due to rheumatic
heart disease, particularly in low–middle-income countries. Mechanical
valve prostheses raise specific problems during pregnancy. [92][,][195][,][196] Risk
assessment and management need to consider the resources available
in high- and low–middle-income countries. The current background information and detailed discussion of the data for the following

[section of these Guidelines can be found in ESC CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0690)

6.1 Stenotic valve lesions

In stenotic valve diseases, increased CO causes an increase in trans
valvular gradient of �50%, mainly between the first and second
trimesters, [197] which increases the risk of maternal and foetal
complications. [29][,][42][,][198]

6.1.1 Mitral stenosis

6.1.1.1 Maternal risk
Mild mitral stenosis (MS) is generally well tolerated. [198][,][199] HF occurs in
one-third of pregnant women with a valve area <_1.0 cm [2] and in onehalf of those with a valve area <_1.5 cm [2], [199] most often during the second trimester, even in the absence of symptoms before pregnancy. [198]

Sustained AF, although rare (<10%), may precipitate HF and thromboembolic events. [199][,][200] Mortality is between 0–3% in western
countries [198][–][200] and higher in low–middle-income countries. [201][,][202]

NYHA class >_ II, systolic PAP >30 mmHg, severe stenosis, and older
age are associated with maternal complications. [199]

6.1.1.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
The risk of acute HF peripartum depends on symptoms and PAP. [194]

Prematurity rates are 20–30%, intrauterine growth retardation
5–20%, and foetal death 1–5%. [198][–][200][,][203] Offspring risk is higher in
women in NYHA class III/IV during pregnancy. [29][,][194]

6.1.1.3 Management

Diagnosis. MS is considered clinically significant if valve area is <_1.5
cm [2] . [204][,][205] The reference measurement of MS severity is planimetry;
Doppler-derived pressure half-time is less reliable but can be used
during pregnancy. [204][,][205] Mean gradient and PAP assess haemodynamic
consequences and prognosis. [204][,][205] The assessment of mitral anatomy
and associated regurgitation is important when percutaneous mitral
commissurotomy is considered. [204][,][205] Before pregnancy, exercise
testing is useful to assess objective exercise tolerance and exercise
echocardiography may provide additional information.

Medical therapy. When symptoms or clinically significant PH (echocardiographically estimated systolic PAP >_50 mmHg) develop, activity
should be restricted and beta-1-selective blockers (preferably metoprolol or bisoprolol) commenced. [5] Diuretics may be used if symptoms
persist, avoiding high doses (see table ‘Recommendations for drug use
in pregnancy’). [5] Anticoagulation using UFH, LMWH, or vitamin K antagonist (VKA), according to the context and term, is recommended in
the case of paroxysmal or permanent AF, left atrial thrombosis, or prior
embolism. [5] Anticoagulation should be considered in women in sinus
rhythm with significant MS and spontaneous echocardiographic con
[2] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Interventions. All patients with significant MS should be counselled
against pregnancy and intervention should be considered prepregnancy, favouring percutaneous intervention, even if asymptomatic, and even more so if the valve area is <1.0 cm [2] . [198,204]

During pregnancy, percutaneous mitral commissurotomy is preferably performed after 20 weeks of gestation. It should only be considered
in women with NYHA class III/IV and/or systolic PAP >_50 mmHg,
despite optimal medical treatment in the absence of contraindications
(see table ‘General Recommendations’). [204] Closed commissurotomy

remains an alternative in low–middle-income countries. Due to foetal

risk, open-heart surgery should be reserved for cases in which all other
measures have failed and the mother’s life is threatened. [206]

Follow-up during pregnancy. Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up
is indicated monthly or bimonthly depending on haemodynamic tolerance. In mild MS, evaluation is recommended every trimester and
prior to delivery.

Labour and delivery. Vaginal delivery should be favoured in patients
with mild MS, and in patients with significant MS in NYHA class I/II
without PH. Caesarean section is generally considered in patients
who are in NYHA class III/IV or have PH, or in whom percutaneous
mitral commissurotomy cannot be performed or has failed.

Follow-up and prognosis after delivery. Close monitoring is needed in
the days following delivery. Late prognosis depends mainly on the
risk of stenosis progression or re-stenosis after commissurotomy,
and justifies regular follow-up. [204]

6.1.2 Valvular aortic stenosis

The main cause of AS is bicuspid aortic valve followed by rheumatic

heart disease.

6.1.2.1 Maternal risk

Cardiac morbidity is related to the baseline severity of AS and symptoms. [207] HF is rare (<10%) in women with moderate AS and in those
who were asymptomatic before pregnancy, while it occurs in one
out of four symptomatic patients. [207] Even in patients with severe AS,
pregnancy is often well tolerated if prior exercise tolerance was normal. Mortality is now rare if careful management is
provided. [194][,][198][,][207][–][209] Arrhythmias are rare. [206] Women with bicuspid aortic valve have a low-risk of aortic dissection if the aortic diameter is <50 mm (section 5.2).

6.1.2.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
Obstetric complications may be increased in patients with severe
AS. [207][,][209] Pre-term birth, intrauterine growth retardation, and low
birth weight occur in 20–25% of the offspring of mothers with moderate and severe AS, and are increased in severe AS. [207] Miscarriages
and foetal death rates are <5%. The risk of genetic transmission of LV
outflow tract malformations justifies the performance of foetal echocardiography in AS due to bicuspid aortic valve. [5]

6.1.2.3 Management

Diagnosis. The severity of AS is assessed by combining flowdependent indices and valve area. [204][,][205] Exercise testing is recommended in asymptomatic patients before pregnancy to evaluate


At childbearing age, valvular heart disease is often due to rheumatic
heart disease, particularly in low–middle-income countries. Mechanical
valve prostheses raise specific problems during pregnancy. [92][,][195][,][196] Risk
assessment and management need to consider the resources available
in high- and low–middle-income countries. The current background information and detailed discussion of the data for the following

[section of these Guidelines can be found in ESC CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0690)


6.1 Stenotic valve lesions

In stenotic valve diseases, increased CO causes an increase in trans
valvular gradient of �50%, mainly between the first and second
trimesters, [197] which increases the risk of maternal and foetal
complications. [29][,][42][,][198]


6.1.1 Mitral stenosis

6.1.1.1 Maternal risk
Mild mitral stenosis (MS) is generally well tolerated. [198][,][199] HF occurs in
one-third of pregnant women with a valve area <_1.0 cm [2] and in onehalf of those with a valve area <_1.5 cm [2], [199] most often during the second trimester, even in the absence of symptoms before pregnancy. [198]

Sustained AF, although rare (<10%), may precipitate HF and thromboembolic events. [199][,][200] Mortality is between 0–3% in western
countries [198][–][200] and higher in low–middle-income countries. [201][,][202]

NYHA class >_ II, systolic PAP >30 mmHg, severe stenosis, and older
age are associated with maternal complications. [199]


6.1.1.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
The risk of acute HF peripartum depends on symptoms and PAP. [194]

Prematurity rates are 20–30%, intrauterine growth retardation
5–20%, and foetal death 1–5%. [198][–][200][,][203] Offspring risk is higher in
women in NYHA class III/IV during pregnancy. [29][,][194]


6.1.1.3 Management


Diagnosis. MS is considered clinically significant if valve area is <_1.5
cm [2] . [204][,][205] The reference measurement of MS severity is planimetry;
Doppler-derived pressure half-time is less reliable but can be used
during pregnancy. [204][,][205] Mean gradient and PAP assess haemodynamic
consequences and prognosis. [204][,][205] The assessment of mitral anatomy
and associated regurgitation is important when percutaneous mitral
commissurotomy is considered. [204][,][205] Before pregnancy, exercise
testing is useful to assess objective exercise tolerance and exercise
echocardiography may provide additional information.


Medical therapy. When symptoms or clinically significant PH (echocardiographically estimated systolic PAP >_50 mmHg) develop, activity
should be restricted and beta-1-selective blockers (preferably metoprolol or bisoprolol) commenced. [5] Diuretics may be used if symptoms
persist, avoiding high doses (see table ‘Recommendations for drug use
in pregnancy’). [5] Anticoagulation using UFH, LMWH, or vitamin K antagonist (VKA), according to the context and term, is recommended in
the case of paroxysmal or permanent AF, left atrial thrombosis, or prior
embolism. [5] Anticoagulation should be considered in women in sinus
rhythm with significant MS and spontaneous echocardiographic contrast in the left atrium, large left atrium (>_ 60 mL/m [2] ), or congestive HF.

ESC Guidelines 3191


exercise tolerance, BP response, and arrhythmias, and exercise echocardiography may provide additional information. In women with
bicuspid aortic valve, aortic diameters should be assessed before and
during pregnancy.

Medical therapy. Medical treatment and restricted activities are indicated if HF occurs during pregnancy. Diuretics can be administered
for congestive symptoms.

Interventions. All symptomatic patients with severe AS or asymptomatic
patients with impaired LV function or a pathological exercise test should
be counselled against pregnancy, and surgery should be performed prepregnancy. [10][,][204] Pregnancy should not be discouraged in asymptomatic
patients, even with severe AS, when LV size and function and the exercise test are normal (see table ‘General Recommendations’). There
should also be no recent progression of AS.

During pregnancy in patients who are severely symptomatic
despite medical therapy, percutaneous valvuloplasty can be undertaken by an experienced operator. [207] If this is not possible and
patients have life-threatening symptoms, valve replacement should
be considered after early delivery by caesarean section if this is an
option (see table ‘General Recommendations’). Given the foetal risk
of surgery, transcatheter aortic valve implantation is a promising
alternative, but experience during pregnancy is very limited.

Follow-up during pregnancy. Regular follow-up is required by an experienced team. In severe AS, monthly or bimonthly cardiac evaluations
including echocardiography are advised.

Labour and delivery. In severe symptomatic AS, caesarean delivery
should be preferred. An individual approach is recommended for
asymptomatic severe AS. In non-severe AS, vaginal delivery is

favoured.

Follow-up and prognosis after delivery. Disease progression is frequent
after delivery and requires close follow-up. [204][,][208][,][210]

6.2 Regurgitant lesions
6.2.1 Mitral and aortic regurgitation
Mitral and aortic regurgitation can be of rheumatic, congenital, or
degenerative origin. [92][,][199]

6.2.1.1 Maternal risk

Women with severe regurgitation and symptoms or compromised
LV function are at high-risk of HF. [194][,][199] HF occurs in 20–25% of
women with moderate or severe rheumatic MR. [199] Acute severe

regurgitation is poorly tolerated. In women with congenital heart disease, significant left AV valve regurgitation is associated with cardiac
complications during pregnancy. A persistent worsening of regurgitation may occur. [42]

6.2.1.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
No increased risk of obstetric complications has been reported.
Intrauterine growth retardation occurs in 5–10%, and other
offspring complications in <5%, of women with moderate or severe
MR. [199] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


6.2.1.3 Management

Diagnosis. Evaluation, preferably pre-conception, should include the
assessment of symptoms and comprehensive echocardiographic
evaluation of regurgitation severity, LV dimensions, and function. [204]

Ascending aortic diameters should be measured in women with
aortic regurgitation, especially in those with bicuspid valves.

Medical therapy. Symptoms of fluid overload can usually be managed
medically.

Interventions. Pre-pregnancy surgery favouring valve repair should be
performed according to guidelines. [204]

In acute severe regurgitation with therapy-refractory HF, surgery
is sometimes unavoidable during pregnancy. If the foetus is sufficiently
mature, delivery should be undertaken prior to cardiac surgery (see
table ‘General Recommendations’).

Follow-up during pregnancy. Follow-up is required every trimester in
mild/moderate regurgitation, and more often in severe regurgitation.

Labour and delivery. Vaginal delivery with epidural anaesthesia and
shortened second stage is advisable.

Follow-up and prognosis after delivery. The prognosis depends on the
regurgitation severity and its consequences on symptoms, LV size,

and function.

6.2.2 Tricuspid regurgitation
Secondary TR is more frequent than primary TR, which may be due
to endocarditis or Ebstein’s anomaly.
Maternal risk is usually determined by left-sided valve disease or PH.
However, maternal risk can be increased in severe symptomatic TR or
in women with RV dysfunction. [50] In women with congenital heart disease, moderate/severe AV valve regurgitation may be associated with
maternal cardiac complications, which are mainly arrhythmias. [42]

Even severe TR with HF can usually be managed conservatively
during pregnancy (see table ‘General Recommendations’). When surgery is necessary for left-sided valve lesions, additional tricuspid
repair is indicated in severe TR and should be considered in moderate TR with annular dilatation (>_ 40 mm). [204] In severe symptomatic
TR, repair should be considered pre-pregnancy.

6.3 Atrial fibrillation in native heart valve

disease

A high thrombo-embolic risk is associated with AF, particularly in
clinically significant MS. Immediate anticoagulation is required, using
LMWH at therapeutic doses in the first and last trimesters, and VKAs
with the usual target INRs or LMWH for the second trimester. NonVKA OACs are contraindicated throughout pregnancy. The choice
between cardioversion and rate control using digoxin or betablockers depends on the severity of the underlying valve disease and
the tolerance (see section 12).

6.4 Prosthetic valves

6.4.1 Choice of valve prosthesis
When implantation of a prosthetic valve is unavoidable in a woman
who wants to become pregnant in the future, valve selection is


Medical therapy. Medical treatment and restricted activities are indicated if HF occurs during pregnancy. Diuretics can be administered
for congestive symptoms.


Interventions. All symptomatic patients with severe AS or asymptomatic
patients with impaired LV function or a pathological exercise test should
be counselled against pregnancy, and surgery should be performed prepregnancy. [10][,][204] Pregnancy should not be discouraged in asymptomatic

6.2 Regurgitant lesions
6.2.1 Mitral and aortic regurgitation
Mitral and aortic regurgitation can be of rheumatic, congenital, or
degenerative origin. [92][,][199]


6.2.1.1 Maternal risk

Women with severe regurgitation and symptoms or compromised
LV function are at high-risk of HF. [194][,][199] HF occurs in 20–25% of

Intrauterine growth retardation occurs in 5–10%, and other
offspring complications in <5%, of women with moderate or severe

challenging. Mechanical valves offer excellent haemodynamic performance and long-term durability, but the need for anticoagulation
increases maternal and foetal mortality and morbidity, and the risk of
major cardiac events during pregnancy is much higher than with bioprosthetic valves. [196][,][211][,][212] However, bioprosthetic valves in young
women are associated with a high-risk of structural valve deterioration resulting in the risk of going through pregnancy with a dysfunctional valve, and eventually in the inevitable need for re-operation.
Transcatheter valve implantation (currently especially in pulmonary
valves) and the Ross procedure in aortic valve disease (pulmonary
autograft in the aortic position and pulmonary homograft) are alternative options to be considered. [5] Data on pregnancy after a Ross
procedure are scarce but indicate low-risk in the absence of aortic
dilatation. [213] A desire for pregnancy is a class IIa indication for a biological valve. [204] In young women who wish to become pregnant in
the future, the pregnancy heart team should be involved in the choice
of a specific prosthesis. The final choice should be made after extensive sharing of information and discussion with the patient.

6.4.2 Pregnancy risk with bioprostheses
The risk of maternal cardiovascular complications in women with a
bioprosthesis is low in those with no or minimal bioprosthesis dysfunction and uncompromised ventricular function. When significant
bioprosthesis dysfunction is present, the risk of complications can be
significant. Pre-pregnancy assessment and counselling, as well as
follow-up, medical treatment, and indications for intervention, are
comparable with those for pregnancies with native valve dysfunction.

6.5 Mechanical prostheses and
anticoagulation
In women with mechanical valves, pregnancy is associated with a very
high-risk of complications (WHO risk classification III). In the
ROPAC registry, the chances of an event-free pregnancy with a live
birth were 58% for women with a mechanical valve, compared with
79% for women with a bioprosthesis and 78% for women with heart
disease but no valve prosthesis. [196] A recent study from the UK
reported a favourable outcome for mother and baby in only 28% of
cases. [214] The main risks are related to the need for anticoagulation
therapy (valve thrombosis and haemorrhagic complications).
Additional risks are related to ventricular and valvular dysfunction.

6.5.1 Maternal risk

The risk of valve thrombosis is markedly increased during pregnancy.
The risk is lower with adequate dosing of anticoagulant therapy, and
depends on the type and position of the mechanical valve, and on
additional patient-related risk factors. [204] In the ROPAC registry, valve
thrombosis occurred in 4.7% of 202 pregnancies and mortality was
20%. [196] In the UK study, maternal mortality related to thrombotic
complications or valve dysfunction occurred in 9% and severe morbidity in 41% (16% thrombo-embolic complications). [214] The risk of
valve thrombosis is relatively low with VKAs throughout pregnancy
(0–4%). [196][,][215][–][219] Scarce evidence concerning UFH in the first trimester or throughout pregnancy indicates a high-risk of valve thrombosis (9–33%); additional risks are thrombocytopenia and
osteoporosis. [215][,][218][,][219] LMWH is also associated with the risk of
valve thrombosis. [196][,][214][,][215][,][219][–][222] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


markedly increases due to increased renal clearance, monitoring of
anti-Xa levels with dose adjustment decreases the risk. LMWH
throughout pregnancy with anti-Xa monitoring and dose adjustment
according to peak levels carries a valve thrombosis risk of
4.4–8.7%. [219][,][223] Suboptimal target anti-Xa levels or poor compliance

often contribute to valve thrombosis, but several valve thromboses

occured with peak anti-Xa levels within the target range of 1.0–1.2
IU/mL. [221][,][222] Valve thrombosis occurs in 5.8–7.4% when LMWH is

used in the first trimester only, which is similar to using LMWH
throughout pregnancy. [196][,][215][,][219][,][223] However, the high-risk of valve
thrombosis in the UK study was mainly related to the use of LMWH
throughout pregnancy. The occurrence of valve thrombosis with
adequate peak anti-Xa levels has raised concerns about the safety of
this approach. Fast renal clearance can result in subtherapeutic
trough (pre-dose) anti-Xa levels despite adequate peak levels, but
data on pregnancies with LMWH dosing according to trough and
peak anti-Xa levels are limited to case reports. [5][,][224][–][226] In conclusion,
there are unresolved questions concerning LMWH in pregnant
women with mechanical valves, including optimal anti-Xa levels, the
importance of peak vs. trough levels, the best time intervals for antiXa monitoring, and the duration of use.

Current evidence (lacking adequate randomized studies) indicates
that the use of VKAs throughout pregnancy, under strict INR control,
is the safest regimen to prevent valve thrombosis. [196][,][215][–][219] LMWH is
possibly superior to UFH for preventing valve thrombosis. [196][,][219][,][223]

6.5.2 Obstetric and offspring risk
All anticoagulation regimens carry an increased risk of miscarriage
and haemorrhagic complications, including post-partum haemorrhage and retroplacental bleeding leading to premature birth and foetal death. [196][,][216][,][218][,][220][,][221] ROPAC shows that VKAs during the first
trimester are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage compared with LMWH or UFH (28.6% vs. 9.2%), and the live birth rate is
lower, in line with other literature. [196] Two systematic reviews concluded that the risk of foetal loss is dose-related (foetal loss rate with

low-dose VKA is 13.4–19.2%, total foetal loss rate with VKA is

32.5%). Foetal loss rate with a combined heparin/VKA regimen is
22.7%,and with LMWH throughout pregnancy is 12.2%. [217][,][219]

Comparison between studies is hampered by reporting differences,
and conclusions concerning the safety of low-dose VKA are controversial. [5][,][196][,][217][,][219][,][223][,][227] VKA use in the first trimester results in

embryopathy (limb defects, nasal hypoplasia) in 0.6–10% of
cases. [216][,][218][,][219][,][228] UFH and LMWH do not cross the placenta, there
fore substitution of VKA with UFH or LMWH in weeks 6–12 almost

eliminates the risk of embryopathy. The embryopathy risk is also
dose-dependent (0.45–0.9% with low-dose warfarin). [217][,][219]

Additionally, there is 0.7–2% risk of foetopathy (e.g. ocular and central nervous system abnormalities, intracranial haemorrhage) with
VKAs in the second and third trimester. [216][,][219][,][223][,][228][–][230] Foetopathy
has been described with UFH but not with LMWH throughout pregnancy. [219][,][223] Vaginal delivery while the mother is on VKAs is contraindicated because of the risk of foetal intracranial bleeding. [228]

Haemorrhagic complications in the mother occur with all regimens,
but the incidence is lower with VKA throughout pregnancy than with
LMWH/UFH throughout pregnancy. [219] Addition of low-dose aspirin
to VKA or heparin has no proven advantage in preventing valve


6.4.2 Pregnancy risk with bioprostheses
The risk of maternal cardiovascular complications in women with a
bioprosthesis is low in those with no or minimal bioprosthesis dysfunction and uncompromised ventricular function. When significant
bioprosthesis dysfunction is present, the risk of complications can be
significant. Pre-pregnancy assessment and counselling, as well as
follow-up, medical treatment, and indications for intervention, are
comparable with those for pregnancies with native valve dysfunction.


6.5 Mechanical prostheses and
anticoagulation
In women with mechanical valves, pregnancy is associated with a very
high-risk of complications (WHO risk classification III). In the
ROPAC registry, the chances of an event-free pregnancy with a live
birth were 58% for women with a mechanical valve, compared with
79% for women with a bioprosthesis and 78% for women with heart
disease but no valve prosthesis. [196] A recent study from the UK
reported a favourable outcome for mother and baby in only 28% of
cases. [214] The main risks are related to the need for anticoagulation
therapy (valve thrombosis and haemorrhagic complications).
Additional risks are related to ventricular and valvular dysfunction.

The risk is lower with adequate dosing of anticoagulant therapy, and
depends on the type and position of the mechanical valve, and on
additional patient-related risk factors. [204] In the ROPAC registry, valve
thrombosis occurred in 4.7% of 202 pregnancies and mortality was

osteoporosis. [215][,][218][,][219] LMWH is also associated with the risk of
valve thrombosis. [196][,][214][,][215][,][219][–][222] Because the dose requirement

thrombosis but is associated with significantly more maternal bleeding complications, including fatal events. [196][,][219][,][222]

6.5.3 Management
Pre-pregnancy evaluation should include the assessment of symptoms
and echocardiographic evaluation of ventricular function, as well as
prosthetic and native valve function. The type and position of valve(s),
as well as the history of valve thrombosis, should be taken into account.
The option to avoid pregnancy should be discussed with the mother.

6.5.3.1 Medical therapy
The advantages and disadvantages of different anticoagulation regimen
should be discussed extensively before pregnancy. The mother must
understand that the use of VKAs is the most effective regimen to prevent valve thrombosis, and therefore the safest regimen for her, and that
risks to the mother also jeopardize the baby. However, the increased
risks of embryopathy, foetopathy, foetal loss, and foetal haemorrhage
associated with the use of VKAs need to be discussed while considering
the VKA dose. The higher risk of valve thrombosis and lower foetal risks

risks to the mother also jeopardize the baby. However, the increased
risks of embryopathy, foetopathy, foetal loss, and foetal haemorrhage
associated with the use of VKAs need to be discussed while considering
the VKA dose. The higher risk of valve thrombosis and lower foetal risks
associated with LMWH should be discussed. Compliance with prior


anticoagulant therapy should be considered. The mother should understand that whatever anticoagulation regime is chosen, her strict compliance is crucial for a successful outcome of the pregnancy.
VKAs should be continued until pregnancy is achieved. Continuation
of VKAs throughout pregnancy should be considered when the VKA
dose is low (see Table 7). Because of the low risks of embryopathy, foetopathy (<2%), and foetal loss (<20%), VKAs are the most effective regimen to prevent valve thrombosis. [215][,][218][,][219] The target INR should be
chosen according to current guidelines, [204] with INR monitoring weekly
or every 2 weeks. Self-monitoring of INR in suitable patients is recommended. Alternatively, a switch to LMWH from weeks 6–12 under
strict monitoring may be considered in patients with a low dose requirement, after full information has been given to the mother. When a
higher dose of VKAs is required, discontinuation of VKAs between
weeks 6 and 12, and replacement with adjusted-dose i.v. UFH or
LMWH twice daily with dose adjustment according to peak anti-Xa levels, should be considered. See table ‘Recommendations for the management of prosthetic heart valves’ and Figures 2–4 for details of dosing and
monitoring. Alternatively, continuation of VKAs may be considered in
these patients after fully informed consent. In addition to monitoring


3194 ESC Guidelines


peak anti-Xa levels, monitoring of the trough (pre-dose) anti-Xa level
and dose-adjustment to maintain this trough level at >_0.6 IU/mL may be
considered based on theoretical grounds, despite limited evidence. [5][,][224][,][225] The starting dose for LMWH is 1 mg/kg body weight for
enoxaparin and 100 IU/kg for dalteparin, twice daily subcutaneously.
The dose should be adjusted daily according to peak (or peak and
trough) anti-Xa levels and weekly when the target anti-Xa level is
achieved. [5][,][224][,][225] The routine addition of acetylsalicylic acid is not recommended. [196][,][219][,][222] When UFH is used, after a stable aPTT has

been achieved, UFH should be monitored weekly using aPTT, with a
prolongation of >_2 times the control. During the second and third
trimester, VKAs are the favoured therapy. For details on management
see Figures 2–4.

6.5.3.2 Surveillance during pregnancy
These high-risk pregnancies should be managed by a pregnancy heart
team in an expert centre. The effectiveness of the anticoagulation
regimen should be monitored weekly or every 2 weeks depending
on the anticoagulation regimen (see Table 7), and clinical follow-up
including echocardiography should be performed monthly.


ESC Guidelines 3195


6.5.3.3 Diagnosis and management of valve thrombosis
Dyspnoea and/or an embolic event are reasons for immediate transthoracic echocardiography to search for valve thrombosis, usually
followed by transoesophageal echocardiography. Additionally, fluoroscopy can be performed with limited foetal risk. Management of
valve thrombosis is comparable with management in non-pregnant
patients. This includes optimizing anticoagulation with i.v. UFH and
the resumption of oral anticoagulation in non-critically ill patients
with recent subtherapeutic anticoagulation, and surgery when anticoagulation fails and for critically ill patients with obstructive thrombosis. [204] A molecular weight >1000 Da prevents most fibrinolytic items
from easily crossing the placenta, though small amounts of streptokinase and fragments of urokinase may pass into the foetal circulation.
Alteplase (a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) has the highest molecular weight and does not cross the placenta. However, the
risk of embolization (10%) and subplacental bleeding is a concern,
and experience in pregnancy is limited. Fibrinolysis should be applied
in critically ill patients when surgery is not immediately available, and . [.....................................................]


it should be considered when the risk of surgery is high. [204] Because
foetal loss is high (30%) with surgery, fibrinolysis may be considered
instead of surgery in non-critically ill patients when anticoagulation
fails. [231] Fibrinolysis is the therapy of choice in right-sided prosthetic
valve thrombosis. [204] The mother should be informed about the risks.

6.5.3.4 Delivery
Planned delivery is necessary. Vaginal delivery requires a prior switch
to i.v. heparin. The use of epidural anaesthesia requires a prolonged
interruption of anticoagulant therapy, which may contraindicate its
use in women with a mechanical prosthesis. A planned caesarean section may therefore be considered as an alternative, especially in
patients with a high-risk of valve thrombosis, to keep the time without VKAs as short as possible. Caesarean section should be performed if labour onset occurs while the patient is still on VKAs.

### 7. Coronary artery disease

The incidence of CAD in women of childbearing age is unclear and
varies between countries. [232] Although acute MI (AMI)/acute coronary syndromes (ACS) complicating pregnancy is relatively uncommon (1.7–6.2/100 000 deliveries), [233][–][235] CAD accounts for >20% of
all maternal cardiac deaths. [3] The current background information
and detailed discussion of the data for the following section of these

[Guidelines can be found in ESC CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0691)

7.1 Aetiology
Pregnancy is associated with a three- to four-fold increase in AMI risk
compared with age-matched non-pregnant women. [232][,][234][,][236][,][237] Risk
factors include smoking, [238] maternal age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidaemia. [233][,][234][,][237][,][239][,][240] Additional risk factors include
(pre-)eclampsia, thrombophilia, transfusion, post-partum infection,
cocaine use, multiparity, and post-partum haemorrhage. [233][,][234] As the
birth rate in women >40 years increases, ACS complicating pregnancy
will become more common, as for every year increase in maternal age
there is a 20% increase in MI risk. [235] The aetiology of CAD in pregnancy
differs from the general population; the majority of CAD has nonatherosclerotic mechanisms, including pregnancy-related spontaneous
coronary artery dissection (P-SCAD) (43%), angiographically normal
coronary arteries (18%), and coronary thrombosis (17%). [239][,][241]

P-SCAD-related AMI occurs most commonly in late pregnancy/early
post-partum, and predominantly involves the left-sided coronaries, frequently with multivessel involvement. [237][,][239] Potential pregnancyrelated precipitating factors include fluctuating oestrogen/progesterone
levels resulting in structural changes in coronary vasculature, in background of fibromuscular dysplasia or connective tissue disease, and
increased coronary shear stresses associated with labour. [242][–][244]

The mechanisms of AMI with angiographically normal coronary
arteries remains unclear and include transient coronary spasm
(increased vascular reactivity and/or use of ergot derivatives), [237][,][245]

rather reflecting the limitations of this diagnostic technique. [246][,][247]

Coronary thrombosis in the absence of atherosclerosis is most likely
due to the hypercoagulability of pregnancy [248] and can result from
paradoxical embolization.

Increasing survival in Kawasaki disease (in the USA it is predicted
that by 2030, one in every 1600 adults will have suffered from
Kawasaki disease) presents an additional challenge. [249] Relevant
Kawasaki disease manifestations include aneurysms, coronary blood
flow alteration, coronary stenoses, myocardial ischaemia/fibrosis,
congestive cardiac failure, and valvular abnormalities. [249]

Coronary thrombosis in the absence of atherosclerosis is most
likely due to the hypercoagulability of pregnancy [248] and can result
from paradoxical embolization.

7.2 Presentation and diagnosis
Development of pregnancy-related ACS/AMI is most common during the third trimester [STEMI 25% and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) 32%]
or post-partum (STEMI 45% and NSTEMI 55%). Clinical presentation
is the same as in the non-pregnant population. [250][,][251] ECG interpretation can be challenging, with inverted T waves in the absence of coronary ischaemia, and anaesthesia induction for caesarean section
associated with ST-segment depression. [237] A serum troponin rise

[252][,][253] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Where the ECG is non-diagnostic, echocardiography may be helpful. [254] The main differential diagnoses include PE, aortic dissection,
and pre-eclampsia. Potential complications include HF/cardiogenic
shock (38%), arrhythmias (12%), recurrent angina/AMI (20%), maternal mortality (7%), and foetal death (7%). [239]

7.3 Management
AMI management in pregnancy is similar to that in the general population, including revascularization techniques. In P-SCAD, enhanced
vascular vulnerability should be considered when applying revascularization strategies. [241][,][255] Management should be multidisciplinary,
including emergency, obstetric, and cardiovascular teams, and any
revascularization should be undertaken by the most experienced
operator due to the attendant risks associated with coronary intervention in this patient population. In cardiogenic shock, there should
be facilities for emergency mechanical circulatory support. Close
monitoring of the mother and foetus is required, with a delivery strategy in place in case there is sudden maternal or foetal deterioration.
In the event of maternal cardiac arrest, resuscitation (and delivery)
should be performed according to existing guidelines. [256]

7.4 Pharmacotherapy
There is little information regarding the foetal safety of guidelinerecommended drug therapy in AMI. [257] Low-dose aspirin appears to
be safe, but there is little information regarding P2Y 12 inhibitors.
Clopidogrel should be used only when strictly necessary and for the
shortest duration. [239] In the absence of data regarding glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa inhibitors-bivalirudin, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, their use is not
recommended. Beta-blockade may be beneficial in reducing shear
stress in P-SCAD. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator does
not cross the placenta but may induce bleeding complications (subplacental bleeding). The benefits of short-term heparinization during
PCI probably outweigh the risk of bleeding complications.

7.5 Intervention

The effects of ionizing radiation should not prevent primary PCI in
pregnant patients with standard indications for revascularization in

AMI. However, the radiation dose must be minimized. In stable, lowrisk NSTEMI, a non-invasive approach should be considered. [258]

Although CT coronary angiography provides an alternative diagnostic
method, [259] it requires radiation, potentially high-dose beta-blockade,
and may fail to demonstrate limited P-SCAD.

7.5.1 Stent choice and antiplatelet therapy
The majority of reports regarding STEMI in pregnancy relate to baremetal stents. However, new-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) are
recommended according to the 2017 AMI STEMI Guidelines. [251]

Because no complications have been reported in stented pregnant
patients treated with clopidogrel and aspirin, and because pregnancy
is a high bleeding-risk situation, use of a more potent P2Y 12 inhibitor
should be considered with caution. The duration of dual antiplatelet
therapy with a second/third-generation DES can be shortened, particularly in the absence of great thrombotic burden. Bioabsorbable
stent usage has been reported in spontaneous coronary artery dissection; however, there is currently no evidence to recommend
them in pregnancy.


The incidence of CAD in women of childbearing age is unclear and
varies between countries. [232] Although acute MI (AMI)/acute coronary syndromes (ACS) complicating pregnancy is relatively uncommon (1.7–6.2/100 000 deliveries), [233][–][235] CAD accounts for >20% of

should suggest myocardial ischaemia, even in pre-eclampsia. [252][,][253]

3198 ESC Guidelines


7.6 Pre-existing CAD
Women with pre-established CAD or ACS/MI are at risk of serious
adverse cardiac events during pregnancy, the highest risk of which is
seen in atherosclerotic coronary disease [260] with reported maternal
mortality between 0–23%. [92][,][261][,][262] Adverse obstetric outcomes
occur in <_16%, with 30% of pregnancies complicated by an adverse
foetal/neonatal event, most commonly in coronary atherosclerosis
(50%). [260]

Pregnancy may be considered in patients with known CAD in the
absence of residual ischaemia and clinical signs of LV dysfunction.
There are no high-quality data defining how long pregnancy should
be delayed post-AMI/ACS. However, recommending 12 months
seems reasonable, individualized according to comorbidities, cardiovascular status, and the requirement for medical therapy. There is no
definitive evidence that previous P-SCAD increases recurrence risk.
However, avoidance of further pregnancy is advised [258] and, if the
patient chooses to proceed, close monitoring is recommended.

7.7 Labour and delivery
Timing of delivery must be individualized. However, treatment of
STEMI/NSTEMI should not be delayed for delivery. Delivery should be
postponed (if possible) for at least 2 weeks post-AMI to facilitate
maternal management. [237] Vaginal delivery is preferable (see section 3).

7.8 Recommendations

### 8. Cardiomyopathies and heart failure

The aetiology of pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy includes
acquired and inherited diseases, such PPCM, toxic cardiomyopathies,
HCM, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,
and storage diseases. Although rare, they may cause severe complications in pregnancy. [263] HF with preserved EF, an important cause of HF
in older patients, does not appear to be a major clinical problem in
pregnancy; however, it may be underdiagnosed. The current background information and detailed discussion of the data for the follow[ing section of these Guidelines can be found in ESC CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0693)

8.1 Peripartum cardiomyopathy
PPCM has recently been reviewed [32][,][263][,][264] and the EURObservational
Research Programme international PPCM registry will provide fundamental data on this condition. [265][,][266] Important predisposing factors
include multiparity, African ethnicity, smoking, diabetes, pre-eclampsia,
malnutrition, advanced age, and teenage pregnancy. [32][,][263] The cause is
uncertain, but potential aetiologies include inflammation and angiogenic
imbalance, inducing vascular damage. [267][–][270] The biologically active 16
kDa prolactin and other factors, such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase
1 (sFlt1), may initiate and drive PPCM. [268][,][271][,][272]

8.1.1 Diagnosis
PPCM presents with HF secondary to LV systolic dysfunction
towards the end of pregnancy and in the months following delivery,
with the majority diagnosed post-partum. Careful history taking is
necessary to identify and exclude other causes of HF. [273][–][276] The LV
may be non-dilated, but the EF is usually <45%. [32][,][263][,][270] Symptoms
and signs are often typical for HF with numerous phenotypes
reported. Patients frequently present with acute HF, but also with
ventricular arrhythmias and/or cardiac arrest. [277][–][280]

Echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice. Initial LVEF
<30%, marked LV dilatation (LV end-diastolic diameter >_6.0 cm), and
RV involvement are associated with adverse outcomes. [278][,][281][,][282]

8.1.2 Prognosis and counselling
Prospective larger cohort studies have mainly focused on 6 month
outcomes, reporting a mortality ranging from 2.0% in Germany [277] to
12.6% in a large cohort of 206 patients with PPCM from South
Africa. [283] A prospective study over 24 months from Turkey reported
a 24% mortality. [284] When the EF has not recovered to >50–55%,
subsequent pregnancy should be discouraged. Even with normalized
EF, counselling is required due to potential recurrence. With expert
interdisciplinary management and immediate bromocriptine treatment post-delivery, successful subsequent pregnancies, especially in
patients with recovered EF, have been reported. [285]

8.2 Dilated cardiomyopathy
DCM encompasses a number of conditions resulting in LV dilatation
and dysfunction including prior viral infection, drugs, and ischaemia.
Some 50% of cases are idiopathic, of which 20–35% are hereditary. [276] Around 40% of the genetic causes of DCM have been identified, with >50 gene mutations described. [286] The prevalence of
idiopathic DCM is 1:2500; however, this is likely an underestimate. [287]


Pregnancy may be considered in patients with known CAD in the
absence of residual ischaemia and clinical signs of LV dysfunction.
There are no high-quality data defining how long pregnancy should
be delayed post-AMI/ACS. However, recommending 12 months
seems reasonable, individualized according to comorbidities, cardiovascular status, and the requirement for medical therapy. There is no
definitive evidence that previous P-SCAD increases recurrence risk.
However, avoidance of further pregnancy is advised [258] and, if the
patient chooses to proceed, close monitoring is recommended.


7.7 Labour and delivery
Timing of delivery must be individualized. However, treatment of
STEMI/NSTEMI should not be delayed for delivery. Delivery should be
postponed (if possible) for at least 2 weeks post-AMI to facilitate
maternal management. [237] Vaginal delivery is preferable (see section 3).

ESC Guidelines 3199


Patients may already be known to have DCM, or may present de
novo during pregnancy. Distinguishing symptoms and signs of normal
pregnancy from HF demands careful attention. Although PPCM and
DCM are distinct disease entities, patients may share a genetic predisposition, and differentiation during pregnancy may be impossible. [273][–][276][,][287]

8.2.1 Prognosis and counselling
Pregnancy is poorly tolerated in some women with pre-existing
DCM, with the potential for significant deterioration in LV function. [29]

Predictors of maternal mortality are NYHA class III/IV and EF
<40%. [288] Highly adverse risk factors include EF <20%, MR, RV failure,
AF, and/or hypotension. All patients with DCM planning pregnancy
require appropriate counselling and joint multidisciplinary care, as
there is a high-risk of irreversible deterioration in ventricular function,
maternal mortality, and foetal loss.

Pre-pregnancy management includes the modification of existing
HF medications to avoid foetal harm. Angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin
receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonists (MRAs), and ivabradine are contraindicated and should be
stopped prior to conception, with close clinical and echocardiographic
monitoring. However, beta-blockers should be continued and
switched to beta-1-selective blockers (see section 12). If EF falls, then
further discussion should occur, reconsidering the safety of pregnancy. . [..........................................................................]


If contraindicated drugs have been inadvertently taken during the first
trimester, they should be stopped, and the patient monitored closely
with maternal echocardiography and foetal ultrasound.

8.3 Management of heart failure during
and after pregnancy
Assessment and management of pregnant patients with DCM or
PPCM depends upon the clinical setting. However, all require joint
cardiac and obstetric care, serial echocardiograms, serum B-type
natriuretic peptide, and foetal ultrasound. [46]

8.3.1 Acute/subacute heart failure and cardiogenic shock
during or after pregnancy
HF in DCM or PPCM can develop rapidly and Guidelines for the management of acute HF and cardiogenic shock apply. [286][,][289] For rapid
diagnosis and decision-making, a pre-specified management algorithm
and expert interdisciplinary team are crucial (Figures 5 and 6). [279][,][290]

8.3.1.1 Haemodynamic instability and cardiogenic shock
If a patient is in cardiogenic shock or dependent on inotropes or vasopressors, she should be transferred early to a facility where mechanical
circulatory support teams are available. [279][,][289] Urgent delivery by caesarean section (irrespective of gestation) should be considered with
mechanical circulatory support immediately available. PPCM patients


3200 ESC Guidelines


are sensitive to the toxic effects of beta-adrenergic agonists, which
should be avoided whenever possible. Levosimendan may be the preferred inotrope. [279][,][291][,][292]

8.3.1.2 Acute/subacute heart failure
Patients with symptoms and signs of acute HF should be evaluated
according to acute HF Guidelines. [289] Differential diagnoses include
uncomplicated pregnancy, pulmonary oedema (pre-eclampsia/
eclampsia), PE, pneumonia, and MI, all of which should be diagnosed
or excluded using standard algorithms.

Management goals are similar to non-pregnant acute HF, while avoiding foetotoxic agents (ACE inhibitors, ARB, ARNI, MRA, and atenolol).
HF with pulmonary congestion is treated with loop diuretics and

. [........................................]


thiazides if required; however, diuretics should be avoided in the
absence of pulmonary congestion, due to the potential reduction in placental blood flow. [290] Hydralazine and nitrates appear safe in pregnancy,
although with less evidence for benefit than ACE inhibitors, and should
only be used in the presence of hypertension, severe LV dysfunction,
and/or evidence of congestion in decompensated HF. Beta-blockers
should be initiated cautiously and gradually uptitrated to the maximum
tolerated dose [266][,][286] (details in section 12). High resting heart rate is a
predictor of adverse outcome in PPCM, and treatment with ivabradine
may be useful if the patient is not pregnant or breastfeeding. [283][,][293]

Relapse of PPCM has been observed after rapid tapering of HF therapies, and therefore treatment should continue for at least 6 months
after full recovery of LV function followed by gradual tapering. [264]

ESC Guidelines 3201


8.3.2 Bromocriptine and peripartum cardiomyopathy
Addition of bromocriptine to standard HF therapy may improve LV
recovery and clinical outcome in women with acute severe
PPCM. [24][,][25][,][277][,][278][,][294] Bromocriptine (2.5 mg once daily) for at least
1 week may be considered in uncomplicated cases, whereas prolonged
treatment (2.5 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, then 2.5 mg once daily for 6
weeks) may be considered in patients with EF <25% and/or cardiogenic
shock. Bromocriptine treatment must always be accompanied by anticoagulation with heparin (LMWH or UFH), at least in prophylactic dosages. [25][,][294][,][295] The essential therapies for patients with acute PPCM have
been summarized under the BOARD label: Bromocriptine, Oral heart
failure therapies, Anticoagulants, vasoRelaxing agents, and Diuretics. [296]

8.3.3 Devices and transplantation
Given the high rate of improvement of LV function during optimal HF
drug therapy, early implantation of an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) in patients with newly diagnosed PPCM or DCM is
not appropriate. A wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) may
prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD) during the first 3–6 months
after diagnosis, especially in patients with EF <35%, allowing protected recovery from severe LV impairment. [279][,][297] In severe LV dysfunction during the 6–12 months following first presentation despite
optimal medical therapy, implantation of an ICD and cardiac resynchronization therapy (for patients with left bundle branch block and
QRS >130ms) are recommended. [286][,][298] However, mortality reduction in those with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy is uncertain. [299]

Cardiac transplantation is reserved for patients where mechanical
circulatory support is not possible or desirable, or for patients who
do not recover after 6–12 months. Patients with PPCM have higher
rates of graft failure and death after heart transplantation. [300]

8.3.3.1 Pregnancy post-cardiac transplantation
Despite successful pregnancies post-cardiac transplantation, data are
limited. Multidisciplinary team management is required relating to the
timing and management of pregnancy. [301] Pre-conception counselling
includes the risks of graft rejection and dysfunction, infection, and the
teratogenicity of immunosuppressive agents. Some centres recommend human leucocyte antigen testing prior to conception. If the
donated heart and father have the same human leucocyte antigen,
and the recipient has donor-specific antigens, the risk of autograft
rejection is high. [302] PPCM recurrence rates in transplanted patients
are unknown. However, as rejection risk in these patients is higher in
the first year post-transplant and graft survival is shorter, many advise
against pregnancy in such patients. [303]

Pregnancy should be avoided for at least 1 year posttransplantation, and discouraged in patients at high-risk of rejection
and/or with poor baseline graft function before pregnancy. [303][–][305]

Besides graft rejection or dysfunction and infection, hypertension is
the most common maternal complication. Additional increased risks
include hyperemesis and thrombo-embolic disease. [301] All immunosuppressive medications enter the foetal circulation, thus the management of immunosuppression in the pregnant post-transplant
recipient is highly specialized. [301] As all immunosuppressive agents are
excreted into breast milk with unknown long-term effects, the
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation currently

[303] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


8.3.4 Anticoagulation
Standard indications for anticoagulation in PPCM and DCM apply
during and after pregnancy. The choice of anticoagulant agent
depends upon the stage of pregnancy and patient preference (see
section 12 and Table 7). [9][,][306] In PPCM patients with very low EF, prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered. [263]

8.3.5 Delivery and breastfeeding
Urgent delivery irrespective of gestation duration should be considered in women with advanced HF and haemodynamic instability
despite treatment. [279] Caesarean section is recommended with central neuraxial anaesthesia. To prevent abrupt pressure or volume
changes, epidural anaesthesia might be the method of choice but
should be carefully titrated, guided by an expert anaesthetic
team. [279][,][290] In stable congestive HF, vaginal delivery is preferred with
spinal/epidural analgesia.

In HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), breastfeeding is discouraged in
more severe cases (e.g. NYHA III/IV). Stopping lactation reduces the
high metabolic demand and enables early optimal HF treatment. [24]

For drug treatment during breastfeeding see section 12.

8.4 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
The true prevalence of HCM in different populations is a topic of
debate, but a number of methodologically diverse studies in North
America, Europe, Asia, and Africa have reported a prevalence of
unexplained increase in LV thickness in the range of 0.02–0.23% in
adults. [65] The observed incidence of HCM in pregnancy is
<1:1000. [65][,][307]

Women with HCM usually tolerate pregnancy well. In a recent
meta-analysis, maternal mortality was 0.5%, and complication or worsening of symptoms occurred in 29% of cases. Foetal mortality by
spontaneous abortion (15%), therapeutic abortion (5%), or stillbirth
(2%) is comparable to the general population; however, the risk of
premature birth is increased (26%). [308][,][309] Risk is increased where
women are symptomatic pre-pregnancy or exhibit a high-risk profile,
including diastolic dysfunction, severe LV outflow tract obstruction,
and arrhythmia. [310][,][311] Medication in the pre-pregnancy period, and a
CARPREG or ZAHARA score >_1, are risk factors for pregnancy/
post-partum cardiac events. [312] Symptoms are typical for HF with pulmonary congestion and echocardiography is usually diagnostic.

8.4.1 Management

Women in WHO class II should be assessed each trimester, and
those in class III assessed monthly or bimonthly. [9] Beta-blockers
should be continued if they are already being taken (see section 12).
They should be started when new symptoms occur, for rate control
in AF, and to suppress ventricular arrhythmias, with verapamil as second choices when beta-blockers are not tolerated (with foetal monitoring for AV block). [65][,][313]

Cardioversion should be considered for poorly tolerated persistent AF. [314] Therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended for those
with paroxysmal or persistent arrhythmias. Hypovolaemia is poorly
tolerated. Patients with a past history or family history of sudden
death need close surveillance with prompt investigation if they
develop symptoms of palpitations or presyncope. When indicated, a
device should be implanted [315][,][316]


8.3.3 Devices and transplantation
Given the high rate of improvement of LV function during optimal HF
drug therapy, early implantation of an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) in patients with newly diagnosed PPCM or DCM is
not appropriate. A wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) may
prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD) during the first 3–6 months
after diagnosis, especially in patients with EF <35%, allowing protected recovery from severe LV impairment. [279][,][297] In severe LV dysfunction during the 6–12 months following first presentation despite
optimal medical therapy, implantation of an ICD and cardiac resynchronization therapy (for patients with left bundle branch block and
QRS >130ms) are recommended. [286][,][298] However, mortality reduction in those with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy is uncertain. [299]

Cardiac transplantation is reserved for patients where mechanical
circulatory support is not possible or desirable, or for patients who
do not recover after 6–12 months. Patients with PPCM have higher
rates of graft failure and death after heart transplantation. [300]


8.3.3.1 Pregnancy post-cardiac transplantation
Despite successful pregnancies post-cardiac transplantation, data are
limited. Multidisciplinary team management is required relating to the
timing and management of pregnancy. [301] Pre-conception counselling
includes the risks of graft rejection and dysfunction, infection, and the
teratogenicity of immunosuppressive agents. Some centres recommend human leucocyte antigen testing prior to conception. If the
donated heart and father have the same human leucocyte antigen,
and the recipient has donor-specific antigens, the risk of autograft
rejection is high. [302] PPCM recurrence rates in transplanted patients
are unknown. However, as rejection risk in these patients is higher in
the first year post-transplant and graft survival is shorter, many advise
against pregnancy in such patients. [303]

Pregnancy should be avoided for at least 1 year posttransplantation, and discouraged in patients at high-risk of rejection
and/or with poor baseline graft function before pregnancy. [303][–][305]

Besides graft rejection or dysfunction and infection, hypertension is
the most common maternal complication. Additional increased risks
include hyperemesis and thrombo-embolic disease. [301] All immunosuppressive medications enter the foetal circulation, thus the management of immunosuppression in the pregnant post-transplant
recipient is highly specialized. [301] As all immunosuppressive agents are
excreted into breast milk with unknown long-term effects, the
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation currently
recommends against breastfeeding. [303]

3202 ESC Guidelines


8.4.2 Delivery
Low-risk cases may have a spontaneous labour and vaginal delivery.
Caesarean section should be considered in patients with severe LV
outflow tract obstruction, pre-term labour while on OACs, or
severe HF. [9] Epidural and spinal anaesthesia must be applied cautiously, especially with severe LV outflow tract obstruction, because
of potential hypovolaemia, and single-shot spinal anaesthesia avoided. . [.....................]


During delivery, monitoring of heart rate and rhythm should be considered in patients with a high-risk of developing arrhythmias.
Oxytocin should be given as a slow infusion and any i.v. fluids given
judiciously. [9][,][317]

ESC Guidelines 3203

### 9. Arrhythmias

9.1 Introduction
Tachyarrhythmias, particularly AF, [318][,][319] may manifest for the first
time and become more frequent during pregnancy, especially in older
women [318][,][320] and in women with congenital heart disease. [41][,][321] AF
(27/100 000) and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)
(22 - 24/100 000) are, apart from premature beats, the most frequent
arrhythmias. [318] Symptomatic exacerbations of PSVT [322] are usually
benign and can be medically treated effectively. [12] Life-threatening VT
and ventricular fibrillation are very rare during pregnancy, [318] as are
bradyarrhythmias and conduction disturbances. The current
background information and detailed discussion of the data for the
[following section of these Guidelines can be found in ESC](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0692)

[CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0692)

9.2 Maternal risk
AF is associated with an increased mortality risk [318] [odds ratio (OR)
13.13, 95% CI 7.77–22.21; P <0.0001], and a rapid ventricular
response can lead to serious haemodynamic consequences for both
the mother and the foetus. Diagnosis and treatment of underlying
conditions are the first priorities. Patients with a known history of
any symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or VT should be
considered for catheter ablation prior to pregnancy.

SCD is recognized as an increasing risk factor in pregnancy and
therefore cascade screening for channelopathies with genetic counselling [2][,][3][,][72] is important. Women with congenital LQTS are at substantial risk of cardiac events during the post-partum period. [323]

New-onset VT warrants the exclusion of underlying structural heart
disease, [324] as it is associated with increased risk of SCD for the
mother (OR 40.89, 95% CI 26.08–64.1; P <0.0001). [318]

Bradyarrhythmias and conduction disturbances usually have a
favourable outcome in the absence of underlying heart disease.

9.3 Obstetric and offspring risk
Pregnant PSVT subjects have worse obstetric and foetal outcomes,
with higher adjusted ORs (1.54–3.52) for severe maternal morbidity,
caesarean delivery, low birth weight, pre-term labour, foetal stress,
and foetal abnormalities than those without PSVT. [325] Women with

congenital heart disease are more likely to die during admission for
delivery than those without (OR 6.7), arrhythmia being the most frequent cardiovascular event. [321] Recommendations for optimal surveillance levels during delivery for women with arrhythmias are outlined
in ‘Recommendations for the management of arrhythmias’.

9.4 Supraventricular tachycardia
Recommendations for acute termination of PSVT (AV nodal re-entry

[326] are outlined in . [..................................................................................................................................................]


‘Recommendations for the management of arrhythmias’ below. The
i.v. administration of adenosine is recommended as the first drug of
choice for acute conversion of PSVT (see table ‘Recommendations
for the management of arrhythmias’).

For the prevention of PSVT, beta-blockers (except atenolol) or
verapamil are first-line agents, except for patients with
Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (see section 12). [12][,][32][,][327][,][328] The
use of preventive drug therapy should be related to the severity of
symptoms and haemodynamic compromise during tachycardia.

Focal atrial tachycardia (AT) can be associated with drug resistance
and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Adenosine may aid in diagnosis and terminates focal AT in 30% of cases. AV nodal blocking
drugs are recommended for long-term rate control. Flecainide, propafenone (in the absence of ischaemic heart disease), or sotalol should
be considered for rhythm control if these agents fail (see Table 7). [12]

9.5 Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter

Electrical cardioversion is recommended whenever ongoing AF is
haemodynamically unstable or a considerable risk for the mother or
the foetus. [306] Delivery of i.v. butilide or flecainide may be considered
for the termination of atrial flutter and AF in stable patients with
structurally normal hearts. [12][,][329] Cardioversion should generally be
preceded by anticoagulation (see below). [306] The use of i.v. beta
blockers is recommended for rate control.

Rhythm control should be considered as the preferred treatment
strategy during pregnancy, starting with a beta-blocker as the first
option. [306] In the case of a rate control strategy, an oral beta-blocker
is recommended (see Table 7).

Episodes of atrial flutter are usually not well tolerated in patients
with congenital heart disease and electrical cardioversion should
therefore be performed to restore sinus rhythm. [12] Beta-blockers,
class I antiarrhythmic drugs, and sotalol should be used with caution if
systemic ventricular function is impaired (see section 8).

9.5.1 Anticoagulation

The same rules for stroke risk stratification should be used as in nonpregnant patients. [306] Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulation drugs are
prohibited during pregnancy (see Table 7).

9.6 Ventricular tachycardia
Inherited arrhythmogenic disorders should always be looked for with
appropriate diagnostic tests during or after pregnancy. [72] PPCM
should be ruled out in the case of new-onset VT during the last 6
weeks of pregnancy or in the early post-partum period. [266]

Recommendations for acute termination of VT [72] are outlined in

‘Recommendations for the management of arrhythmias’.
The choice of prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug therapy relates to
the presence of underlying structural heart disease and LV function


9.1 Introduction
Tachyarrhythmias, particularly AF, [318][,][319] may manifest for the first
time and become more frequent during pregnancy, especially in older
women [318][,][320] and in women with congenital heart disease. [41][,][321] AF
(27/100 000) and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)
(22 - 24/100 000) are, apart from premature beats, the most frequent
arrhythmias. [318] Symptomatic exacerbations of PSVT [322] are usually
benign and can be medically treated effectively. [12] Life-threatening VT
and ventricular fibrillation are very rare during pregnancy, [318] as are
bradyarrhythmias and conduction disturbances. The current
background information and detailed discussion of the data for the
[following section of these Guidelines can be found in ESC](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0692)

[CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0692)


9.2 Maternal risk
AF is associated with an increased mortality risk [318] [odds ratio (OR)
13.13, 95% CI 7.77–22.21; P <0.0001], and a rapid ventricular
response can lead to serious haemodynamic consequences for both
the mother and the foetus. Diagnosis and treatment of underlying
conditions are the first priorities. Patients with a known history of
any symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or VT should be
considered for catheter ablation prior to pregnancy.

SCD is recognized as an increasing risk factor in pregnancy and
therefore cascade screening for channelopathies with genetic counselling [2][,][3][,][72] is important. Women with congenital LQTS are at substantial risk of cardiac events during the post-partum period. [323]

New-onset VT warrants the exclusion of underlying structural heart
disease, [324] as it is associated with increased risk of SCD for the
mother (OR 40.89, 95% CI 26.08–64.1; P <0.0001). [318]

Bradyarrhythmias and conduction disturbances usually have a
favourable outcome in the absence of underlying heart disease.


9.3 Obstetric and offspring risk
Pregnant PSVT subjects have worse obstetric and foetal outcomes,
with higher adjusted ORs (1.54–3.52) for severe maternal morbidity,
caesarean delivery, low birth weight, pre-term labour, foetal stress,
and foetal abnormalities than those without PSVT. [325] Women with

congenital heart disease are more likely to die during admission for
delivery than those without (OR 6.7), arrhythmia being the most frequent cardiovascular event. [321] Recommendations for optimal surveillance levels during delivery for women with arrhythmias are outlined
in ‘Recommendations for the management of arrhythmias’.


9.4 Supraventricular tachycardia
Recommendations for acute termination of PSVT (AV nodal re-entry
tachycardia and AV re-entry tachycardia) [326] are outlined in

3204 ESC Guidelines


(see table ‘Recommendations for the management of arrhythmias’).
Idiopathic RV outflow tract tachycardia is the most frequent VT type
and may require prophylactic treatment with a beta-blocker, verapamil, or other antiarrhythmic drugs, and even catheter ablation if drug

treatment fails.

ICD implantation is recommended if an indication emerges during
pregnancy (see table ‘Recommendations for the management of
arrhythmias’). [72][,][330][,][331] Implantation of an ICD in PPCM patients with
VT or low EF should follow ESC Guidelines, [72] considering the relatively high rate (50%) of spontaneous recovery after delivery. Nonselective beta-blockers should be continued throughout pregnancy
and during the post-partum period (at least 40 weeks after delivery) [323] in patients with congenital LQTS [332] and those with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT. [72][,][333] Exceptions may be LQTS patients
without prior syncope or torsade de pointes (TdP), or any other risk
profile, for whom a selective beta-blocker may be chosen.
Management of cardiac arrest in pregnancy is described elsewhere. [256]

9.7 Bradyarrhythmias
9.7.1 Sinus node dysfunction
Rare cases of sinus bradycardia may be related to the supine hypotensive
syndrome of pregnancy. Symptomatic bradycardia should be managed
by changing the position of the mother to a left lateral decubitus position.
For persistent symptoms, a temporary pacemaker may be necessary.

9.7.2 Atrioventricular block

Isolated congenital complete heart block in the mother has a favourable outcome during pregnancy, especially when the escape rhythm
has a narrow QRS complex. [334][,][335] Temporary ventricular pacing during delivery is unnecessary in stable patients with complete heart
block, [334] but recommended in selected women with symptoms due
to the risk of bradycardia and syncope.

9.8 Interventions

9.8.1 Electrical cardioversion

Cardioversion seems safe in all phases of pregnancy as it does

[336] . [.................................................................................................................]


foetal arrhythmias or initiating pre-term labour seems small. [337][,][338]

The foetal heart rate should routinely be controlled after
cardioversion. [339]

9.8.2 Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation should be postponed to the second trimester
if possible, and performed at an experienced centre using nonfluoroscopic electroanatomical mapping and catheter
navigation systems. [15][,][16] Catheter ablation of recurrent drugrefractory AV nodal re-entry tachycardia, AV re-entrant tachycardia, focal ATs, cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter, and
certain benign right-sided VTs may be considered for ablation to
avoid potentially harmful medications during pregnancy (see table
‘Recommendations for the management of arrhythmias’), [12][,][15][,][17]

but has no role for other macroreentry tachycardias or AF. [15][,][17]

9.8.3 Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and
pacing
The implantation of an ICD should be considered prior to pregnancy in patients with high-risk factors for SCD. [72][,][340] Treatment
with an ICD during pregnancy does not cause an increased risk
of major ICD-related complications and is recommended if an
indication emerges (see table ‘Recommendations for the management of arrhythmias’). [330][,][340] Safety considerations regarding radiation during ICD implantation are similar to those discussed for
catheter ablation. Subcutaneous ICD is limited by a lack of pacing
capability and a higher risk of inappropriate shock, which may warrant ICD inactivation during delivery. [341][,][342] The use of WDCs in
PPCM patients is limited [343] and deserves further study as it has
not undergone clinical testing in pregnant patients. Routine ICD
interrogation and advice is recommended prior to delivery.

Implantations, for ICD preferably one chamber, can be performed
safely, especially if the foetus is beyond 8 weeks of gestation.
Echocardiographic guidance or electroanatomical mapping may be
helpful. [344]


9.7 Bradyarrhythmias
9.7.1 Sinus node dysfunction
Rare cases of sinus bradycardia may be related to the supine hypotensive
syndrome of pregnancy. Symptomatic bradycardia should be managed
by changing the position of the mother to a left lateral decubitus position.
For persistent symptoms, a temporary pacemaker may be necessary.


9.7.2 Atrioventricular block

Isolated congenital complete heart block in the mother has a favourable outcome during pregnancy, especially when the escape rhythm
has a narrow QRS complex. [334][,][335] Temporary ventricular pacing during delivery is unnecessary in stable patients with complete heart
block, [334] but recommended in selected women with symptoms due
to the risk of bradycardia and syncope.

Cardioversion seems safe in all phases of pregnancy as it does
not compromise foetal blood flow, [336] and the risk of inducing

### 10. Hypertensive disorders

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are the most common medical
complications, affecting 5–10% of pregnancies worldwide. They
remain a major cause of maternal, foetal, and neonatal morbidity and
mortality. Maternal risks include placental abruption, stroke, multiple
organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The foetus
is at high-risk of intrauterine growth retardation (25% of cases of preeclampsia), pre-maturity (27% of cases of pre-eclampsia), and intrauterine death (4% of cases of pre-eclampsia). [345] The current background information and detailed discussion of the data for the
[following section of these Guidelines can be found in ESC](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0694)

[CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0694)

10.1 Diagnosis and risk assessment
Repeated BP readings should be performed, preferably on two occasions, [346] >_15 min apart in severe hypertension (i.e. >_160/110 mmHg
in the obstetric literature). [9][,][347][,][348]

10.1.1 Blood pressure measurement
BP in pregnancy should be measured in the sitting position (or the
left lateral recumbent during labour) with an appropriately-sized arm
cuff at heart level and using Korotkoff V for diastolic BP (DBP).
Mercury sphygmomanometers are still the gold standard for BP
measurement in pregnancy. Automatic devices tend to under-record
the true BP and are unreliable in severe pre-eclampsia. Therefore,
only devices validated according to recognized protocols should be
used in pregnancy. [349][,][350]

The diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy by ambulatory BP
monitoring (ABPM) is superior to routine BP measurement for the
prediction of pregnancy outcome. [351][,][352] The devices used for ABPM
are technically more accurate than those used for office or home BP
measurement. ABPM avoids unnecessary treatment of white-coat
hypertension, and is useful in the management of high-risk pregnant
women with hypertension and those with diabetic or hypertensive
nephropathy.

10.1.2 Laboratory tests
Basic laboratory investigations recommended for monitoring pregnant hypertensive patients include urinalysis, blood count, haematocrit, liver enzymes, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid (increased in
clinically evident pre-eclampsia, hyperuricaemia in hypertensive preg
nancies identifies women at increased risk of adverse maternal and
foetal outcomes). [353]

All pregnant women should be assessed for proteinuria in early
pregnancy to detect pre-existing renal disease and, in the second half
of pregnancy, to screen for pre-eclampsia. A dipstick test of >_1þ
should prompt further investigations, including an albumin:creatinine
ratio (ACR), [354] which can be quickly determined in a single spot urine
sample. A value <30 mg/mmol can reliably rule out proteinuria in
pregnancy, [355] but a positive test should possibly be followed by a 24
h urine collection. In cases of proteinuria >2 g/day, close monitoring

is warranted. However, the result of a 24 h urine collection is often
inaccurate [356] and the of . [....................................................................................................................................................................]


Consequently, an ACR cut-off of 30 mg/mmol can be used to identify
significant proteinuria.

In addition to basic laboratory tests, the following investigations
may be considered:

 - [Ultrasound investigation of the adrenals, and plasma and urinary]
fractionated metanephrine assays in hypertensive pregnant
women with a suggestive clinical presentation of pheochromocytoma in particular.

 - [Doppler ultrasound of uterine arteries (performed after 20]
weeks of gestation) is useful to detect those at higher risk of gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and intrauterine growth
retardation. [357]

 - [An sFlt1 to placental growth factor (sFlt1:PIGF) ratio <_38 can be]
used to exclude the development of pre-eclampsia in the next
week when suspected clinically. [358][,][359]

10.2 Definition and classification of
hypertension in pregnancy
The definition of hypertension in pregnancy is based only on office
(or in-hospital) BP values [systolic BP (SBP) >_140 mmHg and/or
DBP >_90 mmHg] [360][–][362] and distinguishes mildly (140–159/
90–109 mmHg) or severely (>_ 160/110 mmHg) elevated BP, in
contrast to the grades used by the joint ESC/ESH Hypertension
Guidelines. [348]

Hypertension in pregnancy is not a single entity but comprises: [9]

 - [Pre-existing hypertension][: precedes pregnancy or devel-]
ops before 20 weeks of gestation. It usually persists for more
than 42 days post-partum and may be associated with
proteinuria.

 - [Gestational hypertension][: develops after 20 weeks of gesta-]
tion and usually resolves within 42 days post-partum.

 - [Pre-eclampsia][: gestational hypertension with significant protei-]
nuria (>0.3 g/24 h or ACR >_30 mg/mmol). It occurs more frequently during the first pregnancy, in multiple pregnancy, in
hydatidiform mole, in antiphospholipid syndrome, or with preexisting hypertension, renal disease, or diabetes. It is often associated with foetal growth restriction due to placental insufficiency
and is a common cause of prematurity. The only cure is delivery. [363] As proteinuria may be a late manifestation of preeclampsia, it should be suspected when de novo hypertension is
accompanied by headache, visual disturbances, abdominal pain,
or abnormal laboratory tests, specifically low platelets and/or
abnormal liver function.

 - [Pre-existing] hypertension plus superimposed gestational hypertension with proteinuria.

 - [Antenatally unclassifiable hypertension][: this term is used]
when BP is first recorded after 20 weeks of gestation and hypertension is diagnosed; re-assessment is necessary after 42 days

post-partum.

10.3 Prevention of hypertension and
pre-eclampsia
Women at high or moderate risk of pre-eclampsia should be advised
to take 100–150 mg of aspirin daily from week 12 to weeks
36–37. [364][,][365]


Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are the most common medical
complications, affecting 5–10% of pregnancies worldwide. They
remain a major cause of maternal, foetal, and neonatal morbidity and
mortality. Maternal risks include placental abruption, stroke, multiple
organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The foetus
is at high-risk of intrauterine growth retardation (25% of cases of preeclampsia), pre-maturity (27% of cases of pre-eclampsia), and intrauterine death (4% of cases of pre-eclampsia). [345] The current background information and detailed discussion of the data for the
[following section of these Guidelines can be found in ESC](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0694)

10.1 Diagnosis and risk assessment
Repeated BP readings should be performed, preferably on two occasions, [346] >_15 min apart in severe hypertension (i.e. >_160/110 mmHg
in the obstetric literature). [9][,][347][,][348]


10.1.1 Blood pressure measurement
BP in pregnancy should be measured in the sitting position (or the
left lateral recumbent during labour) with an appropriately-sized arm
cuff at heart level and using Korotkoff V for diastolic BP (DBP).
Mercury sphygmomanometers are still the gold standard for BP
measurement in pregnancy. Automatic devices tend to under-record
the true BP and are unreliable in severe pre-eclampsia. Therefore,
only devices validated according to recognized protocols should be
used in pregnancy. [349][,][350]

The diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy by ambulatory BP
monitoring (ABPM) is superior to routine BP measurement for the
prediction of pregnancy outcome. [351][,][352] The devices used for ABPM
are technically more accurate than those used for office or home BP
measurement. ABPM avoids unnecessary treatment of white-coat
hypertension, and is useful in the management of high-risk pregnant
women with hypertension and those with diabetic or hypertensive
nephropathy.


10.1.2 Laboratory tests
Basic laboratory investigations recommended for monitoring pregnant hypertensive patients include urinalysis, blood count, haematocrit, liver enzymes, serum creatinine, and serum uric acid (increased in
clinically evident pre-eclampsia, hyperuricaemia in hypertensive preg
nancies identifies women at increased risk of adverse maternal and
foetal outcomes). [353]

All pregnant women should be assessed for proteinuria in early
pregnancy to detect pre-existing renal disease and, in the second half
of pregnancy, to screen for pre-eclampsia. A dipstick test of >_1þ
should prompt further investigations, including an albumin:creatinine
ratio (ACR), [354] which can be quickly determined in a single spot urine
sample. A value <30 mg/mmol can reliably rule out proteinuria in
pregnancy, [355] but a positive test should possibly be followed by a 24
h urine collection. In cases of proteinuria >2 g/day, close monitoring

is warranted. However, the result of a 24 h urine collection is often
inaccurate [356] and delays the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia.

3208 ESC Guidelines


High risk of pre-eclampsia includes any of the following:

[hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy]

[chronic kidney disease]

[autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or]
antiphospholipid syndrome

[type 1 or type 2 diabetes]

[chronic hypertension.]

Moderate risk of pre-eclampsia includes more than one of the following risk factors:

[first pregnancy]

[age 40 years or older]

[pregnancy interval of more than 10 years]

[BMI of >_35 kg/m] [2] [ at first visit]

[family history of pre-eclampsia]

[multiple pregnancy.]

Calcium supplementation (1.5–2 g/day, orally) is recommended
for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in women with low dietary intake
of calcium (<600 mg/day), [366] to be commenced at the first antenatal

Vitamins C and E do not decrease pre-eclampsia risk; on the contrary, they are more frequently associated with a birth weight <2.5 kg
and adverse perinatal outcomes. [367][–][370]

10.4 Management of hypertension in

pregnancy
10.4.1 Background
Management of hypertension in pregnancy depends on the BP, gestational age, and the presence of associated maternal and foetal risk

Most women with pre-existing hypertension and normal renal
function have non-severe hypertension (140–159/90–109 mmHg)
and are at low-risk for cardiovascular complications. Some are able
to withdraw their medication in the first half of pregnancy because of
the physiological fall in BP.
Evidence-based data regarding treatment of hypertension in pregnancy are lacking. The only trial of treatment of hypertension in pregnancy with adequate infant follow-up (7.5 years) was performed 40
years ago with a-methyldopa. [371][,][372]

In terms of treatment benefit, tight vs. less-tight control of hypertension in pregnancy in the Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy
Study was associated with less severe maternal hypertension, but no
difference in the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and overall serious maternal complications. [373] However, a secondary analysis of the
data showed that women developing severe hypertension had higher
rates of adverse maternal (pre-eclampsia, platelets <100 � 10 [9] /L, elevated liver enzymes with symptoms, and maternal length of hospital
stay >_10 days) and perinatal outcomes (perinatal death, high-level
neonatal care for >48 h, birth weight <10th percentile, preeclampsia, and pre-term delivery). [374] Thus, there is no evidence currently supporting target BP values in pregnancy. [373][,][375]

10.4.2 Non-pharmacological management
Non-pharmacological management of hypertension during pregnancy
has a limited role to play, with randomized studies of dietary and life
[376] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Regular exercise might be continued with caution and obese women
(>_30 kg/m [2] ) are advised to avoid a weight gain of more than 6.8 kg. [377]

10.4.3 Pharmacological management
While the goal of treating hypertension is to reduce maternal risk,
the agents selected must be effective and safe for the foetus.

10.4.3.1 Treatment of severe hypertension
There is no agreed definition of severe hypertension, with values ranging between 160–180 mmHg to >110 mmHg. This Task Force recommends considering an SBP >_170 mmHg or DBP >_110 mmHg in a
pregnant woman an emergency, and hospitalization is indicated. The
selection of the antihypertensive drug and its route of administration
depend on the expected time of delivery. ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and
direct renin inhibitors are strictly contraindicated (see section 12).
Pharmacological treatment with i.v. labetalol, oral methyldopa, or nifedipine should be initiated; i.v. hydralazine is no longer the drug of
choice as its use is associated with more perinatal adverse effects than
other drugs. [378] However, hydralazine is still commonly used when
other treatment regimens have failed to achieve adequate BP control
as most obstetricians find its side effect profile acceptable. [379] Use of i.v.
urapidil can also be considered. Sodium nitroprusside should only be
used as the drug of last choice since prolonged treatment is associated
with an increased risk of foetal cyanide poisoning. [51] The drug of choice
when pre-eclampsia is associated with pulmonary oedema is nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate), given as an i.v. infusion of 5 lg/min, and gradually increased every 3–5 min to a maximum dose of 100 lg/min.

–
10.4.3.2 Treatment of mild moderate hypertension
Despite a lack of evidence, the European Guidelines [9][,][348][,][375] recommend the initiation of drug treatment in all women with persistent elevation
of BP �150/95 mmHg and at values >140/90 mmHg in women with:

 - [gestational hypertension (with or without proteinuria)]

 - [pre-existing hypertension with the superimposition of gestational]
hypertension

 - [hypertension with subclinical organ damage or symptoms at any]
time during pregnancy.

Methyldopa, beta-blockers (most data available for labetalol), and
calcium antagonists (most data available for nifedipine) are the drugs of
choice. [380][,][381] Beta-blockers appear to be less effective than calcium
antagonists and may induce foetal bradycardia, growth retardation, and
hypoglycaemia; consequently, their type and dose should be carefully
selected, with atenolol best avoided (see section 12 and Table 7).
Women with pre-existing hypertension may continue their current
antihypertensive medication unless on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct

renin inhibitors, which are contraindicated due to adverse foetal and

neonatal outcomes. The plasma volume is reduced in pre-eclampsia,
therefore diuretic therapy is best avoided unless in the context of oliguria, when low-dose furosemide may be considered. Delivery of i.v.
magnesium sulfate is recommended for the prevention of eclampsia
and treatment of seizures, but should not be given concomitantly with
CCBs (there is a risk of hypotension due to potential synergism). [382]

10.5 Delivery
Delivery is indicated in pre-eclampsia with visual disturbances or haemostatic disorders, and at 37 weeks in asymptomatic women. [383]



- [hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy]

- [chronic kidney disease]

- [autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or]
antiphospholipid syndrome

- [type 1 or type 2 diabetes]

- [chronic hypertension.]


Moderate risk of pre-eclampsia includes more than one of the following risk factors:



- [first pregnancy]

- [age 40 years or older]

- [pregnancy interval of more than 10 years]

- [BMI of >_35 kg/m] [2] [ at first visit]

- [family history of pre-eclampsia]

- [multiple pregnancy.]


Calcium supplementation (1.5–2 g/day, orally) is recommended
for the prevention of pre-eclampsia in women with low dietary intake
of calcium (<600 mg/day), [366] to be commenced at the first antenatal

clinic.

Vitamins C and E do not decrease pre-eclampsia risk; on the contrary, they are more frequently associated with a birth weight <2.5 kg
and adverse perinatal outcomes. [367][–][370]


10.4 Management of hypertension in

pregnancy
10.4.1 Background
Management of hypertension in pregnancy depends on the BP, gestational age, and the presence of associated maternal and foetal risk

factors.

Most women with pre-existing hypertension and normal renal
function have non-severe hypertension (140–159/90–109 mmHg)
and are at low-risk for cardiovascular complications. Some are able
to withdraw their medication in the first half of pregnancy because of

neonatal care for >48 h, birth weight <10th percentile, preeclampsia, and pre-term delivery). [374] Thus, there is no evidence currently supporting target BP values in pregnancy. [373][,][375]


10.4.2 Non-pharmacological management
Non-pharmacological management of hypertension during pregnancy
has a limited role to play, with randomized studies of dietary and lifestyle interventions showing minimal effects on pregnancy outcome. [376]

ESC Guidelines 3209


10.6 Prognosis after pregnancy
10.6.1 Blood pressure post-partum
Post-partum hypertension is common in the first week. Methyldopa
should be avoided because of the risk of post-partum depression. [384]

10.6.2 Hypertension and lactation
Breastfeeding does not increase BP in the nursing mother.
Cabergoline, rather than bromocriptine, is recommended for lactation
suppression. However, there is some evidence that bromocriptine
might be beneficial in PPCM, [264] although it may induce hypertension.

All antihypertensive agents taken by the nursing mother are
excreted into breast milk. [385] Most of the antihypertensive drugs are
present at very low concentrations, except for propranolol and nifedipine, which have breast milk concentrations similar to those in
maternal plasma.

10.6.3 Risk of recurrence of hypertensive disorders in a
subsequent pregnancy
Women experiencing hypertension in their first pregnancy are at
increased risk in a subsequent pregnancy. The earlier the onset of . [.............................................................]


hypertension in the first pregnancy, the higher the risk of recurrence
in a subsequent pregnancy.

10.6.4 Long-term cardiovascular consequences of gestational hypertension
Women who develop gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia are
at increased risk of hypertension, stroke, and ischaemic heart disease
in later adult life. [386][,][387] Lifestyle modifications are primarily indicated
to avoid complications in subsequent pregnancies and to reduce

maternal cardiovascular risk in the future. Therefore, annual visits to

a primary care physician to check BP and metabolic factors are

recommended.

10.6.5 Fertility treatment
There is no clear evidence that fertility treatment increases the risk
of hypertension or pre-eclampsia. [388]

3210 ESC Guidelines

### 11. Venous thrombo-embolic dis- ease during pregnancy and the puerperium

11.1 Epidemiology and maternal risk
VTE, encompassing PE and deep vein/venous thrombosis (DVT), represents a significant cause of pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality. Pregnancy and the puerperium are associated with an increased
incidence of VTE occurring in around 0.05–0.20% of all pregnancies, [390][–][393] and rates of PE of around 0.03%. [394][,][395] PE is the most

common cause of direct maternal death in the UK, with an incidence

of 1.26 deaths per 100 000 pregnancies, and it is the fifth most common cause of maternal death overall. [3] The case fatality rate is
3.5%. [396] The risk of VTE is highest in the immediate post-partum
period with rates of nearly 0.5% reported, [394][,][397] and returns to the
non-pregnant level after the sixth week post-partum. [390][,][394][,][397] In
women with previous VTE, recurrence rates are 7.6%, and in a highrisk population rates are 5.5% despite the use of LMWH. [398][,][399]

Consequently, a high index of suspicion and a low threshold for
investigation must be maintained in pregnant women in general and
in high-risk women specifically. The current background information and detailed discussion of the data for the following section of

[these Guidelines can be found in ESC CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0695)

11.2 Risk factors for pregnancy-related
venous thrombo-embolism and risk

stratification

The presence of one risk factor increases the rate of VTE from 0.02
to 0.05%. [397][,][400] Consequently, all women should undergo a documented assessment of risk factors for VTE before pregnancy or in
early pregnancy. [401] Based on this, women can be classified as being at
high, intermediate, or low-risk of VTE and preventative measures
applied accordingly. [401] Previous unprovoked recurrent VTEs and
previous VTE—unprovoked or oestrogen-related—are considered
high-risk factors.

11.3 Prevention of venous thrombo
embolism

Prospective, non-randomized studies have shown that in women
with risk factors not receiving anticoagulation, the recurrence rate of
VTE ranged from 2.4–12.2%, in comparison with 0–5.5% in patients
who did receive anticoagulation. [399][,][402] LMWH has become the drug
of choice for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pregnant
patients. [13] It causes less bone loss than UFH, and the osteoporotic
fracture rate is lower (0.04% of pregnant women treated with
LMWH). [13] The initial dose of LMWH for thromboprophylaxis
should be based on the booking weight (body weight at the first antenatal appointment with the gynaecologist, e.g. 8–10 weeks of pregnancy) since weight-based LMWH regimens have been shown to
achieve prophylactic anti-Xa levels more effectively. [403]

Consequently, patients at high-risk for VTE should receive prophylactic enoxaparin at 0.5 IU/kg of body weight once daily [403] or another

. [.........................................................................................................................................................................]


obese women, weight-based dosing instead of fixed dosing is more
appropriate in order to achieve adequate anti-Xa concentrations. [404]

11.4 Management of acute venous
thrombo-embolism

11.4.1 Pulmonary embolism
11.4.1.1 Clinical presentation
The symptoms and signs of PE during pregnancy are the same as in
the non-pregnant state (dyspnoea, chest pain, tachycardia, haemoptysis, and collapse). However, subjective clinical assessment of PE is
more difficult because dyspnoea and tachycardia are relatively common in normal pregnancy.

11.4.1.2 Diagnosis
Clinical prediction rules for assigning pre-test probabilities of VTE
have been validated and diagnostic algorithms established in the nonpregnant patient. These include the use of D-dimer testing, compression ultrasonography, CT pulmonary angiography, and ventilation/
perfusion lung scanning. [405] This is not the case in pregnant women. [406]

A high index of suspicion is important, and all pregnant women with
signs and symptoms suggestive of VTE should have objective testing
performed urgently and receive therapeutic anticoagulation until the
diagnosis is established.

D-dimer levels increase physiologically with each trimester. In one
study, the mean [standard deviation (SD)] preconception D-dimer
concentration was 0.43 (0.49) mg/L, and rose in the first, second, and
third trimesters to 0.58 (SD 0.36), 0.83 (SD 0.46), and 1.16 (SD 0.57)
mg/L, respectively, indicating a 39% relative increase in D-dimer concentration for each trimester. [407] Thus, a positive D-dimer test in
pregnancy is not necessarily indicative of VTE and further objective
testing is required. A negative D-dimer test helps to exclude VTE
outside pregnancy, but normal D-dimer concentrations have been
reported in pregnant women with VTE, [408] meaning that imaging
remains the diagnostic test of choice during pregnancy. [409] Currently,
the optimal diagnostic approach for the pregnant patient with suspected PE is uncertain. [410] A modified Wells score may be useful
alone or in combination with D-dimer testing to stratify women into
those needing imaging, allowing the remainder to avoid unnecessary
radiation exposure, [411][,][412] but this awaits further study.

If the index of suspicion of DVT remains high, then compression
ultrasound should be performed, and if this is abnormal then anticoagulation is indicated. If compression ultrasonography is negative, then
further testing is required and MRI should be performed. Where PE
is suspected and all other investigations are normal, low-dose CT

should be undertaken.

1.4.1.3 Treatment

LMWH: LMWH has become the drug of choice for the treatment of VTE in pregnancy and the puerperium. In suspected DVT or
PE, therapeutic LMWH should be given until the diagnosis is
excluded by objective testing.
Dosage: The recommended therapeutic dose is calculated on
early pregnancy body weight (e.g. enoxaparin 1 mg/kg body weight
twice daily, dalteparin 100 IU/kg body weight twice daily, or tinzaparin
175 IU/kg), aiming for 4–6 h peak anti-Xa values of 0.6–1.2 IU/mL. [413]


11.1 Epidemiology and maternal risk
VTE, encompassing PE and deep vein/venous thrombosis (DVT), represents a significant cause of pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality. Pregnancy and the puerperium are associated with an increased
incidence of VTE occurring in around 0.05–0.20% of all pregnancies, [390][–][393] and rates of PE of around 0.03%. [394][,][395] PE is the most

common cause of direct maternal death in the UK, with an incidence

of 1.26 deaths per 100 000 pregnancies, and it is the fifth most common cause of maternal death overall. [3] The case fatality rate is
3.5%. [396] The risk of VTE is highest in the immediate post-partum
period with rates of nearly 0.5% reported, [394][,][397] and returns to the
non-pregnant level after the sixth week post-partum. [390][,][394][,][397] In
women with previous VTE, recurrence rates are 7.6%, and in a highrisk population rates are 5.5% despite the use of LMWH. [398][,][399]

Consequently, a high index of suspicion and a low threshold for
investigation must be maintained in pregnant women in general and
in high-risk women specifically. The current background information and detailed discussion of the data for the following section of

[these Guidelines can be found in ESC CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0695)


11.2 Risk factors for pregnancy-related
venous thrombo-embolism and risk

stratification

The presence of one risk factor increases the rate of VTE from 0.02
to 0.05%. [397][,][400] Consequently, all women should undergo a documented assessment of risk factors for VTE before pregnancy or in
early pregnancy. [401] Based on this, women can be classified as being at
high, intermediate, or low-risk of VTE and preventative measures
applied accordingly. [401] Previous unprovoked recurrent VTEs and
previous VTE—unprovoked or oestrogen-related—are considered
high-risk factors.


11.3 Prevention of venous thrombo
embolism

Prospective, non-randomized studies have shown that in women
with risk factors not receiving anticoagulation, the recurrence rate of
VTE ranged from 2.4–12.2%, in comparison with 0–5.5% in patients
who did receive anticoagulation. [399][,][402] LMWH has become the drug
of choice for the prevention and treatment of VTE in pregnant
patients. [13] It causes less bone loss than UFH, and the osteoporotic
fracture rate is lower (0.04% of pregnant women treated with
LMWH). [13] The initial dose of LMWH for thromboprophylaxis
should be based on the booking weight (body weight at the first antenatal appointment with the gynaecologist, e.g. 8–10 weeks of pregnancy) since weight-based LMWH regimens have been shown to
achieve prophylactic anti-Xa levels more effectively. [403]

Consequently, patients at high-risk for VTE should receive prophylactic enoxaparin at 0.5 IU/kg of body weight once daily [403] or another
LMWH at equivalent doses, according to local practice. In morbidly

ESC Guidelines 3211


Monitoring (see section 12).
UFH: Typically, UFH is used in the acute treatment of massive
pulmonary emboli. For details on management, see section 12.
Thrombolysis: Thrombolytics should only be used in patients
with severe hypotension or shock [405] (see section 12). When thrombolysis has been given, the loading dose of UFH should be omitted
and an infusion started at a rate of 18 U/kg/h. After stabilization of the
patient, UFH can be switched to LMWH.

Fondaparinux: Fondaparinux (7.5 mg once a day in normalweight pregnant women) can be considered if there is an allergy or
adverse response to LMWH (see section 12).

Vena cava filters: Indications for vena cava filters are the same as

in non-pregnant patients. However, there is limited experience with
their use and the risk associated with the procedure may be
increased. [405][,][414]

Post-partum management: In patients with recent PE, prepartum heparin treatment should be restarted 6 h after a vaginal birth
and 12 h after a caesarean delivery, if no significant bleeding has
occurred, with subsequent overlap with VKAs for at least 5 days.
VKAs may be started on the second day after delivery and continued
for at least 3 months, or for 6 months if PE occurred late in pregnancy. The INR should be between 2 and 3 and needs regular monitoring, ideally every 1–2 weeks. VKAs do not enter the breast milk in
active forms and are safe for nursing mothers.

11.4.2 Acute deep vein thrombosis
11.4.2.1 Clinical presentation
Leg swelling is a frequent finding in pregnancy, giving rise to the suspi
cion of DVT. Since DVT is left-sided in >85% of cases, due to com
pression of the left iliac vein by the left iliac artery and the gravid
uterus, swelling of the left leg is more suspicious. Iliac vein thrombosis
may manifest with isolated pain in the buttock, groin, flank, or abdomen. Three clinical variables-left leg presentation, >2 cm calf circumference difference, and first trimester-allowed a negative predictive
value of 100% (95% CI 95.8–100%) if none of the three variables was
present and ultrasound of the legs was negative. [415] However, this
clinical decision rule needs to be validated in prospective studies.

11.4.2.2 Diagnosis

D-dimer: See section 11.4.1.2.

Compression ultrasound leg vein imaging: Compression
ultrasound is the diagnostic imaging procedure of choice for suspected DVT in pregnancy with a high sensitivity and specificity for

. [......................................................................................................................................]


compression ultrasound evaluations at days 0, 3, and 7 in pregnancy
give a high negative predictive value of 99.5% (95% CI 97–99%). [416]

Women with a suspected DVT in pregnancy can be evaluated with
D-dimer testing (see above) and compression ultrasonography. If a
proximal DVT is detected, treatment should be continued. If the initial compression ultrasound is negative, then magnetic resonance
venography may be considered to exclude a pelvic DVT. If the clinical
suspicion is high and the initial compression ultrasonography negative, then anticoagulation should be continued and compression
ultrasonography repeated on days 3 and 7. If the initial clinical suspicion is low, then anticoagulation can be stopped and compression
ultrasonography repeated on days 3 and 7. If compression ultrasonography is persistently negative, a DVT can be excluded.

11.4.2.3 Treatment

In acute DVT, treatment with therapeutic doses of weight adjusted
LMWH should be given twice daily (see treatment of PE).

11.5 Recommendations

11.5.1 Management of delivery
In women on therapeutic LMWH, delivery should be planned at
around 39 weeks to avoid the risk of spontaneous labour while fully
anticoagulated, as LMWH can only be partially reversed with prot
amine sulfate.

In high-risk women on therapeutic LMWH, LMWH should be
converted to UFH at least 36 h prior to delivery and the infusion
stopped some 4–6 hours prior to anticipated delivery. A normalized
aPTT should guide the use of regional anaesthesia.
In low-risk women on therapeutic LMWH or women on high
dose prophylaxis, assuming a typical twice-a-day regimen, the evening

LMWH dose should be omitted and induction or caesarean section

performed the next morning, with regional anaesthesia started more
than 24 h after the last dose of LMWH and if no other drugs with
impairment of coagulation are used.
Therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with an increased risk of
post-partum haemorrhage, so the third stage of labour should always
be actively managed with modified dose oxytocin. Recently, the effect
of adding 2 IU oxytocin over 5 min to a standard treatment of lowdose infusion for 4 h [10 U of oxytocin in 500 mL of normal saline
given i.v. at 36 mL/h for 4 h (12 mU/min)] was analysed. The addition
of 2 IU of oxytocin was not associated with any greater derangement
in cardiovascular measures, but with a significantly lower volume of
blood loss. [105] We would advise using this regimen.


Fondaparinux: Fondaparinux (7.5 mg once a day in normalweight pregnant women) can be considered if there is an allergy or
adverse response to LMWH (see section 12).

Vena cava filters: Indications for vena cava filters are the same as

in non-pregnant patients. However, there is limited experience with
their use and the risk associated with the procedure may be
increased. [405][,][414]

Post-partum management: In patients with recent PE, prepartum heparin treatment should be restarted 6 h after a vaginal birth
and 12 h after a caesarean delivery, if no significant bleeding has
occurred, with subsequent overlap with VKAs for at least 5 days.
VKAs may be started on the second day after delivery and continued
for at least 3 months, or for 6 months if PE occurred late in pregnancy. The INR should be between 2 and 3 and needs regular monitoring, ideally every 1–2 weeks. VKAs do not enter the breast milk in
active forms and are safe for nursing mothers.


11.4.2 Acute deep vein thrombosis
11.4.2.1 Clinical presentation
Leg swelling is a frequent finding in pregnancy, giving rise to the suspi
cion of DVT. Since DVT is left-sided in >85% of cases, due to com
pression of the left iliac vein by the left iliac artery and the gravid
uterus, swelling of the left leg is more suspicious. Iliac vein thrombosis
may manifest with isolated pain in the buttock, groin, flank, or abdomen. Three clinical variables-left leg presentation, >2 cm calf circumference difference, and first trimester-allowed a negative predictive
value of 100% (95% CI 95.8–100%) if none of the three variables was
present and ultrasound of the legs was negative. [415] However, this
clinical decision rule needs to be validated in prospective studies.


11.4.2.2 Diagnosis

D-dimer: See section 11.4.1.2.

Compression ultrasound leg vein imaging: Compression
ultrasound is the diagnostic imaging procedure of choice for suspected DVT in pregnancy with a high sensitivity and specificity for
proximal DVT, but less so for distal and pelvic DVTs. Serial

### 12. Drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding

12.1 General principles
This section summarizes all pertinent drugs and their potential use
during pregnancy and breastfeeding. There are no uniform recommendations for the treatment of pregnant women yet. This also concerns the timing of treatment initiation and the selection of
medications. Prescribing information for drugs on specific databases
for pregnancy and lactation (for internet databases see section 12.3)
should be consulted. As drug treatment in pregnancy concerns the
mother and the foetus, optimum treatment of both must be targeted.
Whether drug treatment is necessary is dependent on the urgency of
the indication. The current background information and detailed
discussion of the data for the following section of these Guidelines

[can be found in ESC CardioMed.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0696)

In case of emergency, drugs that are not recommended by international agencies for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding
should not be withheld from the mother. The potential risk of a
drug and the possible benefit of the therapy must be weighed
against each other. . [.................................................................]


12.1.1 Pharmacokinetics in pregnancy
During pregnancy, profound physiological changes occur that
potentially change the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs. [36] The following list provides a summary of these changes:

Cardiovascular system, lungs and blood:

 - [increases in plasma volume, CO, stroke volume, and heart rate]

 - [decreases in serum albumin concentration and serum colloid]

osmotic pressure

 - [increases in coagulation factors and fibrinogen]

 - [compression of the inferior vena cava by the uterus]

 - [increase in tidal volume and minute ventilation.]

Liver, stomach, and intestines:

 - [changes in oxidative liver enzymes, such as increased activity of]
cytochrome P450 enzymes e.g. CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 nausea
and vomiting

 - [delayed gastric emptying]

 - [prolonged small bowel transit time]

 - [gastrointestinal reflux.]

Kidneys:

 - [increases in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.]

ESC Guidelines 3213


Different sources of evidence can be used for the risk classification

of drugs applied during pregnancy.

12.1.2 Drug classes in pregnancy
12.1.2.1 Anticoagulants
VKA and LMWH have advantages and disadvantages during pregnancy,
which are also discussed in the sections related to specific indications.
However, comparison between studies is hampered by reporting differences, and conclusions concerning the safety of low-dose VKA
(warfarin <5 mg daily) in the current literature are controversial. [5][,][196][,][217][,][219][,][223][,][227] VKAs cross the placenta and their use in the first
trimester can result in embryopathy (limb defects and nasal hypoplasia)
in 0.6–10% of cases. [216][,][218][,][219][,][228] Substitution of a VKA with UFH or

LMWH in weeks 6–12 almost eliminates the risk of embryopathy.
There is evidence that the embryopathy risk with VKA is also dosedependent. The risk was 0.45–0.9% in pregnancies with low-dose warfarin according to two recent systematic reviews. [217][,][219] In addition to
the risk of embryopathy that is limited to the first trimester, there is a
0.7–2% risk of foetopathy (e.g. ocular and central nervous system
abnormalities and intracranial haemorrhage) when VKAs are used in
the second and third trimesters. [216][,][219][,][223][,][228][–][230] Foetopathy has also
been described with UFH but not with LMWH throughout pregnancy. [219][,][223] Vaginal delivery while the mother is on VKAs is contraindicated because of the risk of foetal intracranial bleeding. [228]

Haemorrhagic complications in the mother occur with all regimens. [219]

The efficacy and safety of several LMWH preparations was shown in a
reviewof2777pregnantwomentreatedforDVTorPE.Theriskofrecurrent VTE with therapeutic doses of LMWH was 1.15%. The observed
rate of major bleeding was 1.98%. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is
markedlylowerwithLMWHthanwithUFH,asisheparin-inducedosteoporosis (0.04%). [13] In clinically suspected DVT or PE, therapeutic LMWH
shouldbegivenuntilthediagnosisisexcludedbyobjectivetesting.

Monitoring is essential in patients treated with LMWH with
mechanical valves (see section 6), but the evidence is less clear in
patients with VTE. Given the need for dose increase as pregnancy progresses to maintain a certain therapeutic anti-Xa level (peak: 0.7–1.2
U/mL), [224][,][421] it seems reasonable to also determine anti-Xa peak levels
during pregnancy in patients with VTE. This appears particularly justified in view of the fact that PE occurred in women receiving prophylactic doses of LMWH. [396] As with the use of LMWH in women with

mechanical valves, using trough levels and adjusting the dosage frequency may be necessary to achieve adequate anticoagulation. [225]

UFH does not cross the placenta either, but is associated with more
thrombocytopenia (platelet levels should be measured every 2–3
days), osteoporosis, and more frequent dosing when given subcutaneously compared with LMWH. Typically, UFH is used in the acute treatment of massive pulmonary emboli. It is also used around the time of
delivery if the maintenance of anticoagulation is critical and when the
ability to reverse anticoagulation urgently using protamine is advantageous. In this circumstance, LMWH should be switched to i.v. UFH at
least 36 h before the induction of labour or caesarean delivery is
planned. UFH should be discontinued 4–6 h before anticipated delivery
and restarted 6 h after delivery if there are no bleeding complications.

12.1.2.2 Thrombolytics
Thrombolytics are considered to be relatively contraindicated during

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


patients with severe hypotension or shock. [405] The risk of haemorrhage, mostly from the genital tract, is around 8%. [422] There are more
than 200 reported patients in whom streptokinase was mostly used
and, more recently, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase). Neither of these thrombolytics crosses the placenta in significant amounts. Foetal loss in 6% and pre-term delivery in 6% of cases
were reported. [414] When thrombolysis is given, the loading dose of
UFH should be omitted and an infusion started at a rate of 18 U/kg/h,
and carefully adjusted according to the aPTT level. After stabilization
of the patient, UFH can be switched to LMWH.

12.1.2.3 Factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors

No adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women are

available.

Fondaparinux indirectly inhibits factor Xa activity via ATIII binding.
There are a few observational studies on the use of fondaparinux in
pregnancy, with the largest reporting good outcomes for 65 pregnancies managed with fondaparinux. [423] Its use can be considered if there
is an allergy or adverse response to LMWH. One study showed
minor transplacental passage of fondaparinux, [424] and more work is
required to assess the risk of congenital malformations.

Rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, crosses the placental barrier and therefore is not recommended in pregnancy. A systematic
review of 137 pregnancies with pregnancy outcome data revealed
a miscarriage rate of 23% (n = 31), elective terminations in 29%
(n = 39) of cases, and possible embryopathy in 2.2% (n = 3) of cases. [425]

Most cases were on rivaroxaban, and in most pregnancies the duration of use was limited to the first trimester. Rivaroxaban is currently
not recommended in pregnant patients. Other direct factor Xa
inhibitors—such as apixaban, edoxaban, and the direct oral thrombin
inhibitor dabigatran—should not be used in pregnant patients.

12.1.2.4 Beta-adrenergic blocking agents
Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are generally safe in pregnancy, but
may be associated with increased rates of foetal growth restriction
and also hypoglycaemia. Beta-1-selective drugs are preferred, [426]

except in TdP (see section 9), as they are less likely to affect uterine
contraction and peripheral vasodilation, and they have exhibited
lower rates of foetal growth retardation. [427] Examples are metoprolol
and bisoprolol. Unselective beta-blockers such as atenolol have been
associated with higher rates of foetal growth retardation. [427][,][428]

Among the alpha/beta-blockers, labetalol is a drug of choice for
hypertension in pregnancy [380][,][381], and carvedilol used for HF therapy
did not show any association with foetal growth retardation in a
recently published small study with 13 patients receiving this drug. [427]

12.1.2.5 Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, and aldosterone antagonists
ACE inhibitors and ARBs are teratogenic and contraindicated during
pregnancy. [36] Renal or tubular dysplasia, renal failure, oligohydramnios, growth retardation, ossification disorders of the skull, lung
hypoplasia, contractures, large joints, anaemia, and intrauterine foetal
death have been described. In a systematic review, 48% of 118 foetuses exposed to ACE inhibitors and 87% of foetuses exposed to
ARBs had complications related to the use of these medications. [36]

These recommendations and data also apply to ARNIs (sacubitril/valsartan), since they contain ARBs.

VKA and LMWH have advantages and disadvantages during pregnancy,
which are also discussed in the sections related to specific indications.
However, comparison between studies is hampered by reporting differences, and conclusions concerning the safety of low-dose VKA

and restarted 6 h after delivery if there are no bleeding complications.


12.1.2.2 Thrombolytics
Thrombolytics are considered to be relatively contraindicated during
pregnancy and peripartum, and should only be used in high-risk

3214 ESC Guidelines


Spironolactone is not advised in humans during pregnancy. [36]

Eplerenone has been associated with post-implantation losses at the
highest administered doses in rabbits, and should only be used in
pregnancy if clearly needed.

12.1.2.6 Calcium channel blockers

CCBs do not seem to be associated with an increased incidence of
congenital anomalies in humans. [36] In one study with 721 pregnancies
exposed to CCBs during the third trimester, an increased risk (relative risk 3.6, 95% CI 1.3–10.4) of neonatal seizures with CCBs was

[36][,][429] Diltiazem is teratogenic in animals and only limited
data in humans exist; thus, its use is only recommended in pregnancy
if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. [36]

Verapamil is considered to be fairly safe during pregnancy, and is recommended as a second-line drug for rate control in AF and for the
treatment of idiopathic sustained VTs in pregnant women. [36]

12.1.2.7 Statins

Statins should not be prescribed in pregnancy or during breastfeeding
to treat hyperlipidaemia since their harmlessness is not proven.
However, in a review published in 2012, no evidence of teratogenicity of statins was found, but a harmful effect could not be ruled out
due to small sample sizes. [36][,][430] In a prospective case-control study of
249 foetuses exposed to statins, the rate of birth defects did not differ significantly between cases and controls. [36][,][431]

12.2 US Food and Drug Administration
classification

changed the previously used classification system for the counselling . [.................................................................................................]

12.2 US Food and Drug Administration
classification

On 30 June 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
changed the previously used classification system for the counselling
of pregnant women and nursing mothers requiring drug therapy. [432]

The former A to X categories have been replaced by the Pregnancy
and Lactation Labelling Rule (PLLR), which provides a descriptive risk
summary and detailed information on animal and clinical data. PLLR
applies immediately for prescription drugs approved after 30 June
2015, and the former FDA categories have to be removed for all
other drugs until 29 June 2018. However, the former FDA categories
will be present in the literature for a longer period of time, therefore
Table 7 provides information on both systems. For detailed up-todate information on drugs used during pregnancy and breast feeding,
please see the Supplementary Data/Web version of the guidelines.
Detailed information can also be found on www.ema.europa.eu/,
[www.accessdata.fda.gov, http://www.embryotox.de, or from pre-](http://www.embryotox.de)
scription labels provided by manufacturers.

The previous classification consisted of category A (safest) to X
(known danger: do not use!). The following categories were used for
drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as outlined in the 2011
Guidelines. [9]

Category A: adequate and well-controlled studies have failed to
demonstrate a foetal risk in the first trimester (and there is no evidence of risk in the later trimesters).
Category B: either animal reproduction studies have not demonstrated a foetal risk but there are no controlled studies in pregnant
women, or animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect

that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women.


Category C: either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects

on the foetus and there are no controlled studies in women, or stud
ies in women and animals are not available. Drugs should be given
only if potential benefits justify the potential risk to the foetus.
Category D: there is evidence of human foetal risk, but the benefits
from use in a pregnant woman may be acceptable despite the risk
(e.g. treatment of life-threatening conditions).
Category X: studies in animals or humans have demonstrated foe
tal abnormalities, there is evidence of foetal risk based on human

experience, or both, and the risk of drug use in pregnant women
clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contraindicated in
women who are or may become pregnant.

12.3 Internet databases

The authors of the database [www.embryotox.de](http://www.embryotox.de) of the
Pharmakovigilanz- und Beratungszentrum fu¨r Embryonaltoxikologie
of the Berliner Betrieb fu¨r Zentrale Gesundheitliche Aufgabe base

their recommendations on a combination of scientific sources,

expert opinion that is mainly based on observational data, and personal experiences of women during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

[The English database www.safefetus.com is arranged in a similar](http://www.safefetus.com)

fashion to the German database.

12.4 Pharmaceutical industry
Manufacturers’ instructions are mainly based on the fact that drugs
are not tested sufficiently during pregnancy and breastfeeding. For
this and for legal reasons, drugs are frequently considered prohibited
during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### 13. Gaps in evidence

Epidemiological data
European epidemiological (e.g. registers such as ROPAC) data on
women with CVDs and their outcomes, and the foetal risk during
pregnancy and in the peripartum period, are important sources of

information. However, there is also a clear need for randomized con
trolled trials. In women with specific aortic diseases, the outcome is
not well studied and the impact of treatment with beta-blockers during pregnancy is lacking.
The impact of pregnancy in a woman with congenital or aortic disease on the long-term maternal and foetal outcome is not well

studied.

The impact of fertility treatment on pregnancy complications and

maternal outcomes remains unknown.

Mechanical valve prostheses
In women with mechanical valve prostheses, no prospective studies
are available that compare different anticoagulation regimens. There
are unresolved questions concerning LMWH, including optimal antiXa levels, the importance of peak vs. pre-dose levels, the best time
intervals for anti-Xa monitoring, and the duration of use (first trimester or throughout pregnancy).

Coronary artery disease
In women with CAD, the required delay of a subsequent pregnancy
following MI is unknown. Furthermore, optimal management and
follow-up of patients with P-SCAD is a burning clinical problem. This
includes the decision for interventional therapy as well as counselling
on the recurrence risk for repeated pregnancies.

Drugs
The safety of antiplatelet agents used after PCI in pregnancy is not

well known.

There is a lack of randomized trials on the use of antiarrhythmic
drugs and interventions during pregnancy.
Data based on prospective randomized clinical trials in pregnant
women to assess drug efficacy and safety are very limited. They will
stay limited in some areas due to accepted ethical limitations.
However, greater efforts can be made by prospective registries to
answer burning treatment questions.
Studies investigating the pharmacokinetic changes during pregnancy that modify clinical drug efficacy are required.

Cardiomyopathies
The pathophysiology of PPCM has still to be explored in more detail.
PPCM includes LV dysfunction due to several different causes and
thus PPCM is not a well-described entity. The potential for recovery
is often unclear and the risks of subsequent pregnancies are not well
defined. For acute HF in the context of pregnancy there are almost
no evidence-based treatments. More research is clearly needed.

Cardiac transplantation
Evidence is also limited for pregnancies in patients post-cardiac

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Delivery
Trials evaluating the level of surveillance at delivery and the warranted monitoring level after delivery are needed. Furthermore, the
optimal mode of delivery is not clear for high-risk situations.

Hypertension
It is still unclear whether mild–moderate hypertension in pregnancy
should be pharmacologically treated. The current guidelines are
based on expert consensus regarding thresholds to initiate antihypertensive medication. Prospective studies, even observational, in this

area are needed.

Diagnostic pathways
More data are needed on diagnostic pathways, specifically the place of
D-dimers, in VTE. The value of monitoring anti-Xa values in patients
with VTE (treatment) is unknown. Studies are needed on the benefit
of using the combination of peak and trough levels. The lack of data
regarding the length of anticoagulation after delivery is an unmet need.
### 14. Key messages

 - [Risk estimation should be individualized depending on the under-]
lying cardiac diagnosis, ventricular and valvular function, functional
class, presence of cyanosis, PAPs, and other factors.

 - [Indications for intervention (surgical or catheter) in the]
majority of patients do not differ in women who consider
pregnancy compared with other patients. There are a few
exceptions, such as some degree of aortic dilatation and
severe asymptomatic MS.

 - [In women with a moderate or high-risk of complications during]
pregnancy (mWHO II–III, III, and IV), pre-pregnancy counselling
and management during pregnancy and around delivery should
be performed in an expert centre by a multidisciplinary team: the
pregnancy heart team.

 - [All women with congenital or other possibly genetic heart dis-]
ease should be offered foetal echocardiography in weeks 19–22
of pregnancy.

 - [A delivery plan should be made between 20–30 weeks of preg-]
nancy detailing induction, management of labour, delivery, and
post-partum surveillance.

 - [Induction of labour should be considered at 40 weeks of gesta-]

tion in all women with cardiac disease.

 - [Vaginal delivery is the first choice for the majority of patients.]

 - [Indications for caesarean section are:]

– pre-term labour in patients on OACs

– aggressive aortic pathology

– acute intractable HF

– severe forms of PH (including Eisenmenger’s syndrome)

 - [Pregnancy termination should be discussed if there is a high-risk]
of maternal morbidity or mortality, and/or of foetal abnormality.

 - [Pregnancy, and consequently fertility treatment, is contraindicated]

in women with mWHO class IV.

 - [All patients with known cardiac or aortic disease need investiga-]
tions and counselling about the risks of pregnancy pre-pregnancy
or before assisted reproductive therapy.

 - [The following patients should be counselled against pregnancy:]

– with a Fontan operation and additional comorbidities (ventricular

dysfunction, arrhythmias, or valve regurgitation)


Epidemiological data
European epidemiological (e.g. registers such as ROPAC) data on
women with CVDs and their outcomes, and the foetal risk during
pregnancy and in the peripartum period, are important sources of

information. However, there is also a clear need for randomized con
trolled trials. In women with specific aortic diseases, the outcome is
not well studied and the impact of treatment with beta-blockers during pregnancy is lacking.
The impact of pregnancy in a woman with congenital or aortic disease on the long-term maternal and foetal outcome is not well

studied.

The impact of fertility treatment on pregnancy complications and

maternal outcomes remains unknown.


Mechanical valve prostheses
In women with mechanical valve prostheses, no prospective studies
are available that compare different anticoagulation regimens. There
are unresolved questions concerning LMWH, including optimal antiXa levels, the importance of peak vs. pre-dose levels, the best time
intervals for anti-Xa monitoring, and the duration of use (first trimester or throughout pregnancy).
