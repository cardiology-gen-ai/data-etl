#### **1. Preamble**

Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence, with the aim of as-­
sisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeut-­
ic approach for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines are
intended for use by health professionals and the European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) makes its Guidelines freely available.

ESC Guidelines do not override the individual responsibility of health
professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consider-­
ation of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that pa-­
tient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is
also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and reg-­
ulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of
prescription, and, where appropriate, to respect the ethical rules of
their profession.

ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given
topic and are regularly updated. ESC Policies and Procedures for


formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC web-­
[site (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines).](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)

The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to re-­
present professionals involved with the medical care of patients with
this pathology. The selection procedure aimed to include members
from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC
Subspecialty Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and in-­
clusion, notably with respect to gender and country of origin. The Task
Force performed a critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic ap-­
proaches, including assessment of the risk-benefit ratio. The strength of
every recommendation and the level of evidence supporting them were
weighed and scored according to pre-defined scales as outlined below.
The Task Force followed ESC voting procedures, and all approved re-­
commendations were subject to a vote and achieved at least 75%
agreement among voting members.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration
of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or
potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest
were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and
[can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[Guidelines), and have been compiled in a report published in a supple-­](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
mentary document with the guidelines. The Task Force received its en-­
tire financial support from the ESC without any involvement from the
healthcare industry.

The ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee supervises and
co-ordinates the preparation of new guidelines and is responsible for the
approval process. ESC Guidelines undergo extensive review by the CPG
Committee and external experts, including members from across the
whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty
Communities and National Cardiac Societies. After appropriate revisions,
the guidelines are signed off by all the experts involved in the Task Force.
The finalized document is signed off by the CPG Committee for publica-­
tion in the *European Heart Journal* . The guidelines were developed after
careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evi-­
dence available at the time of their writing. Tables of evidence summarizing
the findings of studies informing development of the guidelines are in-­
cluded. The ESC warns readers that the technical language may be misin-­
terpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect.

Off-label use of medication may be presented in the current
Guidelines if a sufficient level of evidence shows that it can be consid-­
ered medically appropriate for a given condition. However, the final de-­
cisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the
responsible health professional giving special consideration to:

- The specific situation of the patient. Unless otherwise provided for
by national regulations, off-label use of medication should be limited
to situations where it is in the patient’s interest with regard to the
quality, safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has
been informed and has provided consent.

- Country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental
drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which health profes-­
sionals are subject, where applicable.
#### **2. Introduction**

Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular
disease (CVD) with its manifestations of coronary artery disease (CAD),
heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and stroke, as well as aortic and
peripheral artery diseases. In addition, diabetes is a major risk factor for
developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), which in itself is associated

with developing CVD. The combination of diabetes with these
cardio-renal comorbidities enhances the risk not only for cardiovascular
(CV) events but also for CV and all-cause mortality. The current
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines on the management
of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes are designed to guide
prevention and management of the manifestations of CVD in patients
with diabetes based on data published until end of January 2023. Over
the last decade, the results of various large cardiovascular outcome trials
(CVOTs) in patients with diabetes at high CV risk with novel glucoselowering agents, such as sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhi-­
bitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs), but
also novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs),
such as finerenone have substantially expanded available therapeutic op-­
tions, leading to numerous evidence-based recommendations for the
management of this patient population.


The current Guidelines—in contrast to the previous 2019 ESC
Guidelines on diabetes, pre-diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases—
only focus on CVD and diabetes and, given the lack of clear evidence,
leave aside the aspect of pre-diabetes. In addition, this version of the
Guidelines gives recommendations on stratifying CV risk, as well as
on screening, diagnosis, and treatment of CVD in patients with dia-­
betes. For all other aspects concerning the management of patients
with diabetes, we refer to the recommendations from diabetes associa-­
tions, e.g. the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)
or the American Diabetes Association (ADA). [1]

These Guidelines offer evidence-based recommendations to manage
CV risk in patients with diabetes and provide guidance for the treatment
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in patients with dia-­
betes. To individualize treatment strategies, the current Guidelines
introduce a novel, dedicated, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-specific,

**4052** ESC Guidelines


10-year CVD risk score (SCORE2-Diabetes) for patients with T2DM
without ASCVD or severe target-organ damage (TOD). This score,
which now extends the established SCORE2 prediction algorithm for
T2DM, provides data on the 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD
events (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) based on individual patient
characteristics. SCORE2-Diabetes serves as a guide for clinical decisionmaking in patients with T2DM at low, moderate, high, or very high risk,
but without clinically overt ASCVD or severe TOD.

Given the high prevalence of undetected diabetes in patients with CVD,
as well as the elevated risk and therapeutic consequences if both co-­
morbidities co-exist, these Guidelines recommend systematic screening
for diabetes in all patients with CVD. In addition, all patients with diabetes
need to be evaluated for risk and presence of CVD and CKD. Based on
evidence from large CVOTs, the current Guidelines provide clear recom-­
mendations on how to treat patients with diabetes and clinical manifesta-­
tions of cardiovascular-renal disease. As such, in patients with diabetes and
ASCVD, treatment with GLP-1 RAs and/or SGLT2 inhibitors is

**2.1. Central figure**


recommended to reduce CV risk, independent of glucose control and in
addition to standard of care, e.g. antiplatelet, anti-hypertensive, or
lipid-lowering therapy. A special focus of these Guidelines is on managing
HF in diabetes, a field that has been underestimated for years. Based on
data from large CVOTs, it is recommended to treat patients with diabetes
and chronic HF (independent of left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF])
with SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce HF hospitalization. Finally, in patients
with diabetes and CKD, it is recommended to treat with an SGLT2 inhibi-­
tor and/or finerenone, since these agents reduce CV and kidney failure risk
on top of standard of care ( *Figure 1* ).

Managing patients with diabetes and CVD requires an interdisciplin-­
ary approach, which should involve healthcare clinicians from different
disciplines and areas of expertise to support shared decision-making
and implement a personalized treatment strategy to reduce each pa-­
tient’s disease burden. Ultimately, our common goal in managing
CVD in patients with diabetes is to improve patients’ prognosis and
health-related quality of life.

#### **3. Diagnosis of diabetes**

Diabetes mellitus, a common metabolic condition, affected 537 million

individuals worldwide in 2021 (10.5% prevalence), and this is expected
to rise to 783 million cases by 2045 (12.2% prevalence). [2]

Diabetes is suspected in the presence of specific symptoms, includ-­
ing polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, blurred vision, weight loss, poor
wound healing, and recurrent infections. However, the condition
can be asymptomatic and is therefore undiagnosed in over 40% of
adults worldwide (ranging from 24% to 75% across regions). [3]

Abnormal glucose metabolism has been divided into two clinical cat-­
egories: diabetes and pre-diabetes, which are biochemical definitions
(discussed below).

**3.1. Laboratory criteria for diagnosing**
**diabetes and pre-diabetes**
Several biochemical tests are used to diagnose diabetes, including fast-­
ing glucose, 2 h glucose (during the glucose tolerance test), random glu-­
cose, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). [4][–][7]

**3.1.1. Fasting glucose**
Fasting glucose levels ≥7.0 mmol/L (≥126 mg/dL) is diagnostic of dia-­
betes, although two tests are usually recommended to diagnose in
the absence of hyperglycaemic symptoms. In patients with typical symp-­
toms, a single test is adequate, and it should be noted that fasting is de-­
fined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h.

While international guidelines agree on the cut-off value for diagnos-­
ing diabetes, they are divided on the criteria for diagnosing pre-diabetes.
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines pre-diabetes as fasting
glucose levels 6.1–6.9 mmol/L (110–125 mg/dL) with levels
<6.1 mmol/L (<110 mg/dL) regarded as normal. [5] However, the ADA
has more stringent criteria, with glucose levels 5.6–6.9 mmol/L (100–
125 mg/dL) falling into the pre-diabetes range and only those with glu-­
cose <5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) classified as having normal glucose
metabolism. [7][,][8]

**3.1.2. Two-hour oral glucose tolerance test and random**
**glucose**

Following an oral glucose load equivalent to 75 g glucose, 2 h glucose
≥11.1 mmol/L (≥200 mg/dL) is diagnostic of diabetes. Two-hour glu-­
cose 7.8–11.0 mmol/L (140–199 mg/dL) indicates impaired glucose tol-­
erance, and the individual is diagnosed with pre-diabetes. However, an
oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is not routinely performed, as it is
time-consuming and inconvenient, and is therefore usually reserved for
unclear cases. Of note, OGTT should be performed under resting con-­
ditions, as exercise during the test can invalidate the results.

**4058** ESC Guidelines


Following on, a random glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (≥200 mg/dL) is also
diagnostic of diabetes in the presence of symptoms. In the absence of
symptoms, two random glucose levels ≥11.1 mmol/L (≥200 mg/dL)
are required to diagnose diabetes. One-hour OGTT ≥8.6 mmol/L
(≥155 mg/dL) has been suggested as a better predictor of diabetes
than 2 h OGTT ≥11.1 mmol/L (≥200 mg/dL), and is associated with
vascular complications and mortality. [9] However, further validation is
required before this new measure is widely adopted.

**3.1.3. Glycated haemoglobin**

Following high-quality epidemiological studies, it was suggested that
HbA1c could be used to diagnose diabetes, and this was subsequently
endorsed by international guidelines. [10] It should be noted that epi-­
demiological studies have relied on the adult population, though
HbA1c is also used in younger individuals as a diagnostic test. [11]

Advantages of HbA1c include ease of measurement, limited
within-individual variability, and the convenience of anytime testing
without the need for fasting or a cumbersome OGTT.

However, HbA1c is not accurate in specific groups where the rela-­
tionship between HbA1c and glucose levels is altered for any reason
[(Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S1* ). [12][,][13] Moreover, in cases of short-­
er diabetes duration, such as early type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or

ESC Guidelines **4059**


acute pancreatic damage, HbA1c can lead to false-negative results.
Another practical limitation is the lack of test availability in some parts
of the world due to financial constraints.

Guidelines agree that HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol (≥6.5%) is diagnostic of
diabetes, while the diagnosis of pre-diabetes uses two different cut-off
values. The WHO criteria define pre-diabetes as HbA1c 42–47 mmol/
mol (6.0–6.4%), while the ADA recommends a wider range of 39–
47 mmol/mol (5.7–6.4%). [5][,][7] Notably, the combination of HbA1c and
fasting glucose in the diabetes range is diagnostic of diabetes and a se-­
cond test is not required, even if the individual is asymptomatic.
However, if the two are discordant, the number in the diabetes range
should be repeated or, preferably, an OGTT performed, which remains
the gold standard for diagnosing diabetes in unclear cases. The criteria
used for diagnosing diabetes and pre-diabetes are summarized in
*Table 6* . It should be noted that data from 73 studies on 294 998 indi-­
viduals without known diabetes suggest that HbA1c is as good as or
better than fasting, random, or post-load glucose levels for predicting
CV risk. [14]

A diagram for the diagnosis of diabetes is shown in *Figure 2* .

**3.2. Classifying diabetes**
After abnormal glucose metabolism is diagnosed, the next step is to as-­
certain the type of diabetes in order to start the appropriate therapies
[(Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S2* ).

**3.2.1. Type 1 diabetes**

Type 1 diabetes constitutes 5–10% of individuals with diabetes and is
secondary to destruction of pancreatic β-cells by an autoimmune pro-­
cess, with subsequent insulin deficiency. Recent guidance on diagnosing
T1DM has been published. [13]

Briefly, individuals aged <35 years presenting with diabetes should be
suspected of having T1DM, although this condition can occur at any
age. A short history of osmotic symptoms accompanied by weight
loss and raised glucose levels in a younger individual is highly suggestive
of T1DM. Antibody testing helps to confirm the diagnosis, although this
can be negative in 5–10% of individuals with T1DM, while C-peptide
helps to assess endogenous insulin production in unclear cases
[(Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S2* ).

Pancreatic β-cell function can partially recover after the diagnosis of
T1DM, and this can last several years, often referred to as the ‘honey-­
moon period’. However, if this persists beyond 5 years, an alternative
type of diabetes needs to be considered. [15] Of importance, the combin-­
ation of T1DM with insulin resistance, which can be referred to as dou-­
ble diabetes (DD), increases the risk of vascular complications, although
the exact definition of DD is yet to be determined. [16]

**3.2.2. Type 2 diabetes**
Type 2 diabetes is the most common cause of diabetes (90% of the dia-­
betes population) and is usually caused by insulin resistance coupled
with ‘relative’ insulin deficiency, resulting in raised glucose levels.
Individuals with T2DM can be asymptomatic and can be diagnosed after
[presenting with CV complications (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)
*[Table S2](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)* ). Therefore, it is mandatory to screen all patients with CVD
for the presence of diabetes.

**3.2.3. Monogenic diabetes**

This comprises many mutations that cause glucose mishandling. A full
description can be found elsewhere. [17] Briefly, monogenic diabetes


should be suspected in the presence of a strong family history of abnor-­
mal glucose metabolism in an autosomal dominant manner (i.e. succes-­
sive generations with diabetes at a young age). [17]

Patients diagnosed with diabetes before the age of 6 months and
those not fitting the T1DM or T2DM profiles should be suspected of
having monogenic diabetes.

**3.2.4. Secondary diabetes and stress hyperglycaemia**

Diabetes can occur secondary to various conditions and therapies
[(Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S2* ). Stress hyperglycaemia is not un-­
common in hospitalized patients and can occur in individuals with acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) or HF. [18] Stress hyperglycaemia without dia-­
betes is associated with adverse in-hospital outcomes, and should be
suspected in those with raised glucose levels during admission and nor-­
mal HbA1c. [19] Such individuals are best investigated using OGTT a few
weeks after discharge to rule out diabetes or impaired glucose toler-­
ance. Some studies suggest performing OGTT before hospital dis-­
charge but robust data supporting this approach are lacking. [20][,][21]

**3.2.5. Gestational diabetes**

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as diabetes diagnosed
in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not overt dia-­
betes before gestation. [7] While there is still no worldwide consensus
regarding the best testing strategy, the ‘one-step’ 75 g OGTT, also
recommended by the WHO, is the preferred test in many coun-­
tries. [22] In women with GDM, repeat testing is required in the postpartum period to rule out persistent abnormal glucose metabolism.
Women with GDM will require lifelong annual diabetes screening gi-­
ven the high risk of developing diabetes. [23][–][25] Also, evidence suggests
that women with a history of GDM are at increased CV risk, even
with normal post-partum glucose levels. Given that GDM is an im-­
portant precursor of future cardiometabolic complications, women
with a history of GDM should regularly be screened not only for dia-­
betes, but also for CV health. [26][–][29]

**3.2.6. Further sub-group classification of type 2**
**diabetes**

For information regarding further sub-group classification of T2DM,
[see Supplementary data online](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *, Section 1.1.1* .

**3.3. Screening for diabetes**
Criteria for diabetes testing differ widely across regions, and a com-­
prehensive global screening programme is yet to be developed. It is
generally agreed, however, that individuals in high-risk groups (those
living with overweight or obesity, or having markers of insulin resist-­
ance, such as acanthosis nigricans or fatty liver disease) should be
regularly screened, particularly after age 45 years. The ADA devel-­
oped a relatively simple 7-point scoring system based on age, sex,
weight, physical activity (PA), history of GDM, presence of hyperten-­
sion, and family history of diabetes; it is advised that those scoring ≥5
are screened for diabetes. [7]

The prevalence of diabetes is increased among patients with CVD,
with 23–37% of patients with ACS and 10–47% of patients with HF di-­
agnosed with diabetes. This results in worse clinical outcomes com-­
pared with individuals with normal glucose metabolism. [30][–][33]

Therefore, individuals with ASCVD and/or HF and/or AF, particularly
those admitted to hospital with an acute event, should be tested for dia-­
betes; those with suspected stress hyperglycaemia (raised glucose levels

**4060** ESC Guidelines


during admission with normal HbA1c) should undergo post-discharge
glucose testing, preferably with OGTT, to rule out persistent abnormal
glucose metabolism.

Although OGTT has been previously advocated for diabetes screen-­
ing in individuals with CVD, practicalities and low reproducibility of the
test limited widespread use. [34][,][35] Importantly, evidence indicates that
HbA1c, or fasting glucose, are stronger predictors of vascular complica-­
tions than 2 h OGTT and it is therefore best to adopt these simple
measures for general screening, particularly given their high reproduci-­
bility. [35][–][38]

#### **4. Cardiovascular risk assessment ** **in patients with type 2 diabetes**

Individuals with T2DM are at a two- to four-fold higher risk of develop-­
ing CVD during their lifetime alongside its manifestations CAD, stroke,
HF, and AF, as well as peripheral artery diseases (PAD). [40][,][41] In addition,
many patients with CVD have undiagnosed T2DM. Given that having
diabetes and CVD, especially at a younger age, has a major impact on
prognosis, it is of utmost importance to screen patients with CVD
for diabetes and to assess CV risk in individuals with diabetes, and evalu-­
ate them for CV and kidney disease. [42]

**4.1. Assessing cardiovascular risk in type 2**
**diabetes**

When assessing CV risk in individuals with T2DM, it is important to
consider medical and family history, symptoms, findings from examin-­
ation, laboratory and other diagnostic test results, and the presence
of ASCVD or severe TOD. There is not enough robust evidence to
suggest that assessment of coronary artery calcium (CAC) or intima
media thickness help reclassify CV risk in people with T2DM. Severe
TOD is defined as:

(i) Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <45 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ]

irrespective of albuminuria, or
(ii) eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ] and microalbuminuria (urinary
albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] 30–300 mg/g; stage A2), or
(iii) Proteinuria (UACR >300 mg/g; stage A3), or
(iv) Presence of microvascular disease in at least three different sites
(e.g. microalbuminuria (stage A2) plus retinopathy plus neur-­
opathy; see *Section 9.1* for CKD screening). [43][–][45]

different sites [e.g. microalbuminuria (stage A2) plus retinopathy plus neuropathy]. [43][–][45]

**4.1.2. SCORE2-Diabetes: estimating 10-year**
**cardiovascular disease risk**

In patients aged ≥40 years with T2DM without ASCVD or severe TOD,
it is recommended to estimate 10-year CVD risk using the
SCORE2-Diabetes algorithm ( *Figure 3* ). In these patients, risk factors
for ASCVD should be evaluated on an individual basis. In the 2021

ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice,
the ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular disease: preterAx and
diamicroN MR Controlled Evaluation) or DIAL (Diabetes lifetimeperspective prediction) models were suggested for estimating CVD
risk among patients with diabetes. [46][–][48] However, these models have
some limitations for use in Europe, as they do not allow for substantial
variations of risk across countries, meaning they may misestimate risk
in these circumstances. Furthermore, these models have been developed
from a narrow set of studies and have not been systematically ‘recali-­
brated’ (i.e. statistically adapted) to contemporary CVD rates, meaning
they are not ideal for use in contemporary European populations. To ad-­
dress these limitations, the current Guidelines recommend use of the
SCORE2-Diabetes model, which extends the regionally recalibrated
European SCORE2 10-year risk model to enable use in individuals with
T2DM aged 40–69 years without ASCVD or severe TOD, and to esti-­
mate an individual’s 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events (MI,
stroke). [49]

SCORE2-Diabetes integrates information on conventional CVD risk
factors (i.e. age, smoking status, systolic blood pressure [SBP], and total
and high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol) with diabetes-specific
information (e.g. age at diabetes diagnosis, HbA1c, and eGFR). [50] This
model is calibrated to four clusters of countries (low, moderate, high,
and very high CVD risk) using the similar methodology of the

ESC Guidelines **4061**

opathy]. [43][–][45][ b] The thresholds (10-year CVD risk) suggested are not definitive but rather designed to prompt joint decision-making conversations with pa-­
tients about intensity of treatment, as well as additional interventions. SCORE2-Diabetes refers to patients aged ≥40 years.

The ESC CVD Risk Calculation App includes SCORE2-Diabetes to
facilitate risk estimation and communication between health profes-­
[sionals and individuals with T2DM (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Tables*
*[S4–6](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)* ).

Additional risk scores that attempt to estimate lifetime risk in indivi-­
duals with diabetes (such as the DIAL2 [DIAbetes Lifetime] model,
which is calibrated to different European countries) can also be used
to aid treatment decisions. [52] However, estimation of lifetime risk
should be adapted as new methods become available in the future.

Thresholds for the different risk categories are shown in *Table 7* and
*Figure 3.* In general, no risk threshold is universally applicable, and the
risk thresholds suggested in these Guidelines for use with
SCORE2-Diabetes should be used to help guide clinicians and patients
to prompt joint decision-making conversations for considering the in-­
tensity of treatment and additional interventions to prevent ASCVD
(such as lipid-lowering therapies [ *Section 5.5* ] or SGLT2 inhibitors
and/or GLP-1 RAs [ *Section 5.3* ]). However, 10-year risk thresholds
are for guidance only and other patient characteristics may lead to de-­
cisions to treat or not treat irrespective of such thresholds.

#### **5. Cardiovascular risk reduction in ** **patients with diabetes: targets and ** **treatments**

**5.1. Lifestyle and diabetes**
Lifestyle changes are recommended as the basic measure for preventing
and managing T2DM. [48] Advice should be addressed by a multifactorial
approach with patient-centred communication adapted to the health
status and health literacy of the patient ( *Section 5.7* ). In T2DM, as inves-­
tigated in the Action for Health in Diabetes trial (Look AHEAD; 5145
T2DM patients, 59% female, mean age 58 years, mean body mass index

[BMI] 36 kg/m [2] ), lifestyle intervention by nutritional counselling, meal
replacement, and exercise induced an average of 8.6% weight loss,
which was associated with a significant reduction in HbA1c and BP. [56]

Effects on weight and risk-factor control diminished after 5 years in
those with low adherence to the lifestyle programme. [56] After 10 years,
CV events (i.e. a composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for angina) were not different to usual

care. [56] However, microvascular disease complications (i.e. develop-­
ment of CKD) were significantly reduced (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55–0.87; *P* = 0.002) by lifestyle interven-­
tion, an effect associated with improvements in CV risk factors. [57]

Additional analyses 16.7 years after the start of the study (9.6 years
of intervention and then observation) revealed that participants who
lost ≥10% of weight at 1 year of intervention had a 21% reduced risk
of mortality (HR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.94; *P* = 0.007). [58] The decline in
body fat mass was significantly associated with a lower risk of HF
with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and HF with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF), while a decline in waist circumference was only signifi-­
cantly associated with a lower risk of HFpEF. [59] In addition, baseline
cardio-pulmonary fitness was associated with reduced risks of mortality
and CV events during follow-up of 9.2 years. [60]

The DiRECT (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial)—an open-label,
cluster-randomized trial in patients with T2DM—assigned practices
to provide either a weight-management programme including exercise
(intervention group) or best-practice care by guidelines (control
group). At 12 months, almost half of the participants in the intervention
group achieved remission to a non-diabetic state and were off glucoselowering drugs. [61] Home-based exercise intervention in patients with
CAD and T2DM (ARTEMIS study; Finnish randomized controlled trial

[RCT]; *n* = 127; 2-year controlled, home-based exercise training vs.
usual care), however, did not significantly improve CV risk factors des-­
pite significant improvements in exercise capacity ( *P* = 0.030). [62]

**5.1.1. Weight reduction**
In patients with obesity and T2DM, reducing weight is one of the cor-­
nerstones of treatment. [63] Weight loss of >5% improves glycaemic con-­
trol, lipid levels, and BP in overweight and obese adults with T2DM. [64][,][65]

These effects can be achieved by improving energy balance and/or
introducing obesity medications. Orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion, and
phentermine/topiramate are each associated with achieving >5%
weight loss at 52 weeks compared with placebo. [66] However, glucoselowering agents such as GLP-1 RAs, the dual agonist tirzepatide, and
SGLT2 inhibitors also significantly reduce body weight. [67][,][68] Adding ex-­
ercise to a GLP-1 RA (liraglutide) had a greater effect on weight reduc-­
tion and maintenance. [69] Comparing the effects on weight reduction
between GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors, the former seems to be su-­
perior. Given the additional beneficial effects of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2
inhibitors on CV outcomes in T2DM ( *Section 5.3* ), these agents should
be the preferred glucose-lowering medication in overweight and obese
patients with CVD and T2DM, as obesity medications have, to date, not
shown to reduce CV events. [70][–][72]

If weight is not managed effectively by lifestyle interventions and
medication, bariatric surgery should be considered in patients with
T2DM and a BMI ≥35 kg/m [2 ] (≥Class II; WHO classification) to achieve
long-term weight loss, reduce blood glucose, and improve CV risk fac-­
tors. Data from the Swedish Obesity Subjects (SOS) study revealed
that after 24-year follow-up, bariatric surgery was associated with a
prolonged life expectancy compared with lifestyle and intensive medical
management alone. [73][,][74] The corresponding HR was 0.70 (95% CI,
0.57–0.85) for CV death and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.61–0.96) for death
from cancer. [75][,][76] This evidence has been extended to patients with
CVD and obesity, as a large case-control study ( *n* = 2638) revealed
that bariatric surgery was also associated with a lower incidence of ma-­
jor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in those patients. [77] Still, po-­
tential adverse events after bariatric surgery should also be
considered. [78]

**5.1.2. Change in diet or nutrition**
In general, patients with T2DM should follow nutritional recommenda-­
tions that reduce body weight and improve metabolic control and out-­
comes. [48] A Mediterranean-style eating pattern improves glycaemic
control, lipids, and BP. [80][,][81] If this diet is supplemented with olive oil or
nuts, as in the non-randomized PREvencion con Dieta MEDiterranea

(PREDIMED) study in individuals at high CV risk (49% T2DM), the risk
of ASCVD was reduced by 28–31%. [82] Recent data from the Coronary

Diet Intervention With Olive Oil and Cardiovascular Prevention

(CORDIOPREV) study confirmed the benefit of a Mediterranean diet
by showing that male patients with established CAD benefitted more
from a Mediterranean diet than from a low-fat diet intervention after

7 years of follow-up. A shift from a more animal-based to a plant-based
food pattern may also reduce ASCVD risk. [83][–][85]

Data from studies on supplementation with n–3 fatty acids do not
support recommending n–3 fatty acid supplements for secondary pre-­
vention of CVD in T2DM. [86][,][87] The consumption of sugars,
sugar-sweetened soft drinks, and fruit juices should be avoided. [88][,][89]

Moreover, alcohol intake should generally be moderate, as any amount
of alcohol uniformly increases BP and BMI. [90][–][92] A high-protein diet
(30% protein, 40% carbohydrates, and 30% fat) seems to be superior
to a standard-protein diet (15% protein, 55% carbohydrates, and
30% fat) in overweight and obese (mean weight 107.8 ± 20.8 kg) pa-­
tients with HF; both diets were equal in reducing body weight (3.6 vs.
2.9 kg, respectively) and waist circumference (1.9 vs. 1.3 cm, respective-­
ly), but the high-protein diet resulted in greater reductions in CV risk
factors, e.g. HbA1c, cholesterol, triglycerides, and BP. [93]

People with CVD and T2DM are encouraged to reduce sodium in-­
take, as this may reduce systolic BP by, on average, 5.8 mmHg in hyper-­
tensive patients and 1.9 mmHg in normotensive patients. [94][,][95] In a
meta-analysis, in hypertensive and normotensive people, reducing salt
intake by 2.5 g/day resulted in a 20% relative reduction of ASCVD
events. [95] In addition, salt substitution with reduced sodium levels and

increased potassium levels has been shown to reduce stroke, CVD,
and overall mortality in patients with high CV risk. [96]

**5.1.3. Increasing physical activity and exercise**

Regular moderate to vigorous PA has favourable effects on metabolic
control and CV risk factors in T2DM. [97][–][100] Intervention programmes
reduce HbA1c by 0.6% in patients with T2DM, with the combination
of endurance and resistance exercise having the most beneficial ef-­
fects. [101] Moreover, compared with low total PA, high total PA is asso-­
ciated with a lower CV mortality risk, as well as a reduction in all-cause
mortality (all-cause mortality: HR 0.60 [95% CI, 0.49–0.73], comparing
high vs. low total PA). [97]

Structured exercise intervention is also recommended in patients with
T2DM with established CVD (e.g. CAD, AF, HFpEF; heart failure with
mildly reduced ejection fraction [HFmrEF]; HFrEF). [102][–][104] Interval endur-­
ance exercise training of more vigorous intensity (e.g. interval walking, al-­
ternating between moderate to vigorous intensities) has superior effects
compared with moderate-intensity continuous walking regarding body
weight, waist circumference, and glucose control. [105] Before starting a
structured exercise programme in patients with T2DM and established
CVD, performing a maximal exercise stress test to assess CV pathologies
should be considered. Moreover, assessment of aerobic and anaerobic
thresholds by spiroergometry is particularly useful to provide an indivi-­
dualized endurance exercise prescription including exercise inten-­
sity. [106][–][108] Optimal intensity is determined based on an individual’s
maximum (peak) effort during spiroergometry, e.g. percentage of cardio-­
respiratory fitness (% peak oxygen consumption), percentage of
maximum (peak) heart rate (% HR max ), or perceived exertion rate ac-­
cording to the Borg scale. [107][–][109] Exercise prescription is recommended
to be adapted to T2DM-associated comorbidities, e.g. CAD, HF, AF, dia-­
betic peripheral neuropathy, or retinopathy, as well as age and
frailty. [104][,][107][,][108] Resistance exercise is recommended to be performed
at least twice weekly (intensity of 60–80% of the individual’s
one-repetition maximum). For older or deconditioned adults, less vol-­
ume and lower intensities are recommended, particularly during the ini-­
tiation phase of 3–6 weeks. [106]

Interventions are based on encouraging an increase in any PA, as
even small amounts were shown to have beneficial effects; even an ex-­
tra 1000 steps of walking per day is advantageous and may be a good
starting point for many patients. [98][,][100] Moreover, a gradual increase in
activity level is recommended. Structured exercise should be addition-­
ally introduced at the start or after first achievements to increase activ-­
ity. Patients should perform ≥2 sessions per week of endurance
exercise and/or resistance exercise training. PA accumulated in bouts
of even <10 min is associated with favourable outcomes, including re-­
duced mortality. [110][,][111]

Interventions shown to increase PA level or reduce sedentary behav-­
iour include behaviour theory-based interventions, such as goal-setting,
re-evaluation of goals, self-monitoring, and feedback. [112][,][113] Using a
wearable activity tracker (e.g. smartphones) may help increase PA. [114]

Most important is to encourage PA that people enjoy and/or can

**5.1.4. Smoking cessation**

Smoking cessation is a key lifestyle intervention in patients with T2DM
with or without CVD with evidence suggesting a 36% reduction in mor-­
tality in CVD patients. [118][–][120] If advice, encouragement, and motivation
are insufficient, then drug therapies should be considered early, includ-­
ing nicotine replacement therapy (chewing gum, transdermal nicotine
patches, nasal spray, inhaler, sublingual tablets) followed by bupro-­
pion. [121] In patients with ASCVD, varenicline, bupropion, telephone
therapy, and individual counselling all increase success rates. [122]

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been addressed as a potential
smoking cessation aid to bridge transition from smoking to abstention,
but—if used at all—should be limited for a short period of time. A con-­
sensus regarding the efficacy and safety for this approach has yet to be
reached. [123][,][124] Overall, smoking cessation programmes have low effi-­
cacy at 12 months; nonetheless, cessation measures should be repeti-­
tively addressed for smoking abstention to succeed. [125]

**5.2. Glycaemic targets**
**5.2.1. Role of glycated haemoglobin**

Reducing HbA1c decreases microvascular complications, particularly
when achieving near-normal levels (HbA1c <7%, <53 mmol/mol),
but the effects on macrovascular disease are more complex. [126][–][129]

The DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) in T1DM
and the UKPDS (United Kindom Prospective Diabetes Study) in new-­
ly diagnosed T2DM have shown that reducing HbA1c decreases longterm macrovascular events without having a significant effect in the
medium term of 6.5–10.0 years. [130][–][132] Other studies, such as
ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and
Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation), ACCORD (Action to
Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), and VADT (Veterans
Affairs Diabetes Trial), including higher-risk T2DM cohorts, have simi-­
larly failed to show an effect for intensive glycaemic control on short/
medium-term macrovascular risk (over 3.5–5.6 years). Meta-analyses
of the UKPDS, ADVANCE, ACCORD, and VADT studies, including
27 049 participants, have demonstrated that lowering HbA1c reduces
MACE, driven by a reduction in MI (HF and stroke risk were unaffect-­
ed), and decreases microvascular complications (renal and retinal but
not neuropathy). [133][,][134]

Of interest, the ACCORD trial, with 35% of participants having a
previous CV event, showed increased mortality (HR 1.22; 95% CI,
1.01–1.46; *P* = 0.04) in the intensive glycaemic arm (HbA1c 6.5%,
48 mmol/mol) compared with controls. [129] Also, observational studies
have shown a U-shaped relationship between HbA1c and clinical out-­
come, suggesting that lower HbA1c is not always better. [135][,][136]

**5.2.2. Additional glycaemic targets**

Hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk of vascular events,
explaining recent consensus advocating hypoglycaemic exposure at
<1% (i.e. <15 min/day) in individuals at high CV risk. [137][,][138] A causal re-­
lationship between hypoglycaemia and adverse outcomes is not always
clear as low glucose levels can be a marker of ill health. [139][,][140]


In addition to hypoglycaemia, glycaemic variability is emerging as a
potential vascular risk factor, but studies are limited and more research

in this area is warranted.

Post-prandial glucose has been suggested to independently
predict vascular disease, even in individuals without a previous history
of diabetes. [141] However, manipulating prandial glucose levels failed to
impact clinical outcome, and therefore, this remains an unresolved
area. [142][,][143]

**5.2.3. Glycaemic control following vascular events**
Hyperglycaemia following ACS is associated with worse clinical out-­
come. [144] The DIGAMI 1 (Diabetes Mellitus Insulin-Glucose Infusion
in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial demonstrated reduced mortal-­
ity with intensive glucose control post-ACS, but DIGAMI 2, which
was underpowered, failed to confirm these findings. [145][,][146]

Unexpectedly, DIGAMI 2 showed a numerical increase in mortality
in the intervention arm, particularly in insulin-treated patients, sug-­
gesting an adverse role for hypoglycaemia in this population. [147]

Therefore, large-scale glycaemic studies are required, using continu-­
ous glucose monitoring (CGM) to assess glucose levels, to establish
whether optimizing glycaemia in patients with CVD and diabetes
improves clinical outcome.

In summary, glucose control in individuals with diabetes at high CV
risk is a complex area and current evidence indicates the need to ad-­
dress multiple glycaemic measures, including personalizing HbA1c tar-­
gets, minimizing hypoglycaemic exposure, and limiting glucose
variability. *Figure 4* provides a simple guide to glycaemic control in pa-­
tients with T2DM and CVD.

**5.3. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease**

**risk reduction by glucose-lowering**
**medications in diabetes**

T2DM is common among patients with ASCVD or at the highest risk of
CVD. The converse is also true: ASCVD is common in patients with
T2DM. [148] Given these relationships, it is key to consider the presence
of T2DM when deciding strategies to mitigate CV risk. It is imperative
that the first step in this process is to screen all patients with CVD for
T2DM. Many decisions are independent of glucose management, there-­
fore, T2DM status can inform clinical decision-making for mitigating CV
risk, as discussed for several other interventions in the current
Guidelines. [149] Capitalizing on the results of multiple dedicated CVOTs
of glucose-lowering medications in patients with diabetes and ASCVD
or at high CV risk, there is now a wealth of data to inform the preferential
use of selected glucose-lowering medications to reduce CV risk, inde-­
pendent of glucose management considerations. Glucose-lowering med-­
ications can be prescribed with two parallel, mutually exclusive intentions:
(i) to improve CV outcomes and safety; and (ii) to control glucose. On this
basis, in the current Guidelines, we have separated prescribing recom-­
mendations into those intended to improve CV outcomes and those in-­
tended to control glucose. Underpinning these recommendations are
results from the key CVOTs delineating the efficacy and safety of glucoselowering therapies for treating T2DM and their effect on CV outcomes.

A meta-analysis of the six SGLT2 inhibitor trials demonstrated a re-­
duction in the primary ASCVD-based composite of time to first event
of CV death, MI, or stroke (MACE). This was most apparent in patients
with established ASCVD ( *Figure 5* ). [155] Of note, neither dapagliflozin nor

ertugliflozin reduced the risk of MACE, but both reduced risk of HF
hospitalization, with consistency across the class for HF benefits
( *Section 7* ). Based on these aggregate results, along with the GLP-1
RAs (see below), SGLT2 inhibitors are a preferred glucose-lowering
therapy for patients with T2DM with ASCVD, independent of glucose
control considerations, and independent of background metformin use.

Results from the meta-analysis demonstrated no statistically signifi-­
cant benefit for risk of MACE in the subsets of patients without
ASCVD but with multiple ASCVD risk factors; yet the point estimate
remains favourable in this subset, with no significant interaction by
ASCVD status ( *P* = 0.63; *Figure 5* ). In patients with T2DM without
ASCVD or severe TOD but with a calculated 10-year CVD risk
≥10% in the SCORE2-Diabetes algorithm ( *Section 4.1* ), treatment


with SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs may be considered to re-­
duce CV risk, independent of glucose control considerations. This

recommendation is a consensus within the Task Force based on the

assumption that some level of predicted CVD risk appears to be
equivalent to ‘severe TOD risk’, acknowledging it is a Level C recom-­
mendation. Of note, it is in line with recommendations from EASD
and ADA. [1][,][156][,][157]

safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2DM with or at high
risk of ASCVD. These trials comprise the ELIXA (Evaluation of

MI, and stroke compared with placebo. A meta-analysis of seven of the
eight completed GLP-1 RA trials, excluding the ELIXA trial results (due
to a very short pharmacodynamic half-life [3 h] of once a day [o.d.] lix-­
isenatide, and the very high-risk population post-ACS differentiating it
from all others), showed that a pooled estimate for GLP-1 RA vs. pla-­
cebo for the primary outcome was reduced by 15% (HR 0.85; 95% CI,
0.80–0.90; *Figure 6* ). [164] Results from pooled analyses of the effects of
GLP-1 RA vs. placebo on individual CV outcomes included CV death
(HR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.93), MI (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81–0.96), stroke
(HR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74–0.90), and hospitalization for HF (HR 0.88; 95%
CI, 0.79–0.98). Notably, the point estimate in the seven trials was lower
(HR = 0.85) in those with established ASCVD than in those without
(HR = 0.94), with *P* int = 0.068, suggesting but not conclusively proving
that GLP-1 RAs may reduce risks more in those with established
ASCVD. As absolute risks are greater in those with established CV dis-­
ease, the absolute benefits are also expected to be greater.

Based on these aggregate results, along with the SGLT2 inhibitors (see
above) GLP-1 RAs are a preferred glucose-lowering therapy for patients
with T2DM and ASCVD, independent of glucose control considera-­
tions, and independent of background metformin use. In patients with
T2DM without ASCVD or severe TOD, but with a calculated 10-year
CVD risk ≥10% in the SCORE2-Diabetes algorithm ( *Section 4* ), treat-­
ment with GLP-1 RAs and/or SGLT2 inhibitors may be considered to re-­
duce CV risk, independent of glucose control considerations. This
recommendation is a consensus within the Task Force based on the as-­
sumption that some level of predicted CVD risk appears to be equivalent
to ‘severe TOD risk’, acknowledging it is a Level C recommendation. Of
note, it is in line with recommendations from EASD and ADA. [1][,][156][,][157]

*5.3.1.3. Pioglitazone*

The PROactive (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in
Macrovascular Events) randomized CVOT assessed the CV effects
of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) pioglitazone vs. placebo, independent
of glucose control, in patients with T2DM and ASCVD. It failed to
achieve statistical significance for its primary composite outcome of
all-cause death, MI, stroke, unstable angina, coronary or peripheral re-­
vascularization, and amputation (HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.80–1.02). [165]

However, for the principal secondary outcome evaluating the goldstandard, three-point composite outcome of CV death, MI, and
stroke, there was a nominally significant 16% relative risk (RR) reduc-­
tion (HR 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.98). [165]

Results from subsequent meta-analyses and observational studies
have supported the suggested efficacy of pioglitazone in persons with
ASCVD. [166][–][169] Notably, the magnitude of the estimated treatment
benefit with pioglitazone across these studies aligns with contemporary
meta-analyses estimates of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1
RAs on the same composite MACE outcome. [155][,][164]

TZDs enhance fluid retention and the risk of peripheral oedema, es-­
pecially with concomitant insulin use and in the context of kidney dys-­
function. In addition, TZDs increase the risk of HF, with the incremental
risk of HF with pioglitazone at an estimated 0.4% annualized, absolute
increase. [170] HF associated with TZDs appears to be attributable to ex-­
panded plasma volume, with no evidence of myocardial toxicity. [171]

TZDs induce weight gain due to adipose tissue expansion, but with
weight redistributed predominantly to less metabolically active adipose
tissue; weight gain may be the greatest concern of patients and clinicians
with the TZD class. Based on the data and net benefit-risk assessment,


it is reasonable to consider using pioglitazone to mitigate ASCVD risk in
patients with T2DM and prevalent ASCVD.

*5.3.2.1. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors*

Five randomized CV safety trials in populations with T2DM with or at
high risk of ASCVD have assessed the CV effects of dipeptidyl
[peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S9* ):
saxagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin, and linagliptin each vs. placebo, and li-­
nagliptin vs. glimepiride. [172][–][175] All four of the placebo-controlled trials
demonstrated statistical non-inferiority but not superiority for the
DPP-4 inhibitors in the primary MACE endpoint. In the SAVOR-TIMI
53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in
Patients with Diabetes Mellitus—Thrombolysis in Myocardial
Infarction 53) trial, saxagliptin statistically significantly increased the
risk of hospitalization for HF vs. placebo. [176] Numerically, more HF
events occurred with alogliptin vs. placebo in the EXAMINE
(Cardiovascular Outcomes Study of Alogliptin in Patients With Type
2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial, though this difference
was not nominally significant. [177]

These observations led to the development and regulatory filing of
prospective HF analysis plans for the TECOS (Trial Evaluating
Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin) and CARMELINA
(Cardiovascular and Renal Microvascular Outcome Study With
Linagliptin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) trials, each of
which revealed no increased risk of HF with either sitagliptin or linaglip-­
tin compared with placebo. [178][,][179] In the CAROLINA (Cardiovascular
Outcome Study of Linagliptin Versus Glimepiride in Patients With
Type 2 Diabetes) trial, linagliptin was compared with the active com-­
parator glimepiride, demonstrating no difference in any assessed CV
or kidney outcome, though noting a higher risk of hypoglycaemia
with glimepiride. [180]

*5.3.2.2. Lixisenatide and exenatide*

Of the eight GLP-1 RAs evaluated in CVOTs, two have demonstrated
safety but not incremental efficacy. In the ELIXA trial, lixisenatide 10 or
20 μg o.d. was non-inferior to placebo, but did not significantly affect a
four-point MACE (three-point MACE plus hospitalization for unstable
angina) in patients with T2DM post-ACS. [158] In the EXSCEL trial of pa-­
tients with T2DM in whom 73% had experienced a previous CV event,
exenatide extended-release 2 mg once weekly showed non-inferiority
but not superiority to placebo for the primary outcome of CV death,
MI, and stroke. [159]

*5.3.2.3. Insulin*

Two basal insulins have been formally evaluated in dedicated CVOTs. In
the ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention)
trial, 12 537 patients (mean age 63.5 years) at high CVD risk with im-­
paired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or
T2DM were randomized to insulin glargine titrated to a fasting blood
glucose level of ≤5.3 mmol/L (≤95 mg/dL) or standard care. [86] After a
median follow-up of 6.2 years, the incidence of CV outcomes did not
differ between the two groups.

ESC Guidelines **4069**


The DEVOTE (A Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Insulin
Degludec Versus Insulin Glargine in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes
at High Risk of Cardiovascular Events) trial, a randomized, double-blind
comparison of the ultra-long-acting, o.d. insulin degludec vs. insulin glar-­
gine U100, enrolled 7637 patients with T2DM with ASCVD or at high
CV risk. [181] Over a median follow-up of 1.8 years, there was no signifi-­
cant difference in the primary composite of CV death, non-fatal MI, or
non-fatal stroke between groups. A significantly lower frequency of
hypoglycaemia was observed in the degludec arm compared with the
glargine arm. [181]

*5.3.2.4. Glimepiride*
Based on the findings of statistical non-inferiority of linagliptin vs. pla-­
cebo in CARMELINA coupled with the non-inferiority of linagliptin
vs. glimepiride demonstrated in CAROLINA, one might conclude
that glimepiride is most likely not different from placebo with regards
to CV safety. [180] Thus, the long-lasting uncertainty about the CV safety
of sulphonylureas may no longer be clinically relevant for glimeperide, at
least in patients with a shorter duration of diabetes like those enrolled
in the CAROLINA trial (median duration of T2DM ∼6 years). [182]

**5.3.3. Cardiovascular considerations of older**

**glucose-lowering medications not tested in dedicated**
**cardiovascular outcomes trials**

*5.3.3.1. Metformin*

Despite its long history as the recommended first-line treatment of
hyperglycaemia for patients with T2DM, there have been no dedicated
randomized trials to rigorously assess the CV safety or efficacy of met-­
formin. Randomized trials that have reported CV outcomes with met-­
formin are most-commonly limited by small sample sizes and few CV
events for analysis, yielding low statistical power and substantially un-­
certain statistical precision of the estimates.

The largest randomized trial with the most encouraging CV results
for metformin was a nested randomized trial of 753 patients in the
UKPDS who were overweight or obese at trial entry, comparing con-­
ventional glucose targets with a policy of intensive glucose lowering
with metformin. [183] In overweight and obese patients with newly diag-­
nosed T2DM without previous CVD, metformin reduced MI by 39%,
coronary death by 50%, and stroke by 41% over a median period of
10.7 years. However, with only 39 MIs and 16 coronary deaths in the
metformin arm of the UKPDS, the precision of these efficacy estimates
is largely uncertain. Initial randomization to metformin in the UKPDS
was also associated with a lower incidence of MI and longer survival
during an additional 8–10 years of passive follow-up. [132]

In meta-analyses of 13 randomized clinical trials evaluating the CV ef-­
fects of metformin vs. placebo or active control, including the data from
the UKPDS, none of the differences in assessed CV outcomes was stat-­
istically significant. [184] The pooled HRs (95% CIs) were: all-cause mortal-­
ity 0.96 (0.84–1.09); CV death 0.97 (0.80–1.16); MI 0.89 (0.75–1.06);
stroke 1.04 (0.73–1.48); and peripheral vascular disease 0.81 (0.50–
1.31). While failing to demonstrate CV efficacy, the upper confidence
limits of each of the outcomes analysed provide reassurance on the
CV safety of metformin.

Given the inconclusive results regarding the CV effects of metformin
outlined above, metformin should not be a prerequisite for considering
SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA treatment for CV benefits. However, most
patients in CVOTs with SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs were treated


with metformin. Therefore, in patients already prescribed metformin,
SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs should be added, independent of
the need for additional glucose control. In patients with T2DM and
ASCVD not treated with metformin, an SGLT2 inhibitor and/or GLP-1
RA should be given first line, and metformin should be considered for
those who thereafter warrant additional glucose control. This Class IIa
recommendation for metformin is based on the weight of opinion rather
than the weight of evidence; results from meta-analyses of observational
studies suggest associations with better CV outcome, but this is not sup-­
ported by results from meta-analyses restricted to randomized trials in
patients with T2DM and ASCVD, where no statistically significant effect
of metformin has been observed for any major CV outcome. [184][,][185]

In patients without ASCVD or severe TOD at low or moderate CV
risk, treatment with metformin should be considered based on the
metformin data from the randomized sub-group with overweight or
obesity from the UKPDS. [183] For patients without ASCVD or severe
TOD at high or very CV high risk, treatment with metformin may be
considered based on expert consensus of the Task Force.

*5.3.3.2. Sulphonylureas*
Excepting glimepiride, which was assessed for CV safety and efficacy
head-to-head against linagliptin in the CAROLINA trial, and gliclazidemodified release, which was compared with usual care (that could
have included treatment with a sulphonylurea other than gliclazide) in
the ADVANCE trial, dedicated CV safety assessments have not been
conducted for the other sulphonylureas. [132][,][173][,][174][,][184] In the UKPDS,
which enrolled patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, the sulphonylur-­
eas chlorpropamide and glibenclamide (also known as glyburide) did
not have statistically significant effects on CV outcomes, but important-­
ly, no concerning signal of CV risk was observed. [127] Likewise, in the
ADVANCE trial evaluating more intensive glucose control vs. usual tar-­
gets, patients randomized to the more intensive arm were randomized
to treatment with gliclazide-modified release. [128] While the gliclazidebased more intensive control strategy did not significantly improve
CV outcomes, there were no major CV safety concerns observed.
The relative CV safety of gliclazide and glimepiride is somewhat sup-­
ported by results of contemporary real-world data analyses. [186]

**5.3.4. Special considerations**
*5.3.4.1. Hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular risk*

Results from numerous studies have demonstrated associations between

hypoglycaemia and CV events, with substantial uncertainty about whether
these relationships are causal or simply associations. Results from rando-­
mized trials challenge a causal relationship between hypoglycaemia and ad-­
verse CV outcomes. For example, insulin degludec compared with
glargine in the DEVOTE trial reduced the risk of hypoglycaemia, yet this
did not translate into any difference in CV risk. [181] Likewise, in the
CAROLINA randomized trial, while glimepiride was associated with sig-­
nificantly more hypoglycaemia than the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin,
MACE did not differ between the two randomized groups. [180] The results
of these two trials challenge, to some degree, the premise that avoiding
hypoglycaemia may improve CV risk. In analyses of data from the
TECOS randomized trial, which compared sitagliptin with placebo, hypo-­
glycaemia events were independently associated with subsequent CV
events, but importantly, the converse was also true. [139] A non-fatal CV
event was independently associated with subsequent hypoglycaemia.
Similar results were confirmed in other trials. [140][,][187][,][188]

**4070** ESC Guidelines


Therefore, the data suggest that the relationship between hypogly-­
caemia events and risk of CV events (and vice versa) is most likely
one of association rather than causation, each risk marking vulnerability
and frailty of high CV risk patients. Still, in certain patients, hypogly-­
caemia may directly contribute to CV risk. In addition, avoiding hypogly-­
caemia remains important given the unpleasant patient experience and,
for severe events, life-threatening nature if third-party assistance is not

available.

*5.3.4.2. Effects on weight*
The choice of glucose-lowering therapy is often influenced by effects on
weight, when weight loss or avoiding weight gain is a priority. The insu-­
lins, sulphonylureas, and pioglitazone all cause weight gain; metformin,
acarbose, and the DPP-4 inhibitors are weight neutral or may result
in small amounts of weight loss; and the SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1
RAs are associated with clinically meaningful weight loss, with weight
effects of GLP-1 RAs being more pronounced than that of SGLT2

inhibitors.


**5.3.5. Implications of results from cardiovascular**
**outcomes trials of glucose-lowering medications**

Beginning with the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial results in 2015, an everincreasing body of evidence has accumulated from many CVOTs of
glucose-lowering medications for patients with T2DM that indicate CV
benefits from using selected SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs in patients
with ASCVD. The combined results obtained from CVOTs using GLP-1
RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors support the primacy of their recommendation
for all patients with T2DM with prevalent ASCVD, with such considera-­
tions made independently of decisions about glycaemic management
( *Figures 7 and 8* ). Just as T2DM informs prescription of statins, antithrom-­
botic therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is)/
angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), and other CV risk-mitigating
therapies independent of glycaemic considerations, the same should
now apply to prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs.

The mechanisms of CV benefits of the novel glucose-lowering
medications with proven efficacy remain incompletely understood.
For the GLP-1 RAs, CV efficacy is driven by reduced risk of

ASCVD-related events. [164] While empagliflozin and canagliflozin im-­
proved the composite of CV death, MI, and stroke, all of the
SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HF-related endpoints ( *Section 7* ) and pro-­
gression of kidney disease ( *Section 9* ). [155][,][190] Thus, SGLT2 inhibitors
are recommended to reduce HF hospitalization in patients with
T2DM with or at risk of HF, or who have CKD. In patients with newly
diagnosed T2DM without CVD or other major CV risk factors who
are at low or moderate CV risk, factors other than mitigating CV and
kidney risk may play a greater role in selecting glucose-lowering med-­
ications, such as affordability, accessibility, side effects, weight bene-­
fits, tolerability, and ease of use.

**5.4. Blood pressure and diabetes**
In the most recent ESC/EURObservational Research Programme
(EORP) EUROASPIRE surveys, history of hypertension was present

in 80% of men and 87% of women with known diabetes and in 74%

of men and 81% of women with newly diagnosed diabetes with a his-­
tory of coronary heart disease (CHD). [191]

**5.4.1. Screening and diagnosis**
Regular BP measurements under standardized conditions are manda-­
tory in all patients with diabetes ( *Figure 9;* *Table 8* ). Hypertension
should be confirmed in both arms using multiple readings, including
measurements on separate days. [48][,][157] In patients with CVD and values
>180/110 mmHg, it could be reasonable to diagnose hypertension at a
single visit. [192] Details on BP measurements are comprehensively sum-­
marized in the 2018 ESC/European Society of Hypertension (ESH)
Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension and in the
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Section 2.6.1* . [193]

**5.4.2. Treatment targets**
Randomized controlled trials have shown the benefit (reduction of
stroke, coronary events, and kidney disease) of lowering SBP to

<140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to <90 mmHg in pa-­
tients with diabetes. However, the optimal BP target in patients with
diabetes is still a matter of debate. The UKPDS post-trial, 10-year
follow-up study reported no benefits persisting from the earlier period
of tight BP control with respect to macrovascular events, death, and
microvascular complications, while initial between-group BP differ-­
ences were no longer maintained. [132] RCTs evaluating the benefits
and risks of more intense compared with standard hypertension treat-­
ment strategies in patients with diabetes are summarized in
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S10* .

In a meta-analysis of RCTs involving patients with diabetes or prediabetes, an SBP reduction to ≤135 mmHg compared with a less intensive
control reduced the RR of all-cause mortality by 10% (odds ratio [OR] 0.90;


95% CI, 0.83–0.98), whereas more intensive BP control (≤130 mmHg) was
associated with a greater reduction in stroke but did not reduce other
events. [194][,][195] Similarly, anti-hypertensive treatment significantly reduced
mortality in people with T2DM, CAD, HF, and stroke, with an achieved
mean SBP of 138 mmHg, whereas only stroke was reduced significantly,
with a mean SBP of 122 mmHg compared with higher BP values. [196]

Thus, reducing SBP to <130 mmHg may benefit patients with a particularly
high risk of a cerebrovascular event, such as those with a history of
stroke. [193][,][194][,][196][–][200] However, SBP >140 mmHg or <120 mmHg were re-­
lated to higher risk of adverse renal outcomes in patients with diabetes
when compared with those without diabetes and with high CV risk. [199][–][202]

The 2018 ESC/ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hyper-­
tension recommend that in all patients with diabetes, office BP should
be targeted to an SBP of 130 mmHg, and lower if tolerated but not
<120 mmHg; DBP should be lowered to <80 mmHg but not
<70 mmHg. [193] In older patients (age ≥65 years), the SBP target range
should be 130–140 mmHg if tolerated. [193] However, more recent data
challenge these recommendations for all patients with diabetes, and
highlight a potential need for more individualized target levels. [157][,][203][,][204]

The 2021 ESC Prevention Guideline recommends office SBP treat-­
ment target ranges of 120–130 mmHg in patients with diabetes, with
lower SBP acceptable if tolerated until the age of 69 years. [48] In patients
aged ≥70 years, SBP values <140 mmHg, down to 130 mmHg if toler-­
ated are recommended. DBP treatment target <80 mmHg is recom-­
mended for all treated patients.

**5.4.3. Management of hypertension**
*5.4.3.1. Effects of lifestyle intervention and weight loss*

Diets rich in vegetables, fruits, and low-fat dairy products, such as the
Mediterranean diets and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-style
eating patterns (including reducing sodium to <100 mmol/day and increas-­
ing potassium intake), improve BP control. [205][–][207]

**4074** ESC Guidelines


Long-term exercise training intervention modestly but significantly

− −
reduces SBP (by 7 mmHg) and DBP (by 5 mmHg). Ideally, an exer-­
cise prescription aimed at lowering BP in individuals with normal BP
or hypertension would include a mix of predominantly aerobic exercise
training supplemented with dynamic resistance exercise training. [208]

A marked improvement in CV risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidae-­
mia, diabetes), associated with marked weight loss, was observed after
bariatric surgery. [209] In the Look AHEAD trial, those who lost 5 to
<10% of body weight had increased odds of achieving a 5 mmHg de-­
crease in SBP and DBP compared with those who lost >10% or
<5%. [210] The frequency of CV complications appears to be modulated
by ethnicity or racial identity. [193][,][211][,][212]

*5.4.3.2. Pharmacological treatments in patients with diabetes*
If office SBP is ≥140 mmHg and/or DBP is ≥90 mmHg, drug therapy is
necessary in combination with non-pharmacological treatment. It is re-­
commended to start with a combination therapy. [48] All available
BP-lowering drugs can be used, but evidence strongly supports using a
renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor (ACE-I, ARB), particularly in
patients with evidence of end-organ damage (albuminuria and left ven-­
tricular [LV] hypertrophy). [213][–][216] However, in a recent meta-analysis,
RAS inhibitors were not superior to other classes of anti-hypertensive
drugs for reducing total or CV mortality and renal events. [217]

Controlling BP often requires multiple drug therapy with an RAS inhibi-­
tor and a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or diuretic, while the combination
of an ACE-I with an ARB is not recommended. [218] Consider beta-blockers

at any treatment step when specifically indicated, e.g. HF, angina, post-MI,
AF, or younger women with or planning pregnancy. [193] A combination of
two or more drugs at fixed doses in a single pill should be considered to
improve adherence and to achieve earlier control of BP. [48][,][219]

In apparent resistant (including MRA-resistant) hypertension in pa-­
tients with HFpEF (61% diabetes; *post-hoc* analysis of PARAGON-HF

[Efficacy and Safety of LCZ696 Compared to Valsartan, on Morbidity
and Mortality in Heart Failure Patients With Preserved Ejection
Fraction] trial) sacubitril/valsartan helped to better control BP com-­
pared with valsartan. [220]

*5.4.3.3. Blood pressure changes with glucose-lowering agents*

Trials testing GLP-1 RAs have shown a BP decrease with these drugs,
partly due to weight loss. A sustained decrease in BP was observed
with semaglutide therapy (SBP dose dependent: −1.3 to −2.6 mmHg)
with a slight increase in heart rate (+2 to 2.5 beats per minute

[b.p.m.]). [72] Similar effects were seen in other studies of GLP-1 RAs
and derived from meta-analysis. [161][,][221][,][222]

SGLT2 inhibitors induced a larger BP decrease than did GLP-1 RAs
without changing heart rate. [223][–][225] A recent meta-analysis including seven
RCTs demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with an aver-­
age reduction of 3.6/1.7 mmHg (systolic/diastolic) in 24 h ambulatory BP,
which is comparable with efficacy of low-dose hydrochlorothiazide. [224][–][226]

**5.4.4. Sex-specific aspects**
In general, the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension is comparable
between sexes, except for women of child-bearing potential or during
pregnancy, when some drugs, such as RAS blockers, can have adverse
effects on the foetus, especially in early gestation. [227] The possible effect
of oral contraceptives on BP should also be considered. [48] There is
some evidence from RCTs that BP targets during pregnancy should
range from 110 to 135 mmHg for SBP and 80 to 85 mmHg for
DBP. [228] This is also supported by the recent CHAP (Chronic
Hypertension and Pregnancy) study of mild chronic hypertension in


pregnancy, where 16% of the pregnant women had diabetes. [229] The
strategy targeting a BP of <140/90 mmHg was related with better preg-­
ancy outcomes without an increase in the number of Small for
Gestational Age babies.

Women usually show greater differences in BP and higher propor-­
tions of hypertension than men already at diagnosis of T2DM com-­
pared with women and men without T2DM, and worse BP control
thereafter. [191][,][230] Moreover sex-specific, hypertension-mediated organ
damage was evidenced with a very high risk of HFpEF in women, espe-­
cially in the presence of diabetes. [231]

ESC Guidelines **4075**


**5.5. Lipids and diabetes**
A cluster of lipid and apolipoprotein abnormalities accompanies dia-­
betes. The core components are moderately elevated plasma triglycer-­
ide (TG), TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL), and TRL cholesterol levels,
normal-to-mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
(LDL-C), and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C).
Other features comprise structure and function of lipoproteins, e.g.
small dense LDL and HDL particles. The same abnormalities are also
reported in patients with T1DM, whose long-lasting exposure to dysli-­
pidaemia might induce atherosclerosis as early as in adolescence. In
T1DM, high LDL-C values are seen in patients with uncontrolled gly-­
caemia, while high levels of HDL-C might be pro-inflammatory and
therefore atherogenic instead of protective. [244] In well-controlled
T1DM, HDL-C levels tend to be normal (or even slightly elevated),
as are serum TGs. [245]

**5.5.1. Treatment targets**

Epidemiological studies have shown that high levels of LDL-C and

non-HDL-C and low levels of HDL-C are associated with an increased
risk of CV events and mortality in patients with and without diabetes. [246]

Conversely, RCTs with lipid-lowering agents in patients at risk of CV
events (including patients with T2DM) have demonstrated a log-linear
proportional reduction of CV events and mortality for each 1 mmol re-­
duction of LDL-C. [247] LDL-C is the primary target of lipid-lowering
therapies. A secondary goal of non-HDL-C should also be considered
in patients with diabetes and combined dyslipidaemias, although there
are limited data from interventional trials. Treatment targets differ
among patients with diabetes based on their CV risk (Section *4* ;
*Figure 10* ). [48] Due to the lack of evidence, no clear recommendations
can be given for patients with T2DM at low CV risk.


**5.5.2. Lipid-lowering agents**
*5.5.2.1. Statins*

Statins remain the first-line therapy to reduce LDL-C levels in patients
with diabetes and dyslipidaemia, due to their efficacy in preventing CV
events and reducing CV mortality with no evidence for sex
differences. [248][,][249]

High-intensity statins (rosuvastatin and atorvastatin) are indicated in
patients with diabetes at high or very high CV risk, as they lower LDL-C
by 40–63% and significantly reduce the incidence of major cerebral and
coronary complications. [250] This beneficial effect outweighs the poten-­
tial diabetogenic effect of these drugs, estimated as a 9% increased risk
of incident diabetes, especially in older patients and in patients already
at risk of developing diabetes. [251][,][252] Similar benefits were seen in both
T1DM and T2DM. [253][–][255]

Statins are safe and generally well tolerated. Subjective adverse events
(such as fatigue, myalgias, and nervous system symptoms) are more fre-­
quent than objective adverse events due to the nocebo effect, with wo-­
men experiencing adverse events more frequently than men. [256] In most
cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, there are drug interactions with a
higher-than-standard dose of statin or combination with gemfibrozil. [200]

Evidence indicates that 70–90% of patients who report statin intolerance
are able to take a statin when re-challenged. [257]

*5.5.2.2. Ezetimibe*

Lowering of LDL-C can be further intensified by adding ezetimibe to a
statin, which reduces cholesterol absorption from the ileum. [258] The
IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy
International Trial) trial showed significantly reduced MACE (compos-­
ite of CV death, non-fatal MI, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization ≥30 days after

randomization, or non-fatal stroke; HR 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–0.99) in pa-­
tients post-ACS receiving simvastatin plus ezetimibe, with a stronger
benefit in the sub-group of patients with diabetes (HR 0.85; 95% CI,
0.78–0.94; *P* <0.001). [259][,][260] The combination of ezetimibe with a statin
is therefore recommended in patients with diabetes and a recent ACS,
especially when an LDL-C target <1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) is required
and not achieved with a statin alone. Young adults with T1DM have in-­
creased cholesterol absorption, as shown in a recent study, suggesting
greater efficacy of ezetimibe in this population, which remains to be as-­
sessed with dedicated RCTs. [261]

*5.5.2.3. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors*

The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors
evolocumab and alirocumab are monoclonal antibodies that strongly
reduce plasma LDL-C, targeting the protein involved in regulating the
LDL receptor on the hepatocyte. [262] Administered alongside highintensity statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe), PCSK9 inhibitors
significantly reduced MACE in the sub-groups of patients with diabetes
with ASCVD enrolled in the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular
Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated
Risk) trial and in the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of
Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome
During Treatment With Alirocumab) trial, respectively. [263][,][264] In par-­
ticular, evolocumab showed a 17% RR reduction of a composite pri-­
mary endpoint of CV death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for unstable
angina, or coronary revascularization in patients with diabetes included
in the FOURIER trial (HR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75–0.93; *P* = 0.0008). [263]

Compared with placebo, evolocumab also significantly reduced other
atherogenic lipids (i.e. TGs, non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B-containing
particles) in patients with diabetes and mixed dyslipidaemia enrolled
in the BANTING (Evaluation of Evolocumab Efficacy in Diabetic
Adults With Hypercholesterolemia/Mixed Dyslipidemia) and
BERSON (Safety and Efficacy of Evolocumab in Combination With
Statin Therapy in Adults With Diabetes and Hyperlipidemia or Mixed
Dyslipidemia) studies. [265][,][266]

Alirocumab significantly reduced the rate of a composite of CV
death, MI, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina in the sub-group
of patients with ACS with T2DM ( *n* = 5444) of the ODYSSEY
OUTCOMES trial. [267] Alirocumab on top of the maximum tolerated
statin dose was also more effective than ezetimibe, fenofibrate, or
non-lipid-lowering therapy in reducing non-HDL-C and other athero-­
genic lipids in patients with diabetes enrolled in the ODYSSEY
DM-DYSLIPIDEMIA (Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab Versus Usual
Care on Top of Maximally Tolerated Statin Therapy in Patients With
Type 2 Diabetes and Mixed Dyslipidemia) trial. [268]

A meta-analysis by Khan *et al* . did not show a significant association be-­
tween PCSK9 inhibitors and new-onset diabetes (HR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93–
1.07; *P* = 0.96; *I* [2 ] = 0%), while confirming a modest risk of incident diabetes
with statins only (HR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05–1.15; *P* < 0.001; *I* [2 ] = 0%). [269]

*5.5.2.4. Fibrates and other TG-lowering drugs*
Potential use of fibrates to reduce TG levels is quite limited, due to the
risk of myopathy if given with statins and the little benefit demonstrated
in RCTs, aside from sub-group analysis including subjects with very high
TG levels. [200][,][270][,][271] Pemafibrate is a new selective peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-α modulator with a superior
benefit-risk balance compared with conventional fibrates. [272] A phase
3 trial determining the efficacy of pemafibrate in preventing MACE in
patients with diabetes has been terminated early for futility. [273]


If TGs remain elevated even with a statin-based regimen, icosapent
ethyl, a stable ester of eicosapentaenoic acid, might be preferred
over other omega–3 fatty acids at the dose of 2 g twice a day (b.i.d.),
due to its favourable impact on CV outcomes reported in the
REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent
Ethyl—Intervention Trial) trial, where benefit was consistent in patients
with (58%) and without diabetes ( *P* int = 0.29). [274] This benefit remained
significant even considering a slight increase of LDL-C and highsensitivity C-reactive protein due to the effect of mineral oil in the pla-­
cebo arm. [275][,][276]

**5.5.3. Novel cholesterol-lowering drugs**
*5.5.3.1. Inclisiran*
Inclisiran inhibits hepatic synthesis of PCSK9 with a long-lasting effect. [277]

Patients on statins with high LDL-C levels and ASCVD or at least one
ASCVD risk equivalent were included in the two phase 3 trials
ORION-10 and ORION-11 (Inclisiran for Participants With
Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease and Elevated Low-density
Lipoprotein Cholesterol), and obtained a further 50% reduction of
LDL-C with inclisiran. [278] This benefit was consistent in patients with dia-­
betes in both trials, and CV outcome endpoints are currently being tested
in a phase 3 trial enrolling patients with ASCVD (ORION-4 trial). [279]

*5.5.3.2. Bempedoic acid*
Bempedoic acid is a pro-drug that reduces cholesterol synthesis by in-­
hibiting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase, with very limited
musculoskeletal-related side effects. [280] In the CLEAR (Cholesterol
Lowering via Bempedoic Acid, an ACL-Inhibiting Regimen) Harmony
trial, adding bempedoic acid to statins significantly reduced LDL-C le-­
vels (–16.5%) in patients with ASCVD or familial hypercholesterol-­
aemia, with consistent results in the sub-group of patients with
diabetes (–19.1%). [267] Bempedoic acid did not induce new-onset dia-­
betes or worsen diabetes as shown by a subsequent meta-analysis. [281]

High CV risk patients who were unable or unwilling to take statins
have been included in the CLEAR Outcomes study and randomized
to bempedoic acid or placebo. Among the 6992 patients assigned to
the active arm of the study 45% had T2DM. Bempedoic acid was asso-­
ciated with a significantly lower incidence of the four-component com-­
posite primary endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or
coronary revascularization and a higher incidence of some adverse
events (gout and cholelithiasis) at the 40.6 month follow-up. Of note,
the data were only released just before finalising these Guidelines and
could thus not be included. [282]

**5.6. Antithrombotic therapy and diabetes**
Several mechanisms contribute to platelet activation and coagulation in
diabetes ( *Figure 11* ). The pharmacology of different antithrombotic
[agents can be found in the Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Section 2.7* and

**5.6.1. Patients without a history of symptomatic**
**atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or**

**revascularization**

The largest meta-analysis on 95 000 individual participant data (IPD) of
patients at average CV risk (0.57% MACE/year) from six RCTs, included
3818 (4%) patients with diabetes. In the whole cohort, low-dose acetyl-­
salicylic acid (ASA) significantly reduced MACE vs. control (absolute risk
reduction [ARR] 0.06%/year; *P* = 0.0001), while increasing major extra-­
cranial bleed (0.10% vs. 0.07%/year; absolute risk increase 0.03%/year;
*P* < 0.0001; [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S11* ). [291] A similar


proportional benefit-risk profile was also observed in the diabetes sub[group (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S11* ).

The ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events iN Diabetes) trial
was the largest, adequately powered, placebo-controlled RCT testing
low-dose ASA in patients with T1DM or T2DM ( *n* = 15 480) with no
evident CVD. [292] Over 7.4 years, ASA significantly reduced serious vas-­
cular events vs. placebo (8.5% vs. 9.6%, respectively; RR 0.88; 95% CI,
0.79–0.90; *P* = 0.01; number needed to treat [NNT] 91;
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S11* ), with a relative benefit similar
to the previous meta-analysis. [291] Bleeding Academic Research
[Consortium (BARC) type 3–5 bleeding (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)
*[Figure S6](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)* ) occurred in 4.1% vs. 3.2% of patients in the ASA and placebo
arms, respectively (RR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.09–1.52; *P* = 0.003; number
needed to harm [NNH] 111). ASA-associated major bleeding excess
was largely gastrointestinal, without differences in fatal, intracranial,
and ocular bleeding. The NNT/NNH ratio was 0.8. The pre-specified
sub-group analysis based on vascular risk score at baseline was consist-­
[ent with the overall population (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Figure S7* ).

The benefit of ASA in the ASCEND trial was observed on top of sta-­
tins (75% of patients) and/or anti-hypertensive (∼60% of patients)
drugs. [292] Consistently, a recent IPD meta-analysis of 18 162 patients
with multiple CV risk factors and no previous ASCVD (risk 1.7%/
year) showed a significant benefit of low-dose ASA, incremental to
lipid- and BP-lowering drugs. This was also observed in a diabetes sub[group (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S11* ). [293]

A 9.2-year follow-up analysis of the ASCEND trial excluded harm of
ASA on incident dementia, with a trend towards a reduction (HR 0.89;
95% CI, 0.75–1.06) confirmed by a meta-analysis of three large primary
prevention RCTs (HR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84–1.01; *P* = 0.09). [294]

Large, observational, prospective data suggest CAC as a non-invasive
biomarker to identify asymptomatic patients at the highest risk of
ASCVD or revascularization, with or without diabetes, who may largely
benefit from ASA. [295] Ongoing trials are testing the relevance of CAC
score and related thresholds in improving primary prevention, including
in asymptomatic patients with diabetes. [296][–][298]

In summary, in patients with diabetes and no history of symptomatic
ASCVD or revascularization, ASA (75–100 mg o.d.) may be considered
to prevent the first severe vascular event. However, in patients with
diabetes with asymptomatic ASCVD (including documented CAD con-­
firmed by imaging) and a higher CV risk, the net benefit of platelet in-­
hibition by ASA may be higher and thus, therapy needs to be

individualized.

with diabetes. An inflammatory environment, metabolic changes, endothelial dysfunction and altered platelet turnover result in a platelet population char-­
acterized by enhanced activation, increased thrombin generation, and suppression of the fibrinolytic system. Thrombin release by platelets and *de novo* gen-­
eration through activation of the coagulation pathway further amplify platelet activation and result in fibrin network formation, thus playing a pivotal role in
the increased risk of thrombosis in individuals with diabetes.


**5.6.2. Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular**

**disease and/or revascularization without an**

**indication for long-term oral anticoagulation**
*5.6.2.1. Chronic coronary syndromes*
Patients with diabetes and documented significant CAD or with prior
revascularization are at very high CV risk, and low-dose ASA (75–
100 mg o.d.) is recommended, although *ad hoc* RCTs are lacking. [48][,][299]

Both the ADAPTABLE (Aspirin Dosing: A Patient-Centric Trial
Assessing Benefits and Long-term) and CURRENT-OASIS 7
(Clopidogrel Optimal Loading Dose Usage to Reduce Recurrent
EveNTs/Optimal Antiplatelet Strategy for InterventionS) trials showed
comparable efficacy of a lower dose (75–100 mg o.d.) and a three- to


four-fold higher (300–325 mg o.d.) ASA dose in both chronic coronary
syndrome (CCS) and ACS. [300][,][301]

Clopidogrel provides an alternative in ASA-intolerant patients or can
be combined with low-dose ASA (clopidogrel 75 mg o.d. and ASA 75–
100 mg o.d.) as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with CCS
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

The THEMIS (Effect of Ticagrelor on Health Outcomes in Diabetes
Mellitus Patients Intervention Study) trial tested the efficacy and safety of
adding the P2Y 12 inhibitor ticagrelor (60 mg b.i.d.) or placebo to ASA
(75–150 mg o.d.) in 19 220 patients with diabetes and a history of PCI or
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or a documented stenosis (≥50%)
in at least one coronary artery, and no previous MI or stroke

ESC Guidelines **4079**


[(Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S11* ). [302] Over a median 3.3 years of
follow-up, the primary efficacy outcome of CV death, MI, or stroke showed
a marginal 10% RR reduction by ticagrelor vs. placebo, while both
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major and intracranial bleed-­
ing were significantly increased. The pre-specified sub-groups of CABG or
previous PCI showed a benefit-risk profile consistent with the entire
trial. [302][,][303] The NNT/NNH ratio was 1.5. Thus, an unfavourable
benefit-risk profile is associated with adding ticagrelor to ASA in this setting.

The COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using
Anticoagulation Strategies) trial enrolled 27 395 patients with stable
ASCVD (previous MI, symptomatic CAD, and/or PAD). Low-dose
ASA combined with very low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg b.i.d.) was su-­
perior to ASA and placebo in preventing MACE (4.1% vs. 5.4%, respect-­
ively; HR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66–0.86; *P* < 0.001; NNT 77). [304] International
Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis-defined major bleeding, but
not fatal or intracranial bleeding, was increased (1.9% vs. 3.1%, respect-­
ively; HR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.40–2.05; *P* < 0.001; NNH 83), with an NNT/
[NNH ratio of 0.9 (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Figure S7* ). The propor-­
tional benefit-risk profile of the diabetes sub-group (38% of all patients)
was similar to the overall population. Based on these data, adding very
low-dose rivaroxaban to low-dose ASA for long-term prevention of
serious vascular events should be considered in patients with diabetes
and CCS or symptomatic PAD without high bleeding risk. [304][,][305] Data
are available up to 47 months of ASA plus very low-dose rivaroxaban
exposure; beyond this time, continuation should be determined on
an individual basis and with regular evaluation of thrombotic vs. bleeding

risks.

*5.6.2.2. Acute coronary syndrome*
*5.6.2.2.1. Peri-procedural management.* Peri-procedural management
of patients with ACS or undergoing PCI, which may include glycoprotein
IIb/IIIa inhibitors, cangrelor, heparins, or bivalirudin, is detailed in the 2018
ESC/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS)
Guidelines on myocardial revascularization. [299][,][306][–][308]

*5.6.2.2.2. Post-procedural management.* In patients with ACS
undergoing PCI, 12 months’ DAPT with low-dose ASA and prasugrel
or ticagrelor was superior to DAPT with clopidogrel in the diabetes
sub-group of the respective RCTs, with a benefit-risk profile similar
[to the overall trial populations (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Tables*
*[S12–13](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)* ). [309][–][312] With the limitations of a subgroup analysis, patients
with diabetes on DAPT with low-dose ASA and prasugrel tended to
have a more favourable benefit-risk profile. [312] The open-label
ISAR-REACT 5 (Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen:
Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment) trial randomized 4018 pa-­
tients with ACS to prasugrel or ticagrelor added to ASA. [313] Prasugrel
was superior to ticagrelor in reducing MACE without increasing major
bleeding, with similar effects in the sub-group of patients with diabetes
( *n* [= 892; 22%; Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S12* ). [313]

Thus, DAPT, i.e. low-dose ASA with prasugrel or ticagrelor are pre-­
ferred to DAPT with clopidogrel in patients with diabetes and ACS
[(Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S12* ), [309][–][312] unless the patient is
deemed at very high bleeding risk. Of note, patients with T2DM
have a reduced generation of the active metabolite of clopidogrel
[compared with patients without diabetes (Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)
online, *[Section 2.7](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)* ). [323][,][324] Notably, previous intracranial bleeding con-­
traindicates patients to both prasugrel and ticagrelor.

In patients with diabetes and ACS who do not undergo cardiac revas-­
cularization, DAPT with ASA (75–100 mg o.d.) and a P2Y 12 receptor


inhibitor, preferably ticagrelor over clopidogrel, is recommended for
12 months. [314][,][315]

*5.6.2.2.3. Prolonging DAPT post-ACS.* The GLOBAL-LEADERS
(A Clinical Study Comparing Two Forms of Antiplatelet Therapy
After Stent Implantation) trial failed to show superior efficacy or safety
of 24 months of ticagrelor monotherapy post-ACS vs. the standard
12-month DAPT followed by 12-month low-dose ASA monotherapy
in the overall and diabetes (25% of all patients) cohorts. [316]

The PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in
Patients With Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to
Placebo on a Background of Aspirin) trial compared prolonged ticagre-­
lor therapy (60 or 90 mg b.i.d.) with placebo added to low-dose ASA in
patients with an MI 1–3 years before study entry and additional CV risk
factors. [317] Reduced-dose ticagrelor (60 mg) decreased MACE com-­
pared with placebo (7.77% vs. 9.04%, respectively; HR 0.84; 95% CI,
0.74–0.95; *P* = 0.004; NNT 79), with no heterogeneity with respect
to the diabetes sub-group, whereas it significantly increased TIMI major
bleeding (2.3% vs. 1.06%, respectively; HR 2.32; 95% CI, 1.68–3.21;
NNH 81), dyspnoea, serious adverse events, and drug discontinuation
rates. [317] Based on these data, DAPT prolonged beyond 12 months
should be considered up to 3 years in patients with diabetes who
have tolerated DAPT without major bleeding. [63][,][317][,][318] The median
follow-up across all trials on prolonging full-dose DAPT was 18 months
(interquartile range 12–24 months), with a maximum DAPT exposure
no longer than 36 months. [318] No sufficient safety and efficacy data are
available for DAPT with reduced-dose ticagrelor beyond 3 years, espe-­
cially considering the significant TIMI major bleeding increase of the as-­
[sociation (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Figure S6* ). [317][,][319]

*5.6.2.2.4. Shortening or de-escalating DAPT post-ACS in diabetes.*
No evidence supports shortening or de-escalating DAPT post-ACS specif-­
ically in patients with diabetes, since RCTs on shorter DAPT duration fol-­
lowed by ASA or a P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy are relatively small, often
with non-inferiority design for efficacy, relatively low power, and wide noninferiority margins. In addition, these RCTs had primary endpoints combin-­
ing minor bleeding with traditional efficacy outcomes, efficacy outcomes
including not only MACE, and diabetes sub-groups that contain few pa-­
tients and events, especially on the major hard endpoints
[(Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S13* ). [320][,][321] Moreover, large, superiority
RCTs have failed to show a higher efficacy of routine platelet-function test-­
ing in guiding antiplatelet therapy post-PCI. [322][,][322a] Of note, the
TROPICAL-ACS (Testing Responsiveness to Platelet Inhibition on
Chronic Antiplatelet Treatment For Acute Coronary Syndromes) trial ‘deescalating’ P2Y 12 inhibition from prasugrel to clopidogrel after 2 weeks of
DAPT based on platelet function testing showed an upper HR limit for
MACE of 1.93 in the diabetes sub-group (HR 1.17; 95% CI, 0.71–1.93).
Moreover, CV death was significantly increased in sub-groups with dia-­
betes vs. without diabetes in the ‘de-escalating’ arm (HR 2.42; 95% CI,
0.61–9.67; *P* int = 0.04), thus suggesting harm from de-escalation compared
with standard recommended DAPT. [321] In addition, patients with diabetes
form less of the clopidogrel active metabolite resulting in less platelet inhib-­
[ition (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Section 2.7* ). [323][,][324]

Thus, shortening or de-escalating DAPT below 12 months is not recom-­
mended in patients with diabetes in the 12 months post-ACS. Current evi-­
dence does not support platelet function testing to adjust DAPT.

**5.6.3. Patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular**

**disease and/or revascularization requiring long-term**
**oral anticoagulation**

In patients requiring long-term oral anticoagulants (OACs; e.g. those
with AF) undergoing PCI for ACS or CCS, DAPT with clopidogrel is
combined with full-dose OACs (triple antithrombotic therapy

[TAT]). Combined antithrombotic drugs, while effective, increase
major bleeding risk. [337][,][338] RCTs have compared TAT with dual an-­
tithrombotic therapy (DAT) combining an OAC mostly with clopi-­
[dogrel, in patients with AF and ACS or post-PCI (Supplementary](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)
[data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S14* ). These RCTs have some common features:
a primary outcome of safety comprising moderate-to-major, often
[BARC-defined, bleeding (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Figure S7* ); effi-­
cacy (including CV death, MI, stroke, as well as revascularization, and/
or stent thrombosis) as a secondary endpoint, often with a noninferiority comparison; relatively short follow-up (6–14 months);
and limited sample size with few patients with diabetes (28–37%
across RCTs; [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S14* ). [339][–][342] Thus,
these RCTs are underpowered to assess both the efficacy of DAT
and the safety of major bleeding of TAT in patients with diabetes.
Moreover, two meta-analyses suggest significantly higher MI and
[stent thrombosis rates with DAT vs. TAT (Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)
online, *[Table S14](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)* ). [343][,][344] The lack of high-quality evidence on efficacy,
meta-analyses suggesting some harm, and the underlying high CV and
stent thrombosis risk in patients with diabetes, indicate that TAT
duration should be cautiously and systematically evaluated for
both thrombotic and bleeding risks in the individual patient with

diabetes.

**5.6.4. Preventing gastrointestinal bleeding**

Large observational studies or head-to-head RCTs show similar rates
of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal major bleeding for single
antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with low-dose ASA or a P2Y 12 inhibitor
(clopidogrel or ticagrelor). [337][,][338][,][346][–][350] Thus, gastrointestinal mucosal
bleeding appears to be due to pre-existing mucosal lesions associated
with defective primary haemostasis secondary to platelet inhibition,
rather than with a specific antiplatelet drug. A meta-analysis showed
that gastroprotectant drugs significantly reduce the risk of gastro-­
intestinal bleeding in patients on single or combined antithrombotic
drugs. [351] This benefit was also observed in the pre-specified subgroup of 6732 patients with diabetes in the COMPASS trial, consist-­
ent with large population studies on proton pump inhibitors and
OACs (either vitamin K antagonist [VKA] or non-vitamin K antagonist
oral anticoagulant [NOACs]). [352] Regarding CV safety, the composite
of MI, stroke, CV death, CHD, and acute limb ischaemia was similar
between pantoprazole and placebo, as was the rate of new-onset dia-­
betes. [337][,][351][–][355]

**5.7. Multifactorial approach to risk-factor**
**management in diabetes**
Optimal risk factor and lifestyle management, as well as early identification
and treatment of comorbidities, is a cornerstone of treatment for
T2DM. [357][–][359] The Swedish National Diabetes Registry revealed a clear im-­
provement of clinical outcomes by each risk factor within the target range
(HbA1c, LDL-C, albuminuria, smoking, and SBP). [360] In patients with ad-­
vanced disease, e.g. T2DM and established microalbuminuria, an intensive,
target-driven, multifactorial therapy (Steno-2 study; targets: HbA1c <6.5%,
total cholesterol <4.5 mmol/L [175 mg/dL], and BP <130/80 mmHg) re-­
sulted in 50% fewer microvascular and macrovascular events after 7.8
years of follow-up. [361] Long-term follow-up (21 years from baseline)
showed significantly reduced end-stage renal disease combined with death
(HR 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35–0.80), and risk of HF hospitalization reduced by
70%. [362] Overall, this resulted in a 7.9 year gain of life expectancy. [363]

These positive effects were not observed in the clinical intervention trials
of intensified, multifactorial treatment for T2DM in primary care and early
in the disease trajectory. The ADDITION (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of
Intensive Treatment in People with Screen Detected Diabetes in
Primary Care) trial showed that microvascular or macrovascular events
were not significantly reduced after 5 or 10 years (17% and 13% reduction,
respectively), while intervention only slightly improved HbA1c. [364][,][365] In ac-­
cordance, the J-DOIT3 (Japan Diabetes Optimal Integrated Treatment
Study for 3 Major Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Diseases) trial in patients
with T2DM aged 45–69 years revealed a non-significant trend towards a
reduced primary composite outcome (non-fatal MI, stroke, revasculariza-­
tion, or all-cause death; HR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63–1.04; *P* = 0.094) with inten-­
sive vs. conventional therapy. [366] *Post-hoc* analyses showed that only
cerebrovascular events were reduced (HR 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24–0.74; *P* =
0.002), while no differences were seen for all-cause death and coronary
events. In addition, the Look AHEAD trial, introducing lifestyle intervention
in patients with obesity and T2DM with 10 years’ follow-up, did not dem-­
onstrate a reduction in the composite CV outcome. [56]

Key problems in optimally treating patients with T2DM and CVD are
the low rate of detection of T2DM in patients with CVD, the low re-­
ferral rate to diabetes specialists, and the difficulty of prolonged adher-­
ence to medication or lifestyle interventions in this patient group. The
EUROASPIRE V survey reported that many patients with CVD (29.7%)
had known diabetes, while 41.1% of those with unknown T2DM were
dysglycaemic. [367] Of patients with known diabetes, 31% had been ad-­
vised to attend a diabetes clinic, though only 24% attended. Only
58% of dysglycaemic patients were prescribed all cardio-protective
drugs, and use of SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs was limited (3%
and 1%, respectively). [367] A BP target <140/90 mmHg was achieved in
only 61% of patients with newly detected T2DM, and in 54% of patients
with previously known T2DM. [34] An LDL-C target <1.8 mmol/L was
only achieved in 18% and 28% of patients, respectively. This was ex-­
plained by low prescription rates of the combination of all cardioprotective drugs (antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, RAS inhibitors,
and statins) in only 55% of patients with newly detected T2DM, and
in 60% of patients with previously known T2DM. [34] The concept of a
polypill, e.g. containing aspirin, ramipril, and atorvastatin, may even im-­
prove clinical events in secondary cardiovascular prevention. [368]

Furthermore, adherence to lifestyle intervention fades over time, with
continuously increasing body weight after 1 year. [56] To overcome adher-­
ence failures, the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular disease preven-­
tion in clinical practice outlines a stepwise approach to treating risk factors
and intensifying treatment to help physicians and patients pursue riskfactor targets, taking into account patient profiles and preferences, ensur-­
ing targets are a part of a shared decision-making process involving


healthcare professionals and patients. [48] This stepwise approach starts
with assessing CVD risk in all patients with diabetes, including glycaemic
state and lifestyle risk-factor profile ( *Figure 13* ). CVD risk stratification
should be individually adapted according to comorbidities, e.g. CAD,
HF, AF, or PAD, as well as age, frailty, and sex. This includes discussing in-­
dividual preferences with the patient, particularly regarding lifestyle strat-­
egies and potential treatment benefits. Particularly in the field of T2DM,
studies have shown benefits of a stepwise approach to intensify treat-­
ment, and it appears that attaining treatment goals is similar, side effects
are fewer, and patient satisfaction is significantly higher with such an ap-­
proach. [369][,][370] Supporting evidence comes from the Italian Diabetes and
Exercise Study 2, which showed that a behavioural intervention strategy
compared with standard care resulted in a sustained increase in physical
activity and decrease in sedentary time among patients with T2DM. [371]

To achieve a high adherence and optimization of target goals, clinician–
patient communication is crucial and should include a personalized ap-­
proach explaining background and targets to improve understanding and
encourage lifestyle changes and drug-therapy adherence. Aside from the
disease entity, including symptoms, the patient’s ability to adopt a healthy
lifestyle depends on individual cognitive and emotional factors, educational
level, socioeconomic factors, and mental health. Perceived susceptibility to
illness and the anticipated severity of the consequences are also prominent
components of patients’ motivation. [372] Patients can be motivated by mo-­
tivational interviewing including the Open-ended questions, Affirmation,
Reflective listening, and Summarizing (OARS) and Specific, Measurable,
Achievable, Realistic, Timely (SMART) principles. [372][–][374] Multidisciplinary
behavioural approaches that combine the knowledge and skills of different
caregivers are recommended. [104] Adding exercise intervention combined
with psychological support to diet recommendations is more effective
than diet education alone. [375] Assessing depression and depressive symp-­
toms is important in patients with CVD and T2DM, as adequate treatment
improves adherence. [376][,][377]

Mobile phone applications may improve adherence to both medica-­
tion and behavioural changes, but more evidence, particularly in pa-­
tients with CVD and T2DM, is needed. [378] Regarding the education
method, individual education is more effective than face-to-face or
web and mobile phone education. [375] Whether a tailored and auto-­
mated text message (SMS) support programme may improve glycaemic
control in adults with poorly controlled diabetes is equivocal. [379]

**6.1. Chronic coronary syndromes and**
**diabetes**

**6.1.1. Clinical presentation**

Diabetes is a well-established risk factor for ischaemic heart disease

−
(IHD), and CAD accounts for 40 80% of deaths in patients with
T2DM. [148][,][359][,][381] In patients with CCS, T2DM is also associated
with an increased risk of the combined outcome (CV death, MI,
or stroke) with an adjusted HR of 1.28. [39] Studies show that clinical
symptoms of CAD in patients with diabetes are often less severe
and atypical in presentation. In the BARI 2D (Bypass Angioplasty
Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) trial in patients with
angiographically confirmed CAD and a mean diabetes duration of


10.4 years, typical angina, anginal equivalent, or a combination of
both were observed in 19%, 21%, and 42% of patients, respectively,
whereas 18% remained asymptomatic. [382][,][383] In 510 asymptomatic
patients with diabetes without prior CVD, computed tomography
(CT) revealed calcifications indicating the presence of coronary ath-­
erosclerosis in 46% of patients. [384] An even higher prevalence of
CAD was found in an autopsy study of asymptomatic decedents
with diabetes. [385]

**6.1.2. Screening and diagnosis**
For details about sensitivity, specificity, and pre-test probability of each
procedure in the assessment of CHD, we refer to the 2019 ESC
Guideline on chronic coronary syndromes. [299]

Screening for asymptomatic CAD in diabetes remains controversial.
Various RCTs evaluating the impact of routine screening for CAD in
asymptomatic patients with diabetes and no history of CAD showed

**4084** ESC Guidelines


no differences in CV outcomes at follow-up in those who underwent
routine screening compared with standard recommendations. [386][–][388]

Data from a meta-analysis of five RCTs with 3299 asymptomatic pa-­
tients with diabetes showed non-invasive CAD screening significantly
reduced the rate of any cardiac event by 27% (RR 0.73; 95% CI,
0.55–0.97; *P* = 0.028), driven by a non-significant reduction in non-fatal
MI (RR 0.65; *P* = 0.062) and hospitalization for HF (RR 0.61; *P* = 0.1).
Still, given the limitations of this analysis (e.g. different screening modal-­
ities, heterogenous patient populations), non-invasive, routine screen-­
ing for CAD in asymptomatic patients is not recommended. [389]

Moreover, in a recently published RCT involving men aged 65–74 years,
routine CVD screening did not significantly reduce the incidence of
death from any cause after a median follow-up of 5.6 years, also in a
pre-specified diabetes sub-group. [296]

**6.1.3. Management**
The comprehensive management of patients with diabetes and estab-­
lished CAD should start with a healthy lifestyle and reducing or elimin-­
ating modifiable risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, or
dyslipidaemia. The goal of pharmacotherapy should be to substantially
reduce serious CV events. Targets and pharmacotherapy for glycaemia,
BP, and LDL-C levels are addressed in the respective sections ( *Section*
*5.2, 5.4, and 5.5* ).

*6.1.3.1. Pharmacotherapy*
*6.1.3.1.1. Glucose-lowering medication.* Based on the results of vari-­
ous CVOTs, SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs are recommended in
patients with T2DM and CAD to reduce CV events ( *Section 5.3* ).

*6.1.3.1.2. Other medications.* Due to the diffuse nature of CAD,

some patients with diabetes are not amenable to revascularization.
Symptom relief might then be achieved by increasing myocardial oxy-­
gen supply with long-acting nitrates or CCBs, or by decreasing oxygen
demand with the help of beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine CCBs, ra-­
nolazine, or ivabradine. Note that none of these medications improves
mortality or the rate of ischaemic events. Beta-blockers with a simultan-­
eous vasodilatory effect (e.g. carvedilol, nebivolol, labetalol) may be pre-­
ferred due to their neutral or positive metabolic impact. [390][–][392]

Ranolazine, a drug that reduces myocardial ischaemia at the cellular le-­
vel, also has the unique effect of reducing HbA1c, especially in patients
with poor metabolic control. [393][,][394] In normotensive patients with dia-­
betes and CAD, ACE-Is or ARBs are also recommended to reduce the
risk of CV events, especially in patients with HF or CKD. [395][–][397]

*6.1.3.2. Revascularization*

In patients with diabetes, the indications for myocardial revasculariza-­
tion are the same as those in patients without diabetes, the essential as-­
pects of which are reported in the 2018 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on
myocardial revascularization and 2019 ESC Guideline on chronic cor-­
onary syndromes. [299][,][308] A detailed description of the evidence from
outcome trials on revascularization in patients with diabetes can be
[found in Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Section 3.1.1* . In brief, given the cur-­
rent knowledge, in patients with diabetes and multivessel disease,
CABG with arterial grafts is preferred over complex PCI, providing
that patient characteristics (e.g. frailty, cerebrovascular disease) are
considered. [398] PCI with newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES),
whenever possible, is acceptable for patients with less-extensive dis-­
ease (i.e. single-vessel disease or two-vessel disease not involving the
left anterior descending, and those with SYNTAX Score ≤22). Thus,


the extent of CAD, lesion complexity, and the risk of major surgery
are key points in the decision-making process. Because most of the
trials on revascularization contained patients with T2DM, current
Guidelines cannot easily be applied to patients with T1DM. It has
now been demonstrated that CABG is also superior to PCI in patients
with T1DM and multivessel CAD. [399]

**6.2. Acute coronary syndromes and**
**diabetes**

**6.2.1. Clinical presentation and diagnosis**

Diabetes is a frequent comorbidity in patients hospitalized for ACS,
with an increasing prevalence over the last decade and a high mortality
rate. [409] Among patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial in-­
farction (STEMI), ∼25% have a history of diabetes and more than
40% show a previously undiagnosed T2DM or pre-diabetes. [410]

Patients with diabetes more often present with non-typical symptoms
compared with those without diabetes, and this impacts prompt diag-­
nosis and treatment. [411] Moreover, patients with diabetes frequently
have multivessel disease and multiple coronary lesions, with a higher
percentage of highly vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques associated
with impaired microvasculature vasodilation. [412][,][413]

ESC Guidelines **4085**


**6.2.2. Management**
*6.2.2.1. Pharmacotherapy*

Patients with diabetes and ACS, despite the poor prognosis and high
prevalence of comorbidities, are less likely to receive appropriate treat-­
ment such as revascularization, reperfusion, or adequate DAPT. [414][,][415]

One of the reasons may be the lack of typical symptoms. [416] While few
studies have focused exclusively on patients with diabetes, analyses of
studies indicate that guideline-directed pharmacotherapy provides pa-­
tients with diabetes similar or improved absolute benefits compared
with patients without diabetes, yet the incidence of events remains con-­
stantly higher in those with vs. without diabetes. [309][,][312][,][417]

*6.2.2.2. Glucose control in patients with acute coronary syndrome*
Patients with ACS and hyperglycaemia on admission to hospital have a high-­
er risk of death than patients with ACS without hyperglycaemia, irrespect-­
ive of diabetes status. [418] Mortality correlates more strongly to the blood
glucose level than to the presence of diabetes. [419][,][420] Thus, early assessment
of blood glucose level is strongly recommended in all subjects, although
there is insufficient evidence that intensive glycaemic control improves
prognosis. The DIGAMI 1 trial showed that early, tight glycaemic control
with intravenous (i.v.) insulin–glucose infusion followed by subcutaneous in-­
jections significantly reduced 1-year mortality compared with conventional
glucose-lowering treatment. [421] Conversely, the DIGAMI 2 study, and later
pooled analyses of studies on insulin–glucose infusions did not confirm this
observation. [146][,][422] Other studies have shown that adequate glycaemic con-­
trol improves the prognosis of patients with ACS, while also demonstrating
the importance of avoiding hypoglycaemia, which is strongly associated
with worse outcomes. [423][,][424] A criticism of previous studies is the inad-­
equate characterization of glycaemia, with most studies analysing HbA1c
as the glycaemic marker, when both hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability
potentially have a role in CV pathology.

Considering all evidence, it is best to attempt moderately tight gly-­
caemic control while avoiding hypoglycaemia in the early hours of

ACS. Continuous insulin infusion should be limited to cases where the

optimal glycaemic control cannot be achieved otherwise; blood glucose
level should be maintained <11.1 mmol/L (<200 mg/dL) or
<10.0 mmol/L (<180 mg/dL) according to some recommenda-­
tions. [425][–][427] Frequent blood glucose testing, preferably hourly during
the acute ACS phase, will help to avoid hypoglycaemia. CGM provides
comprehensive glucose data while being more convenient than blood
glucose testing, and the LIBERATES (Improving Glucose Control in
Patients with Diabetes Following Myocardial Infarction: The Role of a
Novel Glycaemia Monitoring Strategy) RCT in 141 insulin- or
sulphonylurea-treated patients with T2DM and ACS showed that
CGM over 3 months significantly reduced hypoglycaemic exposure
compared with traditional capillary glucose testing, while being equally
effective at reducing HbA1c. [428] In the EMMY (Impact of EMpagliflozin
on cardiac function and biomarkers of heart failure in patients with acute
MYocardial infarction) trial, 467 patients were randomized to empagli-­
flozin 10 mg or placebo within 72 h of PCI for acute MI. [429] The study
drug was associated with a significantly greater N-terminal pro-B-type
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reduction over 26 weeks (primary
outcome) and a significant improvement in echocardiographic LV para-­
meters, without demonstrating any difference in adverse events of spe-­
cial interest including metabolic acidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis. [429]

It should be noted that hyperglycaemia in the acute phase of ACS
might reflect stress hyperglycaemia and is not enough to diagnose dia-­
betes. These patients should be further evaluated after discharge
( *Section 3* ).

Antithrombotic medication in patients with ACS is further described

in *Section 5.6* .

*6.2.2.3. Reperfusion strategies in ST-elevation myocardial infarction*

The therapeutic strategy in patients with diabetes presenting with
STEMI should not differ from that for patients without diabetes. As
for the general population, prognosis is determined by early and effect-­
ive reperfusion. Since patients with diabetes are more likely to present
with atypical symptoms, reperfusion is often undertaken late. [431]

Although, patients with diabetes and STEMI, compared with those
without diabetes, are older, more often have multivessel disease and
concomitant conditions, and are less likely to receive reperfusion ther-­
apy. Diabetes is regarded as an independent risk factor of early and late
mortality. [432][–][436] Primary angioplasty, performed in a timely fashion,
also provides the best clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes. [437]

Several recent studies indicate the clinical benefit of early, single-stage,
complete revascularization in patients with non-ST-elevation ACS
(NSTE-ACS) and early complete revascularization in those with
STEMI and multivessel disease. [403][–][407][,][432][–][435] The exception is patients
in cardiogenic shock, where it is recommended to limit the procedure
to the infarct-related artery. [408] Adding proton pump inhibitors, limiting
use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and avoiding heparin in patients on
OACs if the international normalized ratio (INR) >2.5 are
recommended. [308]

*6.2.2.4. Optimal timing of invasive strategy in non-ST-elevation acute*
*coronary syndrome*

In patients with diabetes and NSTE-ACS, the indications and timing of
revascularization should not differ from those for patients without dia-­
betes. [438] Multiple studies have indicated that an early invasive strategy is
beneficial in high-risk sub-groups. [439][–][442] Since diabetes is one of the risk
factors of poor prognosis, patients with diabetes may benefit signifi-­
cantly more from the early invasive approach than those without dia-­
betes. [417][,][443] In a meta-analysis of eight RCTs in patients with
NSTE-ACS, which compared an early vs. a delayed invasive strategy,
diabetes, elevated troponin, and a Global Registry of Acute Coronary
Events (GRACE) risk score >140 predicted lower mortality in the early
invasive arm. [444]

**4086** ESC Guidelines


According to current guidelines, an immediate invasive strategy
(within 2 h from admission) should be applied to very high-risk patients,
mostly with electrical or haemodynamic instability. [426] These patients
were excluded from all major randomized ACS trials. In addition, pa-­
tients with severe symptoms, refractory to medical therapy, or those
with electrocardiogram (ECG) signs suggesting the left main stem as
a culprit vessel should be promptly referred for coronary angiography.
An early invasive strategy (within 24 h) should be applied to high-risk
patients, especially those with markedly elevated troponins, dynamic
ST/T-segment changes, transient ST-segment elevation, or a GRACE
risk score >140.

#### **7. Heart failure and diabetes**

**7.1. Definition and pathophysiology**
Heart failure is not a single pathological disease but a clinical syndrome
with current or prior symptoms and/or signs caused by a structural and/
or functional cardiac abnormality. It is corroborated by elevated natri-­
uretic peptides and/or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or
systemic congestion from diagnostic modalities, such as imaging or in-­
vasive haemodynamic measurements. [445]

Heart failure is one of the most common initial manifestations of

CVD in patients with T2DM, and may present as HFpEF, heart failure
with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), or HFrEF ( *Table 9* ). [446]

Major causes of HF in diabetes are IHD ( *Section 6* ), hypertension
( *Section 5.3* ), direct or indirect effects of hyperglycaemia, and obesity
and related factors on the myocardium. [447][,][448] IHD is often accelerated,
severe, diffuse, and silent, and increases the risk of MI and ischaemic

myocardial dysfunction. [449][–][452] Observational data have also identified
that lower-extremity artery disease (LEAD), longer diabetes duration,
ageing, increased BMI, and CKD ( *Section 9* ) are associated with HF in
patients with diabetes ( *Table 10* ). [449][–][452] Complex pathophysiological
mechanisms may be responsible for the development of myocardial
dysfunction, even in the absence of IHD or hypertension. [453] For dec-­
ades, the concept of diabetic cardiomyopathy has been discussed,
with mostly experimental and smaller observational studies suggesting
its presence; however, its existence has so far not been con-­
firmed. [447][,][454][–][458]

**7.2. Epidemiology and prognosis**
Diabetes is an important risk factor for HF. [459] Observational studies have
consistently demonstrated a two- to four-fold increased risk of HF in in-­
dividuals with diabetes compared with those without diabetes. [460][–][463]

The prevalence of chronic HF increases steadily with age for patients
with and without diabetes. Patients with T2DM develop chronic HF
more often and earlier in life than those without T2DM, with an incre-­
mental risk inversely associated with age; for example, in one study,
the incident rate ratio was 11.0 (95% CI, 5.6–21.8) for those <45 years,
declining to 1.8 (95% CI, 1.6–2.2) for those aged 75–84 years, reflecting
the higher absolute HF risk in elderly patients without diabetes. [463]

Unrecognized HF is frequent in T2DM: a cross-sectional study in patients
aged ≥60 years with T2DM without known HF using a standardized diag-­
nostic work-up, including medical history, physical examination, ECG,
and echocardiography, indicated that HF was present in 28% of patients
(∼25% HFrEF and ∼75% HFpEF). [460][–][464]

Vice versa, HF is associated with a diabetes incidence of 20–30 per
1000 person-years in the first 5 years following HF hospitalization,
which is substantially higher than for adults in the general population
(10.1 per 1000 person-years). [465][,][466] A large, pan-European registry
found that ∼36% of all outpatients with stable HF had diabetes, while
in patients hospitalized for acute HF for whom i.v. therapy (inotropes,
vasodilators, or diuretics) was needed, diabetes was present in up to
50%. [467][,][468] In addition, available data from observational studies dem-­
onstrate that diabetes prevalence in patients with HF is similar, irre-­
spective of LVEF category. [469][,][470]

A significant association exists between diabetes and a higher risk of
adverse outcomes in patients with HF, with the greatest incremental risk
associated with diabetes observed in patients with HFrEF. [467][,][471][–][475]

However, CV mortality, including death caused by worsening HF, is
also 50–90% higher in patients with HF and diabetes compared

with HF patients without diabetes, regardless of HF phenotype. [471][,][475][–][477]

In patients with acute HF, for whom i.v. therapy (inotropes, vasodi-­
lators, or diuretics) was needed, diabetes was associated with higher
risk of in-hospital death, 1 year all-cause death, and 1 year HF
re-hospitalization. [468][,][478]

**7.3. Screening and diagnosis**
Patients with diabetes are at risk of HF but not all patients with diabetes
will develop HF. [479] Given that the prognosis of patients with both co-­
morbidities is worse, it is of utmost importance to screen all patients
with diabetes for HF to allow early implementation of life-saving therapies.
To predict the HF risk among outpatients with T2DM, the WATCH-DM
(Weight [BMI], Age, Hypertension, Creatinine, HDL-C, Diabetes control

[fasting plasma glucose], QRS duration, MI, and CABG) risk score has
been developed. [480] Each increment of 1 unit in the risk score is associated
with a 24% higher HF risk within 5 years. In addition, a biomarker-based

risk score including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ≥6 ng/L,
NT-proBNP ≥125 pg/mL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥3 mg/L,
and LV hypertrophy by ECG (with one point for each abnormal param-­
eter) demonstrated good discrimination and calibration for predicting 5and 10-year HF risk among patients with diabetes. The highest 5-year risk
of HF was noted among those with scores ≥3. [481] The Heart Failure

Association of the ESC reviewed the clinical evidence and value of further
biomarker testing and currently recommends no further testing. [482]

To detect transition from being at risk of HF to developing HF, the
following regular evaluation is recommended in patients with diabetes
( *Figure 14* ):

- Regularly, a systematic survey for HF symptoms (breathlessness, dys-­

2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and
chronic heart failure. [445]

If one or more of the symptoms or signs above is present, HF can be
suspected, and the following diagnostic tests are recommended:

- Measurement of natriuretic peptides is recommended, if available.
Values below the following cut-offs make the diagnosis of HF unlikely
and other diagnoses should be considered: [483][–][485]

 - B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) <35 pg/mL (threshold in AF:
<105 pg/mL).

 - NT-proBNP <125 pg/mL (threshold in AF: <365 pg/mL).

However, natriuretic peptide concentrations may be disproportion-­
ately low in patients with obesity or in women, and disproportionately
high in patients with advanced CKD, advanced age, or AF. [486][,][487] Still,
elevated concentrations support the diagnosis of HF and may guide fur-­
ther cardiac investigation. [488]

- ECG is recommended to detect abnormalities such as AF, signs of LV
hypertrophy, Q waves, or widened QRS, each of which may be a sign
of HF. [489]

- Echocardiography is recommended to assess cardiac function includ-­

ing LV function, chamber size, LV hypertrophy, regional wall motion
abnormalities (that may suggest CAD), right ventricular function, es-­
timated pulmonary pressure, valvular function, and markers of diastol-­
ic dysfunction. Transthoracic echocardiography may be considered to
detect HF in patients with diabetes if other risk factors arise.

- Chest X-ray is recommended to investigate other causes of dys-­

pnoea (e.g. pulmonary disease). It may provide supportive evidence
of HF (e.g. cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion).

- Routine blood tests (including full blood count, urea, creatinine, and
electrolytes, thyroid and liver function, lipids, and iron status (ferritin
and transferrin saturation) are recommended to differentiate HF
from other conditions, to obtain prognostic information, and to
guide potential therapy. Additional diagnostic tests should be consid-­
ered if other specific diagnoses are suspected (e.g. amyloidosis).

- If HF is confirmed, additional diagnostic tests are recommended as
summarized in the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treat-­
ment of acute and chronic heart failure. [445]

**7.4. Treatment of heart failure in patients**

**7.4.1. Treatment of heart failure with reduced**

**ejection fraction**
Treatment of HFrEF encompasses therapeutic lifestyle modifications, as
well as pharmacological and device therapies with benefits confirmed in
RCTs, in which 30–40% of patients had diabetes. Treatment effects of
medications and devices for HFrEF have been consistently demon-­
strated to not differ in patients with vs. without diabetes. Importantly,
while the RR reductions are consistently similar for those with and with-­
out diabetes, given the higher absolute HFrEF clinical risk associated with
diabetes, the ARR in patients with diabetes is typically higher, yielding a
lower NNT for benefit among patients with diabetes.

The cornerstone of treatment for HFrEF is pharmacotherapy along-­
side lifestyle interventions, which should be implemented before con-­
sidering device therapy. The recent 2021 ESC Guidelines for the
diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure recommend
starting quadruple therapy (angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor

[ARNI]/ACE-I, MRA, beta-blocker, SGLT2 inhibitor). [445] These four
foundational treatments should be initiated early, as much of the ben-­
efits are seen within 30 days of starting treatment, and adding new
drugs yields greater benefits than up-titrating existing drug classes. In
the STRONG-HF (Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Rapid
Optimization, Helped by NT-proBNP testinG, of Heart Failure
Therapies) trial, 1078 patients with acute HF, 29% of whom had dia-­
betes at baseline, were assigned to either high-intensity care with up
titration of treatments to 100% of recommended doses within 2 weeks
of discharge or to usual care. [490] Safety and tolerability were assessed at
weeks 1, 2, 3, and 6 by full physical examination and laboratory assess-­
ments of NT-proBNP, sodium, potassium, glucose, kidney function, and
haemoglobin measures. The study was stopped early due to a greater
than expected between-group difference. The primary endpoint, con-­
sisting of 180-day re-admission to hospital due to HF or all-cause death,
was significantly reduced in the high-intensity group, with a RR reduc-­
tion of 34% (HR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.86) with similar incidences of ser-­
ious adverse events. Of note, no sub-group analysis exists on patients
with diabetes. Based on these data, an intensive strategy of early initi-­
ation of evidence-based treatment (SGLT2 inhibitors, ARNI/ACE-Is,
beta-blockers, and MRAs), with rapid up-titration to trial-defined target
doses and frequent follow-up visits in the first 6 weeks following dis-­
charge from a HF hospitalization is recommended to reduce
re-admissions or mortality. The sequence of therapy initiation should
be based on the individual patient phenotype taking into account BP,
heart rhythm, and heart rate, as well as kidney function and risk of hy-­
perkalaemia. While the start dose of SGLT2 inhibitors is the same as the
target dose, ARNI/ACE-Is, beta-blockers, and MRAs should be started
at low dose and up-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose. For more
details on HFrEF therapy, please refer to the 2021 ESC Guidelines for
the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. [445] The

specific characteristics for patients with diabetes are presented in the
following sections.

*7.4.1.1. Sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors*

Two randomized placebo-controlled trials have investigated the effect of
an SGLT2 inhibitor compared with placebo added to optimal medical
therapy (OMT) in patients with HFrEF with and without diabetes. The
DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in
Heart Failure) trial included patients if they were in New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class II–IV, had an LVEF ≤40% despite OMT, and
had elevated NT-proBNP (in sinus rhythm ≥600 pg/mL, in AF
≥900 mg/mL, or ≥400 pg/mL if they had been hospitalized for HF within
the previous 12 months). Patients with T1DM or an eGFR <30 mL/min/
1.73 m [2 ] were excluded. Therapy with dapagliflozin 10 mg o.d. vs. placebo
reduced the risk of the primary outcome, a composite of worsening
HF (hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in i.v. therapy for HF) or
CV death, by 26% (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65–0.85). In addition, dapagliflozin
reduced all-cause mortality (HR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.97) and improved
symptoms, physical function, and quality of life in patients with
HFrEF. [491][,][492] All of the clinical benefits observed were independent of
baseline diabetes status and background glucose-lowering therapy,
and consistent across the spectrum of HbA1c. [491][,][493] The EMPERORReduced (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart
Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction) trial evaluated empagliflozin vs.
placebo and included patients with HFrEF with and without diabetes,
with NYHA class II–IV, and LVEF ≤40% despite OMT, an eGFR
≥20 mL/min/1.73 m [2], and an elevated NT-proBNP (EF ≤30% or EF
≤40% and HF hospitalization within 12 months: NT-proBNP ≥600 pg/
mL; EF 31–35%: NT-proBNP ≥1000 pg/mL; EF 36–40%: NT-proBNP
≥2500 pg/mL). Empagliflozin 10 mg o.d. reduced the risk of the primary
outcome, a composite of CV death or HF hospitalization, by 25% vs. pla-­
cebo (HR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65–0.86). [494] This effect was consistent across
patients with and without diabetes at baseline. [495] Treatment with empa-­
gliflozin improved quality of life. [496] A meta-analysis of the DAPA-HF and
EMPEROR-Reduced trials showed a consistent reduction in HF hospital-­
ization or CV death, CV death, and all-cause mortality by SGLT2-inhibitor
treatment without significant heterogeneity between trials. [497]

The combined SGLT1 and -2 inhibitor sotagliflozin was investigated
in patients with T2DM who were recently hospitalized for worsening
HF, irrespective of their LVEF (SOLOIST-WHF [Effect of Sotagliflozin
on Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Post
Worsening Heart Failure] trial). Patients with an eGFR <30 mL/min/
1.73 m [2 ] were excluded. Sotagliflozin significantly reduced the RR of the
composite primary outcome (CV death, HF hospitalization, or urgent visit
for HF) by 33% compared with placebo (HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.85). The
treatment effect was consistent across the spectrum of LVEF. [189]

Thus, the SGLT inhibitors dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflo-­
zin are recommended, in addition to OMT (with an ARNI/ACE-I, betablocker, and MRA), in patients with HFrEF and diabetes to reduce CV
death and HF hospitalization.

Three studies have investigated whether SGLT2 inhibitors can be safely
started in patients hospitalized for acute HF. The EMPA-RESPONSE-AHF
(Effects of Empagliflozin on Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Acute
Decompensated Heart Failure) trial randomized 80 patients with acute
HF with (approximately one-third) and without diabetes to either empa-­
gliflozin or placebo for 30 days. [498] Treatment with empagliflozin did not
affect visual analogue scale dyspnoea, diuretic response, NT-proBNP le-­
vels, or duration of hospital stay, but was safe, increased urinary output,
and reduced a combined endpoint of worsening HF, re-hospitalization


for HF, or death at 60 days compared with placebo. In the
SOLOIST-WHF trial mentioned above, 1222 patients with T2DM re-­
ceived sotagliflozin or placebo, with a median follow-up of 9 months (trial
stopped prematurely). [189] Sotagliflozin therapy, initiated before or shortly
after discharge, resulted in significantly fewer deaths from CV causes and
hospitalizations and urgent visits for HF than placebo, with no increase in
acute kidney injury. The EMPULSE (A Study to Test the Effect of
Empagliflozin in Patients Who Are in Hospital for Acute Heart Failure) trial
randomized 530 hospitalized patients with and without diabetes with a pri-­
mary diagnosis of acute *de novo* or decompensated HF, regardless of LVEF
when clinically stable, to receive either empagliflozin or placebo. More pa-­
tients treated with empagliflozin had clinical benefit (win ratio 1.36; 95% CI,
1.09–1.68) compared with placebo. This effect was consistent for acute *de*
*novo* and decompensated chronic HF and was observed regardless of LVEF
or the presence of diabetes. [499] In these trials, very few cases of euglycaemic
diabetic ketoacidosis were reported; still, physicians treating patients with
diabetes with SGLT2 inhibitors in this setting should be aware of this rare
but potentially serious complication. Of note, misinterpreting eGFR
changes can lead to inappropriate discontinuation of disease-modifying
agents and should be avoided.

*7.4.1.2. Angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor and*
*angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors*
The ARNI sacubitril/valsartan has shown superior efficacy to enalapril in
reducing CV death and HF hospitalization in patients with HFrEF, with
or without diabetes. [471] Patients were up-titrated to 200 mg b.i.d. sacu-­
bitril/valsartan within 2–4 weeks. [471] The beneficial effect of sacubitril/
valsartan over enalapril was consistent for patients with and without
diabetes and across the spectrum of baseline HbA1c.

ACE-Is were the first class of drugs shown to reduce mortality and
morbidity and improve symptoms in patients with HFrEF. [500] There is
no difference in efficacy in patients with and without diabetes. [501][–][503]

As RAS inhibitors increase the risk of hyperkalaemia and may acutely
compromise kidney function, routine surveillance of serum creatinine
and potassium levels is advised. [504][,][505] However, misinterpreting eGFR
changes often leads to inappropriate discontinuation of diseasemodifying agents and should be avoided. [504][–][506]

*7.4.1.3. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists*

The steroidal MRAs spironolactone or eplerenone reduce death and
HF hospitalization in patients with HFrEF, with consistent results in pa-­
tients with or without diabetes. [507][,][508] Eplerenone is more specific for
blocking aldosterone and, therefore, causes less gynaecomastia.
Caution should be exercised when using MRAs in patients with im-­
paired renal function and in those with serum potassium concentration
>5.0 mmol/L. The non-steroidal MRA finerenone has not been investi-­
gated in patients with HFrEF ( *Section 9* ).

*7.4.1.4. Beta-blockers*

Beta-blockers are effective at reducing all-cause death and hospitaliza-­
tion for HF in patients with HFrEF, with or without diabetes. [509][–][512]

Treatment benefits strongly support using beta-blockers in patients
with HFrEF and diabetes.

*7.4.1.5. Angiotensin-II receptor blockers*

The place of ARBs in managing HFrEF has changed over the last few
years. They are now recommended for patients who cannot tolerate
ARNI or ACE-Is because of serious side effects. ARBs have similar treat-­
ment effects in patients with HFrEF with or without diabetes. [513][–][515]

**4090** ESC Guidelines


*7.4.1.6. Ivabradine*

Ivabradine slows heart rate by inhibiting the I f channel in the sinus node
and is therefore only effective in patients in sinus rhythm. Ivabradine re-­
duced the combined endpoint of CV death or HF hospitalization irre-­
spective of diabetes status. [516]

*7.4.1.7. Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate*
There is no evidence to support the use of this fixed-dose combination ther-­
apy in all patients with HFrEF, but rather limited to self-identified Black pa-­
tients as per product labelling. An RCT in self-identified Black patients with
HFrEF showed that adding the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide di-­
nitrate to conventional therapy (ACE-I, beta-blocker, MRA) reduced mortal-­
ity and HF hospitalization in patients in NYHA class III–IV. [517] The beneficial
effects were consistent in patients with or without diabetes. [518]

*7.4.1.8. Digoxin*

Digoxin may reduce the risk of HF hospitalization in patients with
HFrEF treated with ACE-Is, irrespective of diabetes status. [519]

*7.4.1.9. Diuretics*

Despite a lack of evidence for the efficacy of either thiazide or loop
diuretics in reducing CV outcomes in patients with HF, diuretics pre-­
vent and treat symptoms and signs of fluid congestion in patients
with HF. [520] Importantly, a judicious use of diuretic therapy including al-­
ternating dosing over time is warranted. [521]

*7.4.1.10. Device therapy and surgery*
Device therapies (implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD], cardiac
resynchronization therapy [CRT], and CRT with an implantable defib-­
rillator [CRT-D]) have similar efficacies and risks in patients with HFrEF
with or without diabetes. [522][–][525] These therapies should be considered
according to treatment guidelines in the HFrEF population. Heart trans-­
plantation could be considered in end-stage HF, but a large, prospective
study of transplanted patients indicated a decreased likelihood of
10-year survival in those with diabetes. [526]

ESC Guidelines **4091**


HFrEF or HFpEF indicate that patients with a LVEF between 40–50%
benefitted from similar therapies to those with LVEF ≤40%. [445]

However, to date, no definitive RCT has evaluated therapies exclusively
in patients with HFmrEF. The best evidence so far derives from
SGLT2-inhibitor studies. The EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin
Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure With

Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial included patients with NYHA class
II–IV, an LVEF >40%, and an elevated NT-proBNP (>300 pg/mL in si-­
nus rhythm; >900 pg/mL in AF). [530] Patients with an eGFR <20 mL/
min/1.73 m [2 ] were excluded. Compared with placebo, empagliflozin re-­
duced the risk of the primary outcome, a composite of CV death or
hospitalization for HF, by 21%, which was mainly related to a 29% lower
risk of hospitalization for HF. [530] This effect was independent of diabetes
status, and baseline HbA1c did not modify the effects on the primary
outcome. [531] The DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the
Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure) trial in-­
cluded 6263 patients with NYHA class II–IV, an LVEF >40%, an elevated
NT-proBNP (>300 pg/mL in sinus rhythm; >600 pg/mL in AF), and an
eGFR ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m [2] . Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin re-­
duced the primary outcome, a composite of worsening HF or CV
death, by 18%, which was mainly driven by a reduction in hospitalization
for HF. This effect was independent of diabetes status. [532] A
meta-analysis including 12 251 participants from DELIVER and
EMPEROR-Preserved showed that SGLT2 inhibitors, compared with
placebo, reduced a composite of CV death and first hospitalization
for HF (HR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73–0.87), with consistent reductions in
both components: CV death (HR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77–1.00) and first
hospitalization for HF (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.67–0.83). [533]

There is no specific trial evaluating ARNI in patients with HFmrEF.
The PARAGON-HF trial, which included patients with EF ≥45%, al-­
though missing its primary endpoint overall, showed significant
EF-by-treatment interaction. Sacubitril/valsartan, compared with valsar-­
tan, reduced the likelihood of the primary composite outcome of CV
death and total HF hospitalization by 22% in those with an LVEF below
or equal to the median of 57%. [534]

**7.4.3. Treatment of heart failure with preserved**
**ejection fraction**
Over the past decade, several large RCTs failed to achieve statistical sig-­
nificance with regard to effects on the primary outcomes in patients
with HFpEF including: PEP-CHF (perindopril), CHARM-Preserved (can-­
desartan), I-PRESERVE (irbesartan), TOPCAT (spironolactone), DIG
Ancillary Trial (digoxin), and PARAGON-HF (sacubitril/valsar-­
tan). [477][,][534][–][538] As presented above in section 7.4.2, the SGLT2 inhibi-­
tors empagliflozin and dapagliflozin both reduced the RR of the
primary composite outcome, CV death or hospitalization for HF, by
21% and 18%, respectively. [530][,][532] The treatment effect on the incidence
of the primary outcome did not differ between LVEF sub-groups nor
between patients with and without diabetes. [531][–][533] The combined
SGLT1 and -2 inhibitor sotagliflozin was investigated in patients with
T2DM who were recently hospitalized for worsening HF, irrespective
of their LVEF (SOLOIST-WHF trial); 20.9% of the patients had an
LVEF ≥50%. Sotagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite
outcome of CV death, HF hospitalization, and urgent visit for HF by
33%, with a consistent effect across the spectrum of baseline LVEF.
However, the number of events in the HFpEF group was too small
to draw any firm conclusion. [189]

Diuretic therapy should be used to reduce symptoms of conges-­
tion. [520] Loop diuretics are preferred, but low-dose thiazide diuretics


might be useful for managing hypertension. For treating comorbidities
alongside HFpEF, refer to the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis
and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. [445]

For glycaemic targets in patients with diabetes, please refer to *Section*

*5.2* .

**7.5.1. Sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors**

Sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (see also *Section 7.4.1.1* )
have been investigated in different populations with diabetes, ranging
from patients with ASCVD or multiple ASCVD risk factors to patients
recently hospitalized for worsening HF, with increasing ARR for
HF-related outcomes according to higher patient risk ( *Figure 15;*
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S15* ).

As outlined above, in dedicated HF trials, dapagliflozin and empagli-­
flozin reduced CV death and HF hospitalization in patients with
HFrEF with or without diabetes, and sotagliflozin reduced CV death
and HF hospitalization in patients with T2DM and recent hospitalization
for HF of any aetiology. [189][,][491][,][494] Moreover, empagliflozin and dapagli-­
flozin reduced the risk of CV death or HF hospitalization in patients
with HFmrEF or HFpEF. [530][,][532]

While the EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin) and VERTIS CV
(ertugliflozin) trials investigated patients with T2DM and established
ASCVD risk, the CANVAS Programme (canagliflozin) and
DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial (dapagliflozin) included patients with
established ASCVD or multiple ASCVD risk factors. In all of these
placebo-controlled CVOTs of SGLT2 inhibitors, only a small proportion
of patients had a baseline history of HF. Empagliflozin reduced the risk of
HF hospitalization by 35% in patients with and without previous HF. [71]

Canagliflozin also significantly reduced the risk of HF hospitalization
by 33%. [151] Dapagliflozin significantly reduced the combined endpoint
of CV death or HF hospitalization, a result driven mainly by lower rates
of HF hospitalization. [152] This effect was independent of pre-existing
HF. [540] Ertugliflozin did not reduce the combined endpoint of CV death
or HF hospitalization, although there was a significant reduction in HF
hospitalization and repeated hospitalizations. [154][,][541]

in SOLOIST-WHF. [189] Figure adapted from Butler *et al.* 2021. [539]


In addition, four trials investigated the effect of SGLT2 inhibition in pa-­
tients with CKD: CREDENCE (with canagliflozin) and SCORED (with so-­
tagliflozin) in patients with T2DM; DAPA-CKD (with dapagliflozin) and
EMPA-KIDNEY (with empagliflozin) in patients with and without diabetes.
In these patients at high risk of HF, a consistent risk reduction of CV death
or HF hospitalization was observed ranging from 23% to 31%. [150][,][153][,][542][,][543]

A meta-analysis of six outcome trials of four SGLT2 inhibitors in pa-­
tients with T2DM (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS Programme

[two trials], DECLARE-TIMI-58, CREDENCE, VERTIS CV) demon-­
strated a 32% reduction in HF hospitalization, with no heterogeneity
between trials; the effect on HF hospitalization was independent of
ASCVD. [155] Thus, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for patients
with T2DM and multiple ASCVD risk factors or established ASCVD
to reduce HF hospitalization.


**7.5.2. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists**

Eight CVOTs have been completed with GLP-1 RAs in patients with
T2DM, and the prevalence of established HF in these trials ranged

from 9% to 24%. Most GLP-1 RAs had a neutral effect on risk of HF

hospitalization in the placebo-controlled RCTs assessing CV safety of
glucose-lowering medications in patients with T2DM with or at high
risk of ASCVD, despite increasing heart rate by 3–5 b.p.m. [70][,][72][,][158][– ]

163,544 In addition, two meta-analyses including eight trials comprising
60 080 patients found HF hospitalization to be reduced by 10–11%
by GLP-1 RA compared with placebo. [164][,][545]

The AMPLITUDE-O trial, comparing efpeglenatide with placebo,
showed a nominally significant benefit on hospitalization for HF. The
trial included stratified randomization by baseline or anticipated use
of SGLT2 inhibitors and had the highest prevalence (15.2%) of

ESC Guidelines **4093**


SGLT2 inhibitor use among GLP-1 RA trials. Data from an exploratory
analysis of the AMPLITUDE-O trial suggest that the efficacy and safety
of efpeglenatide was independent of concurrent SGLT2 inhibitor use,
including HF hospitalization. [546]

Only three small RCTs of GLP-1 RAs have been conducted in pa-­
tients with HFrEF. [547] The LIVE trial randomly assigned 241 patients
with chronic, stable HFrEF with or without DM to placebo or liraglu-­
tide. [548] While no changes in LVEF, quality of life, or functional class
were noted after 24 weeks of treatment, more serious adverse cardiac

events (sustained ventricular tachycardia, AF requiring intervention, and
aggravation of IHD; 12 [10%] vs. 3 [3%] for liraglutide and placebo, re-­
spectively; *P* = 0.04) occurred in the liraglutide group. The FIGHT trial
(Functional Impact of GLP1 for HF Treatment) randomly assigned 300
patients with and without DM with HFrEF and a recent hospitalization
for HF to liraglutide or placebo. Following 180 days of treatment, the
primary outcome (time to death, time to re-hospitalization for HF,
and time-averaged proportional change in NT-proBNP level from base-­
line to 180 days) was not different between groups. In addition, there
was a non-significant between-group difference in the number of rehospitalizations for HF (63 [41%] in the liraglutide group vs. 50 [34%]
in the placebo group; HR 1.30, 95% CI, 0.89–1.88; *P* = 0.17). [549] The
third trial was a small ( *n* = 82), randomized study evaluating 12 weeks
of albiglutide vs. placebo in patients with HFrEF. No significant differ-­
ences were seen in LVEF, 6 min walk test, myocardial glucose utilization,
or oxygen use. [550] The study was too small and too short to evaluate

clinical outcomes.

**7.5.3. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors**

Four DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, and linagliptin)
have been examined in dedicated placebo-controlled CV safety trials
in patients with T2DM with or at high risk of ASCVD. Saxagliptin signifi-­
cantly increased the risk of HF hospitalization [172] and is not recom-­
mended in patients with DM with or at increased risk of HF.
Alogliptin was associated with a non-significant trend towards an in-­
crease in HF hospitalization. [173] Sitagliptin and linagliptin had a neutral
effect. [174][,][178][–][180] Vildagliptin, not tested in a CVOT, had no significant
effect on LVEF but led to an increase in LV volumes in a small trial. [551]

**7.5.4. Insulin**

In patients with T2DM and advanced HF, insulin use is independently
associated with a significantly worse prognosis. [552] Two basal insulins
have been formally evaluated in dedicated CV outcomes trials. In the
ORIGIN trial, 12 537 patients (mean age 63.5 years) at high CV risk,
with IFG, IGT, or T2DM, were randomized to insulin glargine titrated
to a fasting blood glucose level of ≤5.3 mmol/L (≤95 mg/dL) or stand-­
ard care. After a median follow-up of 6.2 years, insulin glargine was


neutral in its effect on HF hospitalizations. [553] The DEVOTE rando-­
mized trial, a double-blind comparison of the ultra-long-acting, oncedaily insulin degludec vs. insulin glargine U100, enrolled 7637 patients
with T2DM with ASCVD or at high CV risk. [181] Treatment with insulin
degludec vs. insulin glargine did not differ with respect to HF hospital-­
ization; prior HF was independently associated with future HF
hospitalization. [554]

**7.5.5. Metformin**

Metformin is suggested to be safe at all stages of HF with preserved or
stable, moderately reduced kidney function (i.e. eGFR >30 mL/min/
1.73 m [2] ). It is associated with a lower risk of death and HF hospitaliza-­
tion compared with insulin and sulphonylureas in observational studies,
though dedicated randomized, controlled, CVOTs evaluating safety and
efficacy of metformin have not been conducted. [555][–][557] Concerns re-­
garding lactic acidosis have not been substantiated. [558][,][559]

**7.5.6. Sulphonylureas**

Data on the effects of sulphonylureas on HF are inconsistent. Data
from two retrospective cohort studies, including 111 971 patients

∼
with diabetes, suggest an adverse safety profile showing 20–60% high-­
er death rate and ∼20–30% higher risk of HF compared with metfor-­
min. [560][,][561] However, in the UKPDS, NAVIGATOR (Nateglinide And
Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research), and
ADOPT trials, there were no increased HF signals. [127][,][562][–][564] In add-­
ition, data from the CAROLINA trial comparing linagliptin (shown to
not increase the risk of HF hospitalization vs. placebo in the
CARMELINA trial) vs. glimepiride did not show an elevated risk of
HF hospitalization by this sulphonylurea. [179]

**7.5.7. Thiazolidinediones**

Thiazolidinediones increased the risk of HF hospitalization in several
trials and are not recommended in patients with diabetes and symp-­
tomatic HF. [165][,][565][–][567]

**7.5.8. Special consideration: hypoglycaemia and risk**
**of heart failure hospitalization**

Although severe hypoglycaemic events were associated with higher HF
hospitalization in some but not all studies, there is no clear evidence for
causality. [139][,][140][,][554][,][568] Recent analyses have demonstrated bi-directional
associations between hypoglycaemia and CV outcomes, including HF,
suggesting that this is not causal, but rather reflects underlying frailty
and risk of adverse outcomes. [139][,][140]

#### **8. Arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, ** **ventricular arrhythmias, and ** **sudden cardiac death and diabetes**

Diabetes may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias via several fac-­
tors including: associated CV risk factors (e.g. hypertension), CVD
(i.e. CAD, prior MI, HF, or stroke), and diabetes-associated factors
such as glucose control or diabetic neuropathy. [157][,][569][–][572] The risk
of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients
with diabetes is most often related to the presence and severity of
underlying CVD, but diabetes-related factors may induce arrhyth-­
mias independently of CV comorbidities. [157][,][573][–][577] The risk of con-­
duction disturbances and need for pacemaker therapy may also be
higher in patients with T2DM than in controls, although the general
management for these issues should not differ from that for other
patients. [578][,][579]

**8.1. Atrial fibrillation and diabetes**
**8.1.1. Epidemiology of atrial fibrillation and its**
**association with diabetes**

Patients with T1DM or T2DM may exhibit atrial electrical and
structural remodelling associated with increased vulnerability for
AF. [580][–][583] Many epidemiological studies have reported an association
of diabetes (mainly T2DM) with incident AF. [584][,][585] Recent, large ana-­
lyses confirmed that T1DM was also independently associated with a
higher incidence of AF. [586][–][588] Diabetes duration has also been asso-­
ciated with AF; each year with diabetes conferred a 3% increase in
the risk of AF. [589] A meta-analysis of 11 studies with 108 703 AF cases
in 1 686 097 patients showed a 40% greater risk of AF in the presence
of diabetes. The effect was attenuated but still significant after adjusting
for other risk factors (RR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.06–1.44). [590] Although men
have higher absolute rates for incidence of AF, the relative rates of in-­
cident AF associated with diabetes are higher in women than in men for
both T1DM and T2DM. [586][–][588]

Diabetes and AF frequently co-exist, and when this occurs, there is a
substantially higher risk of all-cause death, CV death, stroke, kidney dis-­
ease, and HF, regardless of diabetes type. [541][,][577][,][591][–][596] Risk factors
commonly associated with diabetes and AF (and not fully dissociable,
e.g. hypertension and obesity) are also likely to worsen prognosis. In
several observational studies, the age-adjusted association of diabetes
with incident AF was no longer significant after multiple adjustments
for hypertension, CV comorbidity, BMI, or obesity, thus suggesting
that strategies for preventing AF in patients with diabetes should focus


on controlling diabetes-associated comorbidities (especially weight,
sleep apnoea, and BP). [597][–][600]

Intensive glucose lowering (target HbA1c <6.0%) has been asso-­
ciated with similar incident AF rates than a less-stringent approach
(HbA1c <8.0%). [601] The rate of new-onset AF may, however, be af-­
fected by diabetes therapy. [577] The impact of anti-hyperglycaemic
agents on the risk of AF is still debated. It has been suggested that met-­
formin and pioglitazone may reduce the risk of AF. [602] SGLT2 inhibitors,
compared with placebo, were associated with more new-onset AF
cases in EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin vs. placebo), but fewer
incident AF cases in CANVAS (canagliflozin vs. placebo) and
DECLARE-TIMI 58 (dapagliflozin vs. placebo). [71][,][151][,][153][,][603] In the
EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, compared with placebo,
reduced CV death or HF hospitalization consistently in patients with
diabetes with or without AF ( *P* int = 0.56). [604] It has recently been re-­
ported that finerenone may reduce new-onset AF in patients with
T2DM and CKD. [605] This is consistent with results obtained with other
MRAs in HF. [508][,][606]

In the ADVANCE study, patients with diabetes and AF (∼8%) had
higher risks of all-cause death, CV death, major cerebrovascular events,
and HF compared with patients with diabetes without AF. Lowering BP
resulted in similar RR reduction in all-cause and CV death but, due to
their higher risk of these events, the absolute benefits from BP control
was much greater in patients with AF. [607] In the VALUE (Valsartan
Antihypertensive Long-term Use Evaluation) trial, hypertensive pa-­
tients with new-onset diabetes had higher rates of new-onset AF com-­
pared with patients without diabetes, and were at a higher risk of HF. [608]

Hence, AF in patients with diabetes should be viewed as a marker of
adverse outcome, which should prompt aggressive management of all
concomitant risk factors. [609]

**8.1.2. Screening and managing atrial fibrillation in**
**patients with diabetes**
Detecting AF in patients with diabetes has clinical consequences be-­
cause the risk of stroke is markedly higher in these patients. In the ab-­
sence of other comorbidities, the annual risk of stroke can be
estimated at 2.2% per year in isolated diabetes. [610] Since asymptomatic
(silent) AF is not uncommon, patients with diabetes should be oppor-­
tunistically screened for AF by palpating pulse or by ECG. [611] Patients
with diabetes at high risk of AF would likely benefit from an active
screening for AF, but more data are needed to define optimal AF
screening strategies also including modern equipment, such as wear-­
[able digital devices in patients with diabetes (Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)
online, *[Table S16](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data)* ). [612][,][613] Before starting treatment, clinical AF should

be well documented using surface-lead ECG (≥30 s showing heart
rhythm with no discernible repeating P waves and irregular R–R inter-­
vals when atrioventricular conduction is not impaired;
*Figure 17* ). [600][,][614]

In patients with diabetes and established AF, controlling the ventricu-­
lar rate is recommended to decrease symptoms and prevent AF-related
complications, while asymptomatic patients mainly need thromboembolic prevention. In those with persistent symptoms despite ad-­
equate rate control, or in those with LV dysfunction attributable to
poorly controlled high ventricular rate, rhythm-control strategies
should be attempted, including cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drug use,
and catheter ablation, which is the general management in this setting
whether diabetes is present or not. [600][,][615][–][617] For details on managing
AF, please refer to the 2020 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the diagnosis
and management of atrial fibrillation and recent European Heart
Rhythm Association scientific documents. [577][,][600][,][613]

**8.1.3. Preventing stroke in patients with atrial**
**fibrillation and diabetes**
Stratifying AF stroke risk with diabetes should use the established
CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (Congestive HF, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years [2
points], Diabetes mellitus, Stroke/transient ischaemic attack [2 points],
Vascular disease, Age [65–74 years], Sex category [female]) score; fol-­
lowing stratification, stroke prevention (i.e. OAC) should be started in
patients with >1 risk factor. [600][,][618] The score is likely higher in patients

with diabetes due to the common association with other risk factors

for stroke, such as arterial hypertension, age over 65 or 75 years, asso-­
ciated vascular disease, or HF. Several studies found that diabetes inde-­
pendently predicted stroke in patients with AF. [619] However, diabetes
may not be a significant risk factor for stroke in the elderly. [620] The
Stroke in AF Working Group attributed a RR of 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4–
2.0) for stroke in patients with AF and diabetes, as well as an absolute
stroke risk of 2–3.5% per year for non-anticoagulated patients in the
same population. [621] Diabetes is probably not the most potent inde-­
pendent risk factor for stroke in AF compared with the other items
in the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score, but it is included in this risk-stratification
tool, giving a point alongside most other items. [600][,][618][,][622][–][624] The in-­
creased risk of stroke associated with AF and diabetes is similar in

T1DM and T2DM except perhaps a slightly increased risk in T2DM
compared with T1DM in patients <65 years of age. The risk of stroke
in patients with diabetes and AF may increase with longer diabetes dur-­
ation, increasing levels of HbA1c, and more diabetes-related comorbid-­
ities, such as nephropathy and retinopathy. [625][,][626]

As an OAC is being initiated, a clinical bleeding risk score, such as the
HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke,
Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile international normalized ra-­
tio, Elderly [>65 years], Drugs/alcohol concomitantly) score, should
be used to identify patients at risk of bleeding, and importantly, to ad-­
dress the potentially reversible bleeding risk factors (that should be
considered in all patients, irrespective of HAS-BLED score). [600] Due
to the increased risk of several CV adverse events in patients with dia-­
betes, a similar RR reduction with OACs generally translates into great-­
er ARR in the diabetes population. [577] The beneficial efficacy and safety
of NOACs compared with warfarin seem conserved in patients with
AF and diabetes, irrespective of their baseline stroke risk or the pres-­
ence of other CV risk factors. [577][,][627][–][629]

**8.2. Ventricular arrhythmias and risk of**
**sudden cardiac death and diabetes**

Compared with the general population, patients with diabetes have an
increased risk of both SCD and non-SCD. [575][,][615][,][644][–][646] In a

meta-analysis of 14 studies involving 346 356 participants and 5647
SCD cases, the risk of SCD was two-fold higher in patients with dia-­
betes compared with patients without diabetes (adjusted HR 2.25;
95% CI, 1.70–2.97). [647] However, patients with diabetes also exhibited
a nearly three-fold greater risk of non-SCD than patients without

diabetes (adjusted HR 2.90; 95% CI, 1.89–4.46). [646] Men at all ages have
a higher risk of SCD than women, but in the presence of diabetes, the
risk of SCD is higher in both men and women. [575][,][615][,][644][–][646][,][648]

Both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia are independently asso-­
ciated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. [649]

Insulin-induced hypoglycaemia has been associated with nocturnal
death (also called ‘dead-in-bed syndrome’) in T1DM, and arrhythmic
deaths were reported in several T2DM trials. [187][,][576][,][650][–][654] Diabetic kid-­
ney disease might also play a role in the arrhythmia-associated mechan-­
ism of sudden death in this setting. [655]

Hypoglycaemia-associated arrhythmias are difficult to document, but
observational studies using CGM and Holter monitoring in small T2DM
cohorts showed that hypoglycaemic episodes were common, often
asymptomatic, and associated with various arrhythmias. [656][,][657]

Compared with daytime hypoglycaemia, nocturnal episodes were
more common and associated with a greater risk of bradycardia or at-­
rial ectopy, while ventricular arrhythmias were equally common. [656][,][657]

The use of antiarrhythmic drugs should follow the general principles
and precautions related to pharmacological treatment of cardiac ar-­
rhythmias. [600][,][658] In patients with diabetes and an ICD, there is an in-­
creased risk of death in those who have appropriate therapy
compared to those who do not. [659] In contrast, patients with diabetes
may have a lower risk of inappropriate therapy or ICD shock, since
they may be more sedentary with consequently less frequent
exercise-induced sinus tachycardia and also lower incidence of lead
fracture. [600][,][658][,][659]

Observational studies have reported significant corrected QT (QTc)
interval prolongation possibly associated with microvascular complica-­
tions, atypical patterns of microvolt T-wave alternans, altered heart
rate variability, or heart rate turbulence in patients with diabetes, but
none of these tests should routinely be used to stratify the risk of ven-­
tricular arrhythmias or SCD in clinical practice. [658][,][660][–][668] There may
also be a direct effect of both hyper- and hypoglycaemia on QTc inter-­
val. [669][–][671] The mechanisms by which hyperglycaemia may produce ven-­
tricular instability may be increased sympathetic activity, increased
cytosolic calcium content in myocytes, or both. [672] The risk of cardiac
events is usually related to the underlying heart disease rather than ven-­
tricular premature beats. [669][–][671]

There is no diabetes-specific protocol for SCD screening, but all pa-­
tients diagnosed with diabetes should undergo regular evaluation for
CV risk factors or structural heart disease. [48][,][576][,][658] Patients with dia-­
betes and symptoms suggestive of cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. palpitations,
pre-syncope, or syncope) should undergo further detailed diagnostic
assessment. [576] Patients with diabetes and frequent premature ventricu-­
lar beats, episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, or symp-­
toms suggestive of HF should be examined for the presence of an
underlying structural heart disease and their eligibility for an ICD should
be assessed; this is a general principle in managing patients with HF, ir-­
respective of diabetes status. [658] In case of sustained ventricular arrhyth-­
mias, diagnosing underlying structural heart disease with imaging
techniques and coronary angiography is usually needed if no obvious
trigger factors, such as electrolyte imbalance, can be identified. [48][,][576][,][658]

Although cardiac arrhythmias were not specifically investigated in ei-­
ther the LEADER or the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trials, an antiarrhyth-­
mic effect of these drugs (perhaps mediated by glucagon-release
stimulation or increased blood ketone bodies, which may have
sympathico-suppressive effects) has been hypothesized to contribute
to the reduced risk of CV death. [71][,][72] In the DAPA-HF trial, dapagliflozin
reduced the risk of the composite outcome of serious ventricular ar-­
rhythmia, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or sudden death by 21% in


patients with HFrEF, compared with placebo. [673] The benefit was mainly
observed >9 months post-randomization, suggesting that the beneficial
effects of dapagliflozin require time to develop and may involve cellular
mechanisms that slow the progression of HFrEF. [674] However, a recent
meta-analysis indicated that SGLT2 inhibition was not associated with
an overall lower risk of SCD or ventricular arrhythmias in patients
with T2DM and/or HF and/or CKD, although the point estimates sug-­
gested potential benefits. [675]
#### **9. Chronic kidney disease and ** **diabetes**

**9.1. Chronic kidney disease definitions,**
**staging, and screening**
Chronic kidney disease has a major effect on global morbidity and mor-­
tality. [676] CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or func-­
tion, present for >3 months, with implications for health. It is staged
primarily by categories of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albumin-­
uria. [677] The CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) has devel-­
oped accurate eGFR equations based on creatinine ± cystatin C
measurements. [678] An eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ] does not constitute

CKD unless there is albuminuria or other evidence of kidney disease
( *Table 11* ). [677] A persistent decrease in eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ]

(i.e. stages G3–5), however, is sufficient to confirm CKD. This level
of eGFR is associated with increased risk of CKD progression and
CVD. [43][,][679][,][680] The most advanced stage of CKD is characterized by
an eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m [2], and recently implemented nomencla-­
ture refers to this as ‘kidney failure’. [681] Such low levels of eGFR may

necessitate the need to start maintenance kidney replacement therapy
(KRT). [677]

Albuminuria is an early marker of nephropathy and predicts both risk
of kidney failure and CVD independently of eGFR. [43][,][682] Nephropathy
caused by diabetes is a leading cause of CKD globally, and screening pa-­
tients with diabetes for CKD is recommended at least annually. [676][,][677] A
spot urine sample measuring UACR is an efficient method to identify
and quantify albuminuria. [677][,][683] Changes in UACR or GFR slope are
used as surrogate trial endpoints for nephroprotection, but more de-­
finitive evidence for reducing risk of kidney failure in patients with dia-­
betes generally requires categorical endpoints based on a ≥40%
sustained decline in GFR. [684][,][685]

**9.2. Management of cardiovascular disease**
**risk and kidney failure in patients with**
**chronic kidney disease and diabetes**
Risk of CVD increases progressively with lower levels of eGFR and, in
those with advanced CKD, structural abnormalities of the heart, HF,
and sudden death are particular features. [679][,][680][,][686][–][688] Increased risk
of CAD also accompanies CKD, often with calcification of atheroscler-­
otic plaques. [679][,][689] Accelerated vascular media calcification with in-­
creased vascular stiffness is also a feature of CKD and attributed to

disordered calcium–phosphate metabolism, referred to as
CKD-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). [690][,][691] Managing CVD risk
in patients with CKD and diabetes may, therefore, need to consider mul-­
tiple interventions and both traditional and CKD-specific risk fac-­
tors. [361][,][692][–][694]

All patients with diabetes and CKD should be offered standard ad-­
vice on smoking, nutrition, and exercise. [45] A raised BMI is independent-­
ly associated with risk of CKD, and behavioural interventions to
promote weight loss in people with T2DM reduce the risk of develop-­
ing very high-risk CKD over the long-term. [57][,][695][,][696] Management of
people with diabetes and CKD is then based on sequentially initiating
and titrating doses of pharmacological interventions with proven effi-­
cacy ( *Figure 18* ).

Statin-based therapy reduces the risk of major atherosclerotic events
(i.e. coronary death, non-fatal MI, ischaemic stroke, and coronary revascu-­
larization) in patients with CKD, but does not meaningfully slow progres-­
sion of CKD. [248][,][697][–][699] Trials of statin-based therapy, combined in
collaborative meta-analyses, show a trend towards smaller relative reduc-­
tions per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C on major atherosclerotic events as
eGFR declines, with uncertainty about benefits among patients on dialy-­
sis. [697] This diminution in RR reduction at decreased eGFR implies that
more intensive LDL-C-lowering regimens are required to maximize ben-­
efits. [697] The goal in patients with CKD and diabetes should be to achieve
the largest possible absolute reduction in LDL-C safely. [697][,][700]

Four large trials recruiting different types of patients with CKD have
confirmed the safety of intensive LDL-C lowering with statins alone
(atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin), or combining a moderate dose
of simvastatin with ezetimibe. [698][,][701][–][704] Although there is no dedicated,
large-scale trial of a PCSK9 inhibitor in patients with CKD, sub-group
analyses by CKD stage from the FOURIER trial of the PCSK9 inhibitor
evolocumab found its LDL-C-lowering effect was preserved in patients
with stage G3 CKD, and CV benefits on atherosclerotic events ap-­
peared unmodified by baseline eGFR. [699]

Several drugs developed to manage CVD risk or hyperglycaemia
have been shown to reduce the risk of CKD progression in large trials
that recruited patients with T2DM and CKD ( *Figure 18* ). These in-­
clude RAS inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and finerenone. There is


increasing evidence that these interventions should be started early
to prevent end-organ damage in at-risk patients.

Blocking RAS with an ACE-I (captopril) or ARBs (irbesartan/losar-­
tan) prevented kidney failure in patients with diabetes and overt ne-­
phropathy in dedicated clinical outcomes trials. [705][–][707] ARBs
(irbesartan/telmisartan) also slowed progression from microalbumi-­
nuria (albuminuria stage A2) to overt nephropathy. [708][,][709] These
RAS inhibitors are therefore recommended in patients with diabetes
as soon as CKD is clinically diagnosed. Combining an ARB with an
ACE-I, however, is not recommended, as large trials have identified
an increased risk of hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury, without
demonstrable additional benefits of such ‘dual-blockade’ on risk of
kidney failure or CVD. [710]

In contrast, combining an SGLT2 inhibitor with an ACE-I or ARB has
clear beneficial effects on risk of kidney failure and hospitalization for HF
in patients with CKD and T2DM. [153][,][542] The CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD,
and EMPA-KIDNEY placebo-controlled trials were all stopped early for
efficacy while testing canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin, re-­
spectively. [153][,][543][,][711] All three trials found the RR reductions for kidney
disease progression were unmodified by baseline eGFR, with
EMPA-KIDNEY reporting clear benefits in patients with eGFR 20–
30 mL/min/1.73 m [2] . [153][,][542][,][543][,][712][,][713] EMPA-KIDNEY included 254 pa-­
tients with an eGFR <20 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ] at randomization, and once in-­
itiated, SGLT2 inhibitors could be continued until the need of KRT. As

patients with decreased eGFR are at the highest absolute risk of kidney
disease progression, these trials’ results should encourage the initiation
of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with CKD down to at least an eGFR of
20 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ] with continued use until the need for KRT (despite
low eGFR substantially attenuating their HbA1c-lowering effect).
Meta-analysis of all the large SGLT2 inhibitor trials shows benefits of
SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of HF hospitalization or CV death are
also unmodified by eGFR (at a trial level; *Figure 19* ). [714] The combined
SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin was analysed vs. placebo in the
SCORED trial in patients with T2DM and CKD (eGFR 25–60 mL/min/
1.73 m [2] ); sotagliflozin reduced the primary composite of the total num-­
ber of CV deaths, hospitalizations for HF, and urgent visits for HF by 26%
vs. placebo (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63–0.88; *P* < 0.001). [150] Initiating an
SGLT2 inhibitor alongside an ACE-I or ARB is therefore recommended
in patients with T2DM following the first clinical evidence of CKD. In pa-­
tients with T1DM and CKD, the absence of large trials with sufficient
follow-up means it is unclear whether the absolute benefits of SGLT2
inhibitors on kidney failure and CVD outcomes are outweighed by the
high absolute risk of ketoacidosis with SGLT2 inhibitors. [715][,][716]

MRAs reduce BP and albuminuria in patients with CKD. [717] The
placebo-controlled FIDELIO-DKD (Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone
in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetic Kidney
Disease) and FIGARO-DKD (Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone in
Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the Clinical Diagnosis of
Diabetic Kidney Disease) trials demonstrated for the non-steroidal
MRA finerenone that these effects translate into reduced risk of kidney
failure and a reduction of the combined CV outcome of CV death, non
fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF in patients with CKD
and T2DM who are already on maximum ACE-I or ARB. [718][–][720]

FIDELIO-DKD demonstrated reduced risk of a categorical kidney out-­
come, a primary composite outcome combining kidney failure, a sus-­
tained decline in eGFR of at least 40%, or death from renal causes, in
patients with eGFR 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ] and UACR of 34–
567 mg/mmol (30–5000 mg/g), or eGFR 60–75 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ] with
UACR of 34–567 mg/mmol (300–5000 mg/g; mean eGFR 43 ±
13 mL/min/1.73 m [2] ; median UACR 96 mg/mmol [852 mg/g]). [719]

UACR ≥3 mg/mmol (30 mg/g); stage A2 and A3]. [b] Canagliflozin, empagliflozin, or dapagliflozin.


Information on the safety and efficacy of combining MRAs with
SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD is limited as only ∼4% of FIDELIO-DKD,
∼8% of FIGARO-DKD, ∼5% of DAPA-CKD, and no CREDENCE par-­
ticipants were prescribed such a combination. [153][,][718][,][719][,][721] Sub-group
analyses considering those co-prescribed MRA and SGLT2 inhibitors
suggest their combined use does not modify safety findings from the
key trials. [150][,][189][,][722][–][726]


FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD excluded patients with a potas-­
sium of >4.8 mmol/L, as MRAs cause hyperkalaemia. [718][,][719]

Combining RAS and SGLT2 inhibitors does not appear to cause hyper-­
kalaemia, and a hypothesis has been raised that SGLT2 inhibitors re-­
duce the risk of severe hyperkalaemia among MRA users with
HF. [153][,][542][,][710][,][723][,][724][,][727][,][728] Finerenone is therefore recommended in

addition to an RAS inhibitor in patients with T2DM and eGFR

with appropriate potassium monitoring. [718][,][719]

**9.3. Blood pressure and glycaemic control**
**in patients with diabetes and chronic**
**kidney disease**
In patients with T2DM, BP lowering reduces CV risk, with relative ben-­
efits similar in people with and without CKD. [196][,][693][,][729] RR reductions
for CVD per 10 mmHg of lower SBP are greater in patients with a start-­
ing SBP of ≥140 mmHg, but a reduced risk of stroke and albuminuria is

evident with a further reduction in SBP in those with an SBP
<140 mmHg. [196] Whether intensively lowering moderately elevated
SBP prevents kidney failure, however, is uncertain.

The effect of tight glycaemic control, as compared with standard con-­
trol, on risk of kidney failure is also uncertain, but such an approach reduces
risk of developing or worsening of diabetic nephropathy based on mea-­
sures of albuminuria. [132][,][133][,][730] Personalized HbA1c targets of 6.5−8.0%

−
(48 64 mmol/mol) are suggested for people with diabetes and CKD,
with a target <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) still recommended to reduce micro-­
vascular complications, wherever possible. [132][,][133] Above eGFR 30 mL/min/
1.73 m [2], metformin with appropriate dose adjustment can be used, but
below eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m [2], metformin should generally be stopped
to avoid risk of lactic acidosis due to its accumulation. [731][,][732]

In CKD, HbA1c monitoring may be less reliable when eGFR is
<30 mL/min/1.73 m [2], and self-monitoring or CGM may help safely
achieve tight glycaemic control in such patients. [45]

Another potential strategy to help achieve glycaemic targets in pa-­
tients with CKD is use of GLP-1 RAs. Extrapolating evidence from
trials in patients with T2DM suggest GLP-1 RAs safely improve gly-­
caemic control and may reduce weight and CV risk in patients with
CKD. [164] Meta-analysis of the GLP-1 RAs trials (lixisenatide, liraglutide,
semaglutide, exenatide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, efpeglenatide) showed
they favourably lower levels of albuminuria in T2DM, with some
GLP-1 RAs reducing MACE in those with prior CVD or at high CV
risk. [164] The size of RR reductions on MACE appears similar in people
with or without reduced eGFR. [164] Dulaglutide has been tested in pa-­
tients with T2DM and CKD stages G3–4. It was as effective at lower-­
ing HbA1c as insulin glargine, but it reduced weight, had lower rates of
symptomatic hypoglycaemia, and slowed eGFR decline compared
with insulin glargine. [733] The benefits of GLP-1 RAs on risk of kidney
failure have yet to be confirmed, and a definitive assessment of sema-­
glutide in the FLOW (Effect of Semaglutide Versus Placebo on the
Progression of Renal Impairment in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes
and Chronic Kidney Disease) trial of 3535 patients with T2DM and
albuminuric CKD is ongoing. [734]

An alternative to GLP-1 RAs in CKD is a DPP-4 inhibitor. Linagliptin
safely lowers HbA1c in patients with T2DM and CKD but does not re-­
duce risk of CVD or kidney failure. [180]

**9.4. Roles for antithrombotic therapy and**
**invasive strategies in managing**
**atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in**

**patients with diabetes and chronic kidney**
**disease**

Low-dose ASA (75–100 mg o.d.) is indicated in patients with diabetes and/
or CKD and ASCVD. [325] In primary ASCVD prevention in T2DM and
CKD, the benefits and risks of low-dose ASA may be finely


counterbalanced. [291][,][292][,][325][,][735] CKD is associated with both increased

ASCVD and bleeding risk, and so the net effects of low-dose ASA
(75 mg o.d.) in CKD (stages G3–G4 or G1–2 with albuminuria) without
ASCVD is being tested in the large, open-label, ATTACK (Aspirin to
Target Arterial Events in Chronic Kidney Disease) trial. [679][,][736][,][737] The net
benefit of low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg b.i.d.) on atherothrombotic vs.
bleeding risk is also being tested in the large, placebo-controlled,
TRACK (Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease with Low Dose
Rivaroxaban in Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease) trial in people with
CKD stage G4–5 who are at high CVD risk due to diabetes, age >65 years,
or prior ASCVD. [738]

Invasive vs. medical management strategies for stable moderate or se-­
vere CAD in CKD have been assessed in the ISCHEMIA-CKD

(International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical
and Invasive Approaches–Chronic Kidney Disease) trial, in which 57%
(444/777) of participants had diabetes. [739] The trial was conducted in
parallel with the large ISCHEMIA trial. [740] When results from both these
trials are considered alongside one another, ISCHEMIA-CKD suggests
that an initial conservative approach using intensive medical therapies
to manage stable CAD is appropriate for patients with diabetes and
an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m [2] . [739] ISCHEMIA-CKD did not replicate
the anti-anginal benefits of an invasive strategy observed in
ISCHEMIA, but such benefits should not be ruled out due to lower
power. [739][,][740] It should also be noted that patients with acute MI, un-­
stable CAD, or unacceptable levels of angina were excluded from
both trials, meaning optimal management of such conditions in patients
with CKD may still include an intensive strategy ( *Section 6* ).

Serum phosphate may increase in advanced CKD (e.g. eGFR <30 mL/
min/1.73 m [2] ) and is associated with an increased risk of CVD. [694] Lowering
phosphate, controlling parathyroid hormone, and maintaining normal cal-­
cium levels is common practice in nephrology despite a lack of definitive
evidence that it modifies risk of CVD. [691][,][741] Some evidence suggests the
dose of calcium-based phosphate binders should be restricted. [742][,][743] In pa-­
tients with T2DM and CKD, correcting renal anaemia improves quality of
life, but does not reduce the risk of CVD and may increase the risk of
stroke. [744] Renal specialist advice should be sought for managing a raised
serum phosphate (>1.5 mmol/L) or other evidence of CKD-MBD, and re-­
nal anaemia (e.g. haemoglobin <10 g/dL).

#### **10. Aortic and peripheral arterial ** **diseases and diabetes**

**10.1. The impact of diabetes on peripheral**
**atherosclerosis**

Diabetes is one of the most important risk factors for the develop-­
ment and progression of atherosclerosis. [747][–][751] The number of pa-­
tients with atherosclerosis associated with diabetes is steadily
increasing alongside the increasing number of patients with diabetes
worldwide. Peripheral atherosclerosis summarizes LEAD and carotid

atherosclerosis.

**10.1.1. Diabetes and lower-extremity artery disease**
The impact of diabetes differs between vascular territories. [747] The strong
correlation between LEAD and diabetes is well established. [747][–][749] Up to
30% of all patients with intermittent claudication and ∼50–70% of


patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (CLTI) have dia-­
betes. [750][,][752] Patients with diabetes and LEAD show specific anatomic
and morphologic characteristics, which are important for further man-­
agement. [753] In addition, patients with diabetes have occlusions of arteries
below the knee more often than do patients without diabetes. Moreover,
severe calcification, such as media sclerosis and development of collateral
circulation, is typical for these patients. [753]

Compared with patients without diabetes, those with diabetes de-­
velop LEAD at a younger age and have faster LEAD progression,
with more patients having CLTI. Prolonged diabetes duration, suboptimal glycaemic control, co-existing CV risk factors, and other
end-organ damage (e.g. proteinuria) increase the prevalence of
LEAD. [751] Moreover, patients with microangiopathy are at increased
risk of CLTI and major amputation. [754][,][755] In a cohort study with 125
674 participants, the presence of microvascular disease such as retinop-­
athy, nephropathy, or neuropathy independently increased the risk of
amputation. [754]

For patients with a diabetic foot ulcer (diabetic foot disease), the
risk of death at 5 years is 2.5 times higher than for patients with dia-­
betes but no foot ulcer. [752][,][756] In patients with diabetes, pain is often
masked because of peripheral neuropathy with decreased pain sensi-­
tivity. Therefore, atherosclerosis is often advanced when diagnosed.
CLTI is the clinical presentation of advanced disease, characterized
by ischaemic rest pain; however, pain may be absent in patients
with diabetes. The 2017 ESC Guidelines on the diagnosis and treat-­
ment of peripheral arterial diseases and the 2019 Global Vascular
Guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischaemia
proposed the Wound, Ischaemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) classifica-­
tion to stratify amputation risk and the potential benefits of revascu-­
[larization (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad192#supplementary-data) *Table S17* ). [747][,][757][,][758] Patients
with diabetes and critical limb ischaemia are at very high risk of lowerlimb amputation and recurrent wounds. All of these factors increase

the risk of limb infection.

Although 20–30% of patients with diabetes have LEAD, more than
half of these have no clinical symptoms. [760] Therefore, screening and
early diagnosis is important to allow early treatment and prevent major
amputation. Clinical evaluation includes medical history, assessing
symptoms, palpating peripheral pulses, and evaluating skin colour and
temperature. In addition, examination for neuropathy is important;
however, the sensitivity of clinical examination is limited. [761]

Therefore, screening for LEAD is indicated in patients with diabetes
and foot ulceration. [747][,][761] There is a lack of evidence concerning the
frequency of screening for LEAD in patients with diabetes, but it seems
plausible to assess leg perfusion regularly.

An ankle–brachial index (ABI) ≤0.90 is diagnostic for LEAD, with
80% sensitivity and 95% specificity in all populations. [760][,][762] However,
the accuracy of ABI is lower in patients with diabetes. [762][,][763] Beyond
LEAD, an ABI ≤0.90 (or >1.40) is associated with an increased risk
of death and CV events. [762][,][763] Measuring ABI can be difficult due to
medial calcinosis (ABI >1.40), in which case, other tests are useful for
diagnosing LEAD, including Doppler waveform analysis of the ankle ar-­
teries, or the toe–brachial index (TBI), which may be helpful because
medial calcinosis barely affects digital arteries. A TBI <0.70 is diagnostic
for LEAD. [747][,][763]

In patients with intermittent claudication, a treadmill test is useful for
assessing walking distance. [747] Duplex scan is the first-line imaging for
confirming LEAD and should be performed at least when revasculariza-­
tion is indicated. Magnetic resonance angiography or CT angiography
can also help to plan further treatment ( *Figure 20* ).

**4106** ESC Guidelines


Due to the high burden of comorbidities in patients with diabetes,
interdisciplinary co-operation is crucial. The medical management of
LEAD in patients with diabetes does not differ from that recommended
for patients with ASCVD in general including SGLT2 inhibitors and
GLP-1 RAs. [747][,][757][,][764][,][765] Still, it should be noted that for the SGLT2 in-­
hibitor canagliflozin, the risk of amputation was increased in the
CANVAS study, a finding that has not been repeated in the
CREDENCE trial comparing canagliflozin with placebo in patients
with T2DM and CKD, nor in CVOTs with other SGLT2 inhibitors. [151]

Still, according to US Food and Drug Administration requirements,
the amputation risk with canagliflozin is described in the Warnings
and Precautions section of the prescribing information. There are
some discussions as to whether the use of GLP-1 RAs could be prefer-­
able in patients with LEAD. Ongoing studies may help to clarify this
question in the future.

Recent data showed that the combination of low-dose ASA and riv-­
aroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. reduces MACE and major adverse limb events
including amputation (MALE) compared with ASA and placebo, par-­
ticularly in patients with PAD. [766] A sub-group analysis of patients
with LEAD showed a significantly higher MACE and MALE rate com-­
pared with patients with CAD and a higher benefit of the combination
therapy. [767] Improvement of prognosis was similar in patients with
(44%) and without diabetes. The total number of major bleeding events
was increased but fatal or critical organ bleeding did not.

Patients with intermittent claudication should take part in exercise
training programmes (30–45 min, at least three times per week), as
regular intensive exercise improves walking distance. [747]

In patients with CLTI, revascularization must be attempted when pos-­
sible, and amputation should only be considered when revascularization
options fail. [768] With respect to the revascularization modality of choice,
we refer to dedicated guidelines. There has not been a specific trial on
revascularization strategies in patients with diabetes; however, a review
of 56 studies including patients with diabetes suggested higher limbsalvage rates after revascularization (78–85% at 1 year) compared with
conservative management. [768] Due to disease progression, long-term
follow-up is very important in patients with diabetes and LEAD. [769]

**10.1.2. Diabetes and carotid artery disease**
According to the results of a recent community-based study, the preva-­
lence of diabetes linearly correlated with carotid plaques, and patients
with diabetes had more advanced carotid atherosclerosis than indivi-­
duals without diabetes. [770] Based on a prospective cohort study with
300 patients, which showed a high prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis
especially in men, screening of male patients with diabetes and a history
of CAD or ABI <0.85 has been suggested. [771] Nevertheless, in patients
with diabetes without a history of cerebrovascular disease, there is only
limited evidence that carotid screening improves outcomes, and regular
screening is not recommended. [747][,][772] Asymptomatic carotid artery dis-­
ease is frequently treated conservatively, and the patient is followed up
with duplex ultrasound.

Carotid revascularization should be considered in asymptomatic pa-­
tients with one or more indicators of increased stroke risk (previous
transient ischaemic attack/stroke, ipsilateral silent infarction, stenosis
progression, or high-risk plaques), and if the estimated peri-operative
stroke or death rate is <3% and the patient’s life expectancy is >5 years.
In symptomatic patients, carotid revascularization is indicated if the
stenosis is >70%, and should be considered if the stenosis is >50%, as-­
suming that the estimated peri-operative stroke or death rate is
<6%. [747]


With respect to the impact of diabetes on carotid revascularization, a
meta-analysis of 14 observational studies involving 16 264 patients
showed that patients with diabetes had a higher risk of peri-operative
stroke and death versus those without diabetes. [773] The CREST

(Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting) trial was
the only trial comparing carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery
stenting to enrol enough patients with diabetes ( *n* = 759) for sub-group
analysis. [774] Although re-stenosis rates were low at 2 years after carotid
stenting (6.0%) and carotid endarterectomy (6.3%), diabetes predicted
re-stenosis with both techniques.

Details on revascularization strategies can be found in the 2017 ESC
Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial diseases. [747]

**10.2. Diabetes and aortic aneurysm**
Current evidence shows a lower risk of developing aortic aneurysm in
patients with diabetes compared with persons without dia-­
betes. [759][,][775][,][776] There are different mechanisms under discussion includ-­
ing effects on extracellular matrix volume, extracellular matrix glycation,
the formation of advanced glycation end-products, inflammation, oxida-­
tive stress, and intraluminal thrombus biology. [777] Moreover, some med-­
ications, such as metformin used to treat diabetes, seem to have
protective effects on the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms.

Nevertheless, aortic aneurysm is associated with atherosclerosis and
general secondary prevention is recommended based on expert

consensus.

#### **11. Type 1 diabetes and ** **cardiovascular disease**

This section summarizes evidence-based recommendations to effect-­
ively manage CV risk factors in patients with T1DM; the section does
not address the control of glucose levels, which must follow the prin-­
ciples of patient self-management under the guidance of the diabetes
healthcare multidisciplinary team according to clinical recommenda-­
tions by EASD/ADA. [1]

People with T1DM face a three-fold increase in mortality compared
with the general population, which translates into an 11-year reduction
in life expectancy; CVD mortality accounts for 30–44% of all deaths in
patients with T1DM. [780][–][784]

The DCCT prospectively investigated not only the impact of an in-­
tensified glucose-lowering treatment strategy on microvascular compli-­
cations in patients with T1DM, but also the rate of macrovascular
events at long-term follow-up. This study showed that intensified insu-­
lin therapy lasting over a mean of 6.5 years halved the incidence and
progression of microvascular sequelae, which was associated with a sig-­
nificant decrease in HbA1c, compared with conventional therapy. [126]

After a mean follow-up of 17 years in >90% of the initially enrolled pa-­
tients, CV risk was also significantly reduced by 42% in the intensifiedtreatment group, and the reduction in HbA1c over the first 6.5 years
was significantly associated with a reduction in CV risk. [785] In the
EDIC (Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications)
study, patients were followed up for over 30 years and the following
was concluded: (i) hyperglycaemia is the primary modifiable mediator
of late complications in T1DM; (ii) near-normal glucose control reduces
the incidence and progression of microvascular complications, such as
retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy; and (iii) intensive diabetes
therapy reduces CV complications in T1DM. [786]


Recently, a mediation analysis and multi-variable models of the EDIC
trial showed that the quality of adjustment of traditional risk factors ac-­
counts for only ∼50% of the cardio-protective effect of improved
metabolic control. [787] About 40% of the cardio-protective effect re-­
mains for HbA1c or elevated glucose concentrations per se.
Accordingly, recent analyses from the Swedish National Diabetes
Register evaluated the prognostic significance of 17 risk factors for
death, acute MI, or stroke. Of the 32 611 patients with T1DM in this
Swedish registry cohort, 5.5% died over the course of 10.4 years.
The strongest predictors of death and CV endpoints were HbA1c, al-­
buminuria, diabetes duration, systolic BP, and LDL-C concentration. [788]

Thus, reducing CV risk in patients with T1DM relates to both low-­
ering HbA1c and controlling other classical CV risk factors, including
BP and LDL-C. Therefore, glucose control target values are recom-­
mended for most adults with T1DM by the joint consensus report of
the ADA and EASD: HbA1c <53 mmol/mol or <7.0%; pre-prandial glu-­
cose 4.4–7.2 mmol/L or 80–130 mg/dL; and 1–2 h post-prandial glu-­
cose <10.0 mmol/L or <180 mg/dL. [13] Hypoglycaemia should be
avoided, especially in patients with CV complications.

Advances in diabetes technologies have started a new era in clinical
practice, and the use of CGM has now become widespread. CGM can
significantly improve glycaemic control in T1DM, providing more de-­
tailed information and introducing new outcome variables including
time-in-range and glycaemic variability. [138]

Management strategies should adapt new therapies and technologies
as they become available, according to the wishes and desires of the
person with diabetes.

**11.1. Cardiovascular risk assessment in**

**type 1 diabetes**
With respect to treatment targets and thresholds for other CV risk fac-­
tors, a critical question is predicting CV risk in patients with T1DM
without CVD. Determining ASCVD risk in patients with T1DM is
less well studied than in patients with T2DM.

In 2011, an observational study using the data from 3661 patients in the
Swedish National Diabetes Register proposed a 5-year CVD risk model for
use in patients with T1DM. [789] More recently, the Steno Type 1 Risk Engine
was externally validated at 5 years but lacks validation at 10 years. [790] Age at
the onset and duration of diabetes are two risk factors that lead the estima-­
tion of CV risk. Thus, patients diagnosed with T1DM at an early age show an
increased incidence of CVD. In addition, excess mortality in patients diag-­
nosed with T1DM under the age of 10 years, compared with those aged
26–30 years at diagnosis, has been highlighted by a Swedish study. [791]

This concept has been underlined by the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of
Diabetes Complications (EDC) study, which showed duration of diabetes
to be an independent risk factor for MACE. [791][,][792] Several other risk factors
related to diabetes management, including glycaemic control, insulin re-­
quirements, smoking, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, dysfunctional im-­
mune response, and insulin resistance, are to be taken into account. [788]

A recent risk tool, developed based on the Scottish/Swedish
Diabetes Registry and validated in the Swedish National Diabetes
Register can provide individualized risk predictions. [793] This 10-year
[ASCVD risk prediction tool https://diabepi.shinyapps.io/cvdrisk/ could](https://diabepi.shinyapps.io/cvdrisk/)
facilitate risk estimation and discussions with patients with T1DM.

**11.2. Managing cardiovascular risk**
Analogies of recommendations for risk-factor modifications in patients
with T1DM derive from the fact that there is no direct evidence that

CV risk reduction by lowering causal CV risk factors, like LDL-C or

**4108** ESC Guidelines


BP, differs in patients with T1DM or T2DM. However, the recommen-­
dations are given in the awareness that, in most CVOTs for lipids, BP,
antiplatelet agents, and anticoagulation, patients with T1DM were ex-­
cluded or recruited in small groups. In the following, we summarize re-­
commendations of the respective sections with focus on specific
aspects or caveats that should be considered in patients with T1DM. [794]

**11.2.1. Exercise and lifestyle**
Data on the effects of exercise on T1DM are inconclusive. Aerobic fit-­
ness improved HbA1c in patients with T1DM, but did not affect BMI,
BP, and lipids. [795]

**11.2.2. Lipid lowering**

Statins remain the cornerstone of lipid-lowering treatment. In patients
with T1DM at a younger age, starting statins early might be justified
with long duration of disease, two additional risk factors, or microalbu-­
minuria. In the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration
meta-analysis, 1466 patients with T1DM were also included. [248]

Increased cholesterol absorption in T1DM compared with T2DM
may explain why ezetimibe, a drug that directly decreases cholesterol
absorption, may reduce LDL-C more in T1DM than in T2DM. [796][,][797]

**11.2.3. Blood pressure**
People with T1DM may benefit from stringent BP-lowering strategies.
A recent analysis of the EDC study in patients without known CAD
showed that the optimal BP threshold associated with reduced CVD
risk was 120/80 mmHg in young adults with childhood-onset
T1DM. [798] Routine ambulatory BP monitoring is recommended to iden-­
tify subjects with masked hypertension, as demonstrated in a Finnish
study in which one-quarter of patients with T1DM had underlying
hypertension and increased arterial stiffness. [799]

**11.2.4. Antiplatelet therapy**
Antiplatelet agents may be beneficial in individuals with T1DM without
symptomatic ASCVD who have at least one additional major CV risk
factor. [800]

**11.3. Glucose-lowering agents beyond**
**insulin**

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors are cur-­
rently not indicated for T1DM.

Although GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors reduce CV risk in patients
with T2DM in large CVOTs, no such data are available for patients with
T1DM. For GLP-1 RAs, despite showing potential in reducing HbA1c
and weight in patients with T1DM in the ADJUNCT ONE (The Efficacy
and Safety of Liraglutide as Adjunct Therapy to Insulin in the Treatment
of Type 1 Diabetes) Treat-To-Target trial, concerns have been raised
about increased rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia
with ketosis. [801] Another RCT in patients with T1DM also showed no sig-­
nificant overall reduction in HbA1c by liraglutide compared with pla-­
cebo. [802] Adding SGLT2 inhibitors at a lower than usual dose to insulin
therapy in T1DM may reduce glucose variability and facilitate glucose con-­
trol, thereby reducing insulin doses and hypoglycaemia. [803] However, ke-­
toacidosis at lower glucose levels, so called ‘euglycaemic ketoacidosis’,
has been reported in 2–3% of patients with T1DM taking SGLT2 inhibi-­
tors. [804] This is a potentially lethal complication.


**11.4. Renal protection in type 1 diabetes**
As in patients with T2DM, patients with T1DM should be regularly
screened for kidney disease by assessing eGFR defined by CKD-EPI
and UACR. [677] RAS blockade with an ACE-I prevents kidney failure in
patients with T1DM and overt nephropathy ( *Section 9* ). [705][,][805] RAS in-­
hibitors are therefore recommended in patients with T1DM as soon as
kidney damage is first clinically evident.

#### **12. Person-centred care**

A person-centred approach that encourages and empowers patients to
actively take part in finding solutions to their problems is suggested. [806]

Person-centred care, including shared decision-making, goes beyond
maintaining active person consent to decisions and the person’s partici-­
pation to the development of the therapeutic plan. It shapes disease
management to advance the life and health-related quality of life of
the person. [806][,][807] It helps people make better healthcare decisions
based on their informed preferences in collaboration with their health-­
care professionals (HCPs). [806] Person-centred care requires:

- Identifying and integrating patient needs, background, and culture
into decisions regarding health practices. [808][–][812]

- Active person participation as a key factor for successful selfmanagement. [808] This encompasses all kinds of preferences, as well
as physical, psychosocial, behavioural, and financial needs in the devel-­
opment of the therapeutic plan. [808][,][813] It also refers to meal planning,
planned physical activity, managing symptoms, blood glucose moni-­
toring, medical treatments, and managing episodes of illness and of
low and high blood glucose, as well as psychosocial, cultural, and spir-­
itual consequences of health conditions. [814][–][816]

ESC Guidelines **4109**



- Motivation and support of people with diabetes, such as: support to
stop smoking; adopt a healthy diet; increase PA and exercise; man-­
age other comorbidities, such as arthritis, renal failure, frailty, and
cognitive impairment, which increase risk of drug interactions;
and manage body weight, taking psychosocial factors into ac-­
count. [817][–][826]

- Interdisciplinary teams comprising the person (including caregivers/
family), physicians, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists, occupa-­
tional therapists, dieticians, pharmacists, physical activity specialists,
and psychologists are effective for enhancing effective communica-­
tion, collaboration, and preventing CVD. [827][,][828] The most effective


models of preventive care are those that adopt a total riskmanagement approach (i.e. those that address all of the risk factors
that impact CV health) using behavioural counselling with action

#### **13. Practical guidance**



New guidelines and clinical recommendations for treating T2DM are pa-­
tient centred and evidence based; the clinical picture and risk of
cardio-renal complications, rather than HbA1c alone, are the forefront
of personalized treatment decisions. The primary therapeutic goals in pa-­
tients with diabetes and ASCVD or increased risk of CV complications is
protecting organs and improving prognosis ( *Figure 1* ). Accordingly, these

ESC Guidelines on CVD and diabetes are based on the extensive data

from large CVOTs of recent years. For patients with T2DM and
ASCVD, a wealth of data exists but CV risk reduction in those without

ASCVD is less clear. Thus, to provide recommendations for treatment
strategies to lower CV risk in patients with T2DM but without
ASCVD or severe TOD, an appropriate tool for stratifying risk in these
patients is of major importance. Therefore, an extension of SCORE2 for
T2DM, named SCORE2-Diabetes, is provided to predict 10-year risk of
fatal and non-fatal CVD events (MI, stroke) across four European risk re-­
gions in patients without ASCVD or severe TOD. [63]

Implementation of the current Guidelines should be fostered not only
by using respective educational tools developed by the ESC including the
ESC Clinical Practice Guideline, but also by integrating it into national elec-­
tronic health-record systems and digital-based healthcare solutions.

The evidence-based concept of the current Guidelines, its key messages,
and gaps of evidence as medical needs for future research must be distrib-­
uted to all healthcare stakeholders, policymakers, politicians, and the gen-­
eral public. Awareness should be raised, respectively, on national and
European levels, including in European Union (EU) parliament and respon-­
sible commissions.

From our point of view, the current Guidelines might provide a blue-­
print for approaching multimorbid patients with common, chronic,
non-communicable diseases such as ASCVD, HF, diabetes, and CKD.
Non-communicable diseases are one of the greatest burdens on health-­
care systems and societies in Europe and many other areas of the
world. Therefore, we hope that the current Guidelines will contribute
to the ultimate goal of managing CVD and CV risk in patients with dia-­
betes: to improve patients’ prognosis and health-related quality of life.
#### **14. Key messages**

**Diagnosis of diabetes**

- Raised fasting or random glucose, elevated HbA1c, or an abnormal
OGTT is diagnostic of diabetes; a single abnormal test is sufficient


with symptoms, while two abnormal tests are usually required with-­

out symptoms.

- Undiagnosed diabetes is common, particularly in individuals with
CVD. Therefore, screening for diabetes in all individuals with CVD,
including HF, is recommended using HbA1c and/or fasting glucose.

**Cardiovascular risk assessment**

- All patients with diabetes should be evaluated for the presence of

ASCVD and severe TOD.

- In patients with T2DM without symptomatic ASCVD or severe
TOD, 10-year CVD risk via SCORE2-Diabetes should be calculated.

**Lifestyle**

- For smokers, smoking cessation is a primary target of lifestyle inter-­

vention in patients with CVD and diabetes.

- Exercise should be introduced in all patients with CVD and T2DM,
following the paradigm ‘every step counts’.

- In patients with obesity and T2DM with or without CVD, reducing
weight combined with increasing daily PA through structured exer-­
cise sessions are key lifestyle components to improve metabolic con-­
trol, improve exercise capacity, and reduce clinical outcomes.

- A Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil and/or nuts re-­

duces the incidence of major CV events in patients with CVD.

**Glycaemic targets**

- Tight glycaemic control reduces short- and long-term microvascular

disease.

- Tight glycaemic control reduces long-term macrovascular complica-­

tions (over 20 years).

- Hypoglycaemia is associated with adverse CV outcomes and is best

avoided.

**Glucose-lowering therapy**

- ASCVD complications are common in patients with T2DM.

- Glycaemic status should be systematically evaluated in all patients
with or at high risk of CVD, as diabetes status informs many clinical
decisions in cardiology.

- Independent of baseline HbA1c or additional glucose-lowering
agents, selected SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs reduce CV events
in patients with T2DM with ASCVD and/or severe TOD.

**Blood pressure**

- BP targets should be individualized for hypertensive patients.

- Optimal BP control reduces the risk of micro- and macrovascular
complications.

- Controlling BP often requires multiple drug therapies with an RAS in-­

hibitor, and a CCB or diuretic. Dual therapy is recommended as firstline treatment.

- All hypertensive patients with diabetes, irrespective of their antihypertensive treatments, should monitor their BP at home.

**Lipids**

- Statins remain the first-line and state-of-the-art therapy to decrease
LDL-C levels.

- Ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors in addition to statins (if treatment
targets have not been achieved)—or alone (in case of documented

ESC Guidelines **4111**


intolerance to statins)—significantly reduce LDL-C levels, thus im-­
proving CV outcomes.

**Antithrombotic therapy**

- Based on the presence of ASCVD and individual CV risk, antiplatelet
agents are a cornerstone of preventing CV events in patients with

diabetes.

- Shortening or scaling down DAPT to clopidogrel should be
avoided in patients with diabetes post-ACS, given their high back-­
ground CV risk, the lack of efficacy data, and the poor bio-activation
of clopidogrel.

- Platelet-function testing guided de-escalation should be avoided
based on lack of evidence and poor bio-activation of clopidogrel.

**Multifactorial approach**

- Continuous, multidisciplinary counselling is necessary to achieve
long-term lifestyle changes.

**Management of coronary artery disease**

- In patients with CAD, SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs reduce

the risk of CV events.

- In patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD, suitable coronary
anatomy for revascularization, and low predicted surgical mortality,
CABG is superior to PCI.

**Heart failure**

- The prognosis of patients with diabetes and HF is worse compared
with patients with HF without diabetes.

- Beta-blockers, ARNI/ACE-Is, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors are recom-­

mended as cornerstone therapies for patients with HFrEF and diabetes.

- Empagliflozin and dapagliflozin reduce the combined endpoint of CV
death or HF hospitalization in patients with HF and a LVEF >40%.

- Glucose-lowering treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with
diabetes and HF reduces HF-related endpoints.

- Saxagliptin and pioglitazone increase the risk of HF hospitalization in
patients with diabetes and HF.

**Arrhythmias**

- AF is common in patients with diabetes, and increases mortality, risk
of stroke, and risk of HF.

- Opportunistic screening for AF is recommended for patients with
diabetes aged ≥65 years by palpating pulse (or using wearable de-­
vices) and systematic ECG screening when age is ≥75 years. AF
should always be confirmed by ECG.

- Opportunistic screening for AF by pulse taking or ECG is recom-­

mended in patients with diabetes aged <65 years in view of their
risk of AF and the possibly associated risk of ischaemic stroke.

**Chronic kidney disease**

- CKD in patients with diabetes is associated with high risk of develop-­

ing kidney failure and CVD.

- Patients with diabetes should be regularly screened for CKD, or have
their CKD staged, by assessing eGFR and UACR.

- Certain ACE-I/ARBs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and finerenone reduce the risk
of kidney failure and the risk of CVD in patients with T2DM and CKD.


**Aortic and peripheral arterial diseases**

- LEAD is a common complication in patients with diabetes and asso-­

ciated with poorer prognosis.

- Patients with diabetes are at higher risk of CLTI as the first clinical
manifestation of LEAD, supporting regular screening with ABI meas-­
urement for early diagnosis.

- The management of patients with LEAD and indications for different
treatment strategies are similar in patients with or without diabetes,
although the options for revascularization may be poorer in patients

with diabetes because of diffuse and distal lesions.

**Type 1 diabetes**

- Glucose-lowering therapy in T1DM should follow principles of pa-­

tient self-management under the guidance of the diabetes healthcare
multidisciplinary team.

**Person-centred care**

- A person-centred approach is a key factor in successful selfmanagement, resulting in greater patient satisfaction, adherence to
therapeutic plans, and improved health outcomes.

- Important factors for self-management of diabetes and comorbidities
are education, motivation, empowerment, and continuing supportive

care of individuals.
#### **15. Gaps in evidence**

**Diagnosis of diabetes**

- Global screening programmes for diabetes, adjusted for regional
demographics and ethnic groups, are required to establish the
most accurate and cost-effective screening test.

**Lifestyle**

- RCTs of long-term exercise intervention to reduce CV outcomes are
needed in different patient groups with diabetes and CVD, e.g. CAD,
HFpEF, HFrEF, AF, or PAD.

- Large RCTs assessing the benefit of a multidisciplinary team to in-­

crease adherence to lifestyle interventions and optimal medication
are needed in patients with T2DM and CVD.

- The applicability and best practice of telehealth needs to be evaluated
in elderly and frail patients with T2DM and CVD.

**Glycaemic targets**

- The independent role of hypoglycaemia, glycaemic variability,
time-in-range, and post-prandial hyperglycaemia in CV pathology re-­
quires further research.

- Large-scale studies are required to understand the role of modern
glucose-monitoring strategies (CGM) in improving macrovascular

and HF outcomes.

**Glucose-lowering therapy**

- It remains unclear if the combination therapy of GLP-1 RAs and
SGLT2 inhibitors is complementary in cardio-renal outcomes in pa-­
tients with T2DM.

- It needs to be examined if more intensive glycaemic control, achieved
with novel medications, might prove to have incremental CV efficacy.

**4112** ESC Guidelines


**Blood pressure**

- High-quality data on managing BP in T1DM are lacking.

- Optimal targets for (isolated) DBP in patients with diabetes and
hypertension remain inconclusive.

- More information on optimizing CV protection in diabetes by man-­

aging BP based on out-of-office BP levels should be provided by ran-­
domized intervention trials.

**Lipids**

- Optimal LDL-C target levels for patients with diabetes need to
be established; good scientific evidence is especially missing in
T1DM.

- Novel lipid-lowering drugs, such as inclisiran need efficacy data on CV
endpoints both in the general population and in patients with

diabetes.

**Antithrombotic therapy**

- More data on primary CV prevention are needed for patients with

T1DM.

- Future phase 3 RCTs testing antithrombotic drugs in CV prevention
should share homogeneous classifications of bleeding to make the
benefit-risk profile of mono- or combined therapy comparable
across different studies.

- The benefit-risk profile of ASA in CV prevention in patients with dia-­

betes, documented significant atherosclerotic lesions (peripheral or
coronary), or high CAC score but without history of stroke or MI
should be further investigated in RCTs.

- Since documented kidney and/or eye microvascular disease inde-­

pendently predict future CV events, it needs to be assessed whether
patients with diabetes with microvascular disease and no history of
MACE would benefit from early primary prophylaxis.

- It needs to be demonstrated in adequately powered, superiority,
efficacy-based RCTs whether 12-month DAPT post-ACS can be re-­
duced to a shorter period in patients with diabetes using SAPT with
ASA or with a P2Y 12 inhibitor.

- The optimal duration of TAT post-ACS in patients with diabetes and

AF needs to be established.

**Multifactorial approach**

- An optimal intervention protocol to improve adherence remains to
be established, particularly addressing patients with diabetes and co-­
morbidities, and the elderly population.

- Sex and ethnicity differences regarding efficacy of multifactorial inter-­

ventions need to be evaluated.

- Evaluation of E-health applications to improve adherence to lifestyle
intervention and medication also assessing clinical outcomes is
needed in patients with CVD and diabetes.

**Management of coronary artery disease**

- Optimal glycaemic control and in-hospital anti-glycaemic strategies
for the outcomes of ACS and stable CAD, as well as after coronary
revascularization, remain to be established.

- Although newer-generation DES have improved outcomes in pa-­

tients with diabetes, RCTs are needed to determine whether they
can reduce the gap in outcomes between CABG and PCI.

- No direct comparison RCT has focused on revascularization in pa-­

tients with diabetes and left main disease.



- Robust data on patients with CAD and T1DM are missing.

- The effect of anti-inflammatory strategies in patients with diabetes
should be assessed in dedicated trials.

**Heart failure**

- The effect of finerenone on cardio-renal endpoints in patients with
diabetes and HFrEF or HFpEF needs to be examined.

- More mechanistic studies are warranted to better understand how

SGLT2 inhibitors improve HF outcomes.

- Research is needed to guide OMT in patients with HF and T1DM.

- The prognostic benefit of HF screening with BNP/NT-proBNP in
asymptomatic patients with diabetes needs to be determined.

**Arrhythmias**

- Better evidence is needed regarding the risks of atrial and ventricular
arrhythmias associated with T1DM and how they should be optimally
managed.

- Optimal screening methods and treatment for patients with diabetes
still need to be defined in RCTs.

- The role of AF in diabetes needs to be evaluated in CVOTs.

- Whether SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of CV death by reducing the
risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias should be more precisely evaluated.

**Chronic kidney disease**

- CV and renal effects of using non-steroidal MRAs in patients with CKD on
a combined ACE-I/ARB + SGLT2-inhibitor regimen need to be explored.

- Net benefits of antiplatelet therapy in patients with diabetes and
CKD with and without ASCVD need to be examined.

**Aortic and peripheral arterial diseases**

- The frequency and mode of vascular screening in patients with dia-­

betes needs to be assessed.

- Specific trials are needed to help clinicians choose different pharma-­

cological strategies according to the presence of PAD.

**Type 1 diabetes**

- Comprehensive cardio-protection management in patients with
early-onset T1DM needs to be evaluated.

- The role of ameliorating insulin resistance and using adjunctive ther-­

apies to reduce CV risk remains to be elucidated.

- Lifestyle intervention trials in patients with T1DM and CVD are lacking.

**Person-centred care**

- Better CVD management of women with diabetes is needed.

- Effective interdisciplinary approaches to better manage glycaemic
control and minimize the risk of complications are required.

- Data are lacking on personalization of mobile Health (mHealth) by
assessing how individual factors, such as health literacy, culture, socio-­
economic status, ageing, behaviours, and treatment plan, impact pa-­
tient engagement with mHealth tools and clinical outcomes.
#### **16. Sex differences**

Epidemiological studies suggest that diabetes is a stronger risk factor for
CVD in women compared with men. Data from large CVOTs do not sug-­
gest sex differences with respect to the benefit of CV risk-reducing

ESC Guidelines **4113**


strategies in T2DM, i.e. treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs.
Although women are under-represented in clinical trials, there is no evi-­
dence for sex-specific recommendations for managing CVD in patients
with diabetes. However, epidemiological and real-world data suggest that
guideline-directed therapy in women is less likely to be applied compared


with men. [835][–][837] This should be explored in future studies. Therefore,
we recommend implementing sex-balanced recruitment strategies for fu-­
ture CVOTs. In addition, pre-specified analyses addressing sex differences
are needed. Most importantly, every effort should be made to ensure wo-­
men receive equal healthcare opportunities in managing CVD in diabetes.

|Oral anticoagulation is recommended for preventing stroke in patients with AF and diabetes and with at least one additional<br>(CHA DS-VASc) risk factor for stroke.<br>2 2|I|A|
|---|---|---|
|For preventing stroke in AF, NOACs are recommended in preference to VKAs, with the exception of patients with mechanical valve<br>prostheses or moderate to severe mitral stenosis.|I|A|


**Recommendations for patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes**






|Intensive LDL-C lowering with statins or a statin/ezetimibe combination is recommended.|I|A|
|---|---|---|
|A BP target of ≤130/80 mmHg is recommended to reduce risk of CVD and albuminuria.|I|A|
|Personalized HbA1c targets 6.5–8.0% (48–64 mmol/mol) are recommended, with a target <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol) to reduce<br>microvascular complications, wherever possible.|I|A|
|The maximum tolerated dose of an ACE-I or ARB is recommended.|I|A|
|A SGLT2 inhibitor (canagliflozin, empaglifol zin, or dapaglifol zin) is recommended in patients with T2DM and CKD with an eGFR ≥20 mL/<br>min/1.73 m2 to reduce the risk of CVD and kidney failure.|I|A|
|Finerenone is recommended in addition to an ACE-I or ARB in patients with T2DM and eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 with a UACR ≥30 mg/<br>mmol (≥300 mg/g), or eGFR 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR ≥3 mg/mmol (≥30 mg/g) to reduce CV events and kidney failure.|I|A|
|A GLP-1 RA is recommended at eGFR >15 mL/min/1.73 m2 to achieve adequate glycaemic control, due to low risk of hypoglycaemia and<br>benefci ial effects on weight, CV risk, and albuminuria.|I|A|
|Low-dose ASA (75–100 mg o.d.) is recommended in patients with CKD and ASCVD.|I|A|
|It is recommended that patients with diabetes are routinely screened for kidney disease by assessing eGFR defined by CKD-EPI and UACR.|I|B|
|Treatment with intensive medical or an initial invasive strategy is recommended in people with CKD, diabetes, and stable moderate or<br>severe CAD, due to similar outcomes.|I|B|
|Combined use of an ARB with an ACE-I is not recommended.|III|B|





|In patients with diabetes and symptomatic LEAD, antiplatelet therapy is recommended.|I|A|
|---|---|---|
|In patients with diabetes and CLTI, it is recommended to assess the risk of amputation; the WIfI score is useful for this purpose.|I|B|
|As patients with diabetes and LEAD are at very high CV risk, an LDL-C target of <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL) and an LDL-C reduction of at<br>least 50% is recommended.|I|B|
|Screening for LEAD is recommended on a regular basis, with clinical assessment and/or ABI measurement.|I|C|
|Patient education about foot care is recommended in patients with diabetes, and especially those with LEAD, even if asymptomatic. Early<br>recognition of tissue loss and/or infection, and referral to a multidisciplinary team, is mandatory to improve limb salvage.|I|C|
|An ABI ≤0.90 is diagnostic of LEAD, irrespective of symptoms. In symptomatic cases, further assessment including duplex ultrasound is<br>recommended.|I|C|
|When ABI is elevated (>1.40), other non-invasive tests, including TBI or duplex ultrasound, are recommended.|I|C|
|Duplex ultrasound is recommended as the first-line imaging method to assess the anatomy and haemodynamic status of lower-extremity<br>arteries.|I|C|

ESC Guidelines **4117**

In case of CLTI, revascularization is recommended whenever feasible for limb salvage. **I** **C**

**Carotid artery disease in patients with diabetes**


In patients with diabetes and carotid artery disease, it is recommended to implement the same diagnostic work-up and therapeutic

**I** **C**
strategies (medical, surgical, or endovascular) as in patients without diabetes.

**Aortic aneurysm in patients with diabetes**


In patients with diabetes and aortic aneurysm, it is recommended to implement the same diagnostic work-up and therapeutic strategies

**I** **C**
(medical, surgical, or endovascular) as in patients without diabetes.

**Recommendations for type 1 diabetes and cardiovascular disease**


|In patients with T1DM, it is recommended that adjustment of glucose-lowering medication follows principles of patient self-management<br>under the guidance of the diabetes healthcare multidisciplinary team.|I|C|
|---|---|---|
|Avoiding hypoglycaemic episodes is recommended, particularly in those with established CVD.|I|C|


**Recommendations for person-centred care in diabetes**


|Structured education programmes are recommended in patients with diabetes to improve diabetes knowledge, glycaemic control, disease<br>management, and patient empowerment.|I|A|
|---|---|---|
|Person-centred care is recommended to facilitate shared control and decision-making within the context of person priorities and goals.|I|C|

#### **18. Quality indicators**

Quality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care qual-­
ity, including structural, process, and outcomes of care. [838] They may also
serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to Guideline recommen-­
dations, through associated quality-improvement initiatives and bench-­
marking of care clinicians. [839][,][840] As such, the role of QIs in improving
care and outcomes for CVD is increasingly recognized by healthcare au-­
thorities, professional organizations, payers, and the public. [838]

The ESC understands the need for measuring and reporting quality
and outcomes of CV care and has established methods for developing
the ESC QIs for quantifying care and outcomes for CVDs. [838] To date,
the ESC has developed QI suites for a number of CVDs in parallel with
writing the ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines. [841][–][844]

The ESC aims to harmonize its QIs for various CV conditions and in-­
tegrate them with ESC registries, providing real-world data about the
patterns and outcomes of care for CVD across Europe. [845]
