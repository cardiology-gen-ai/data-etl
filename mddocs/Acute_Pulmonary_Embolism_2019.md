### 1 Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management
strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines
and their recommendations should facilitate decision making of
health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and

caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other societies and organisations. Because of their impact on clinical practice,
quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be
[found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)

[ting-ESC-Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official posi-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)



The ESC carries out a number of registries which are essential to
assess, diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources and adherence to Guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world, based
on data collected during routine clinical practice.
The guidelines are developed together with derivative educational
material addressing the cultural and professional needs for cardiologists and allied professionals. Collecting high-quality observational
data, at appropriate time interval following the release of ESC
Guidelines, will help evaluate the level of implementation of the
Guidelines, checking in priority the key end points defined with the

ESC Guidelines and Education Committees and Task Force members

in charge.
The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in
order to represent professionals involved with the medical care of
patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a
comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of
a given condition according to ESC Committee for Practice
Guidelines (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the
risk�benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and
graded according to predefined scales, as outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. These forms were
[compiled into one file and can be found on the ESC website (http://](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[www.escardio.org/guidelines). Any changes in declarations of interest](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC and
updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from
the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.

The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
Guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement
process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive
review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions
the Guidelines are approved by all the experts involved in the Task
Force. The finalized document is approved by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The Guidelines were developed
after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge
and the evidence available at the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation of educational tools and implementation programmes for the
recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions,
summary slides, booklets with essential messages, summary cards
for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital applications
(smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus, for
more detailed information, the user should always access to the
full text version of the Guidelines, which is freely available via the
ESC website and hosted on the EHJ website. The National
Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, translate and
implement all ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes are

needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease

may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clini
cal recommendations.

Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines fully
into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in the

### 2 Introduction

2.1 Why do we need new Guidelines on
the diagnosis and management of
pulmonary embolism?
This document follows the previous ESC Guidelines focusing on the
clinical management of pulmonary embolism (PE), published in 2000,
2008, and 2014. Many recommendations have been retained or their
validity has been reinforced; however, new data have extended or

ESC Guidelines 549


modified our knowledge in respect of the optimal diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of patients with PE. These new aspects have been
integrated into previous knowledge to suggest optimal and—whenever
possible—objectively validated management strategies for patients
with suspected or confirmed PE. To limit the length of the printed text,
additional information, tables, figures, and references are available as
[supplementary data on the ESC website (www.escardio.org).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)

These Guidelines focus on the diagnosis and management of acute
PE in adult patients. For further details specifically related to the diagnosis and management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the reader is
referred to the joint consensus document of the ESC Working
Groups of Aorta and Peripheral Vascular Diseases, and Pulmonary
Circulation and Right Ventricular Function. [1]

### 3 General considerations

3.1 Epidemiology
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), clinically presenting as DVT or
PE, is globally the third most frequent acute cardiovascular syndrome behind myocardial infarction and stroke. [2] In epidemiologi
�
cal studies, annual incidence rates for PE range from 39 115 per
100 000 population; for DVT, incidence rates range from 53�162
per 100 000 population. [3][,][4] Cross-sectional data show that the
incidence of VTE is almost eight times higher in individuals aged
>_80 years than in the fifth decade of life. [3] In parallel, longitudinal
studies have revealed a rising tendency in annual PE incidence
rates [4][�][7] over time. Together with the substantial hospitalassociated, preventable, and indirect annual expenditures for VTE
(an estimated total of up to e8.5 billion in the European Union), [8]

these data demonstrate the importance of PE and DVT in ageing
populations in Europe and other areas of the world. They further
suggest that VTE will increasingly pose a burden on health systems
worldwide in the years to come.

PE may cause <_300 000 deaths per year in the US, ranking high
among the causes of cardiovascular mortality. [3] In six European
countries with a total population of 454.4 million, more than 370

000 deaths were related to VTE in 2004, as estimated on the basis
of an epidemiological model. [9] Of these patients, 34% died suddenly or within a few hours of the acute event, before therapy
could be initiated or take effect. Of the other patients, death
resulted from acute PE that was diagnosed after death in 59% and
only 7% of patients who died early were correctly diagnosed with
PE before death. [9]

ESC Guidelines 551


Time trend analyses in European, Asian, and North American
populations suggest that case fatality rates of acute PE may be
decreasing. [4][�][7][,][10][,][11] Increased use of more effective therapies and
interventions, and possibly better adherence to guidelines, [12][,][13]

has most likely exerted a significant positive effect on the prognosis of PE in recent years. However, there is also a tendency
towards overdiagnosis of (subsegmental or even non-existent) PE
in the modern era, [14] and this might in turn lead to a false drop in
case fatality rates by inflating the denominator, i.e. the total num
ber of PE cases.

Figure 1 summarizes the existing data on global trends in PE, highlighting increasing incidence rates in parallel with decreasing case
fatality rates over an �15 year period.
In children, studies have reported an annual incidence of VTE of
between 53�57 per 100 000 among hospitalized patients, [19][,][20] and
between 1.4�4.9 per 100 000 in the community overall. [21][,][22]

There is an extensive collection of predisposing environmental and
genetic factors for VTE; a list of predisposing (risk) factors is shown in
Table 3. VTE is considered to be a consequence of the interaction
between patient-related—usually permanent—risk factors and setting-related—usually temporary—risk factors. Since categorization
of temporary and permanent risk factors for VTE is important for
assessing the risk of recurrence, and consequently for decisionmaking on chronic anticoagulation, it is discussed in more detail in sec
tion 8 of these Guidelines.

Major trauma, surgery, lower-limb fractures and joint replacements, and spinal cord injury are strong provoking factors for
VTE. [23][,][24] Cancer is a well-recognized predisposing factor for VTE.
The risk of VTE varies with different types of cancer; [25][,][26] pancreatic cancer, haematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastric can


has most likely exerted a significant positive effect on the prognosis of PE in recent years. However, there is also a tendency
towards overdiagnosis of (subsegmental or even non-existent) PE
in the modern era, [14] and this might in turn lead to a false drop in
case fatality rates by inflating the denominator, i.e. the total num
ber of PE cases.

Figure 1 summarizes the existing data on global trends in PE, highlighting increasing incidence rates in parallel with decreasing case
fatality rates over an �15 year period.
In children, studies have reported an annual incidence of VTE of
between 53�57 per 100 000 among hospitalized patients, [19][,][20] and
between 1.4�4.9 per 100 000 in the community overall. [21][,][22]

Major trauma, surgery, lower-limb fractures and joint replacements, and spinal cord injury are strong provoking factors for
VTE. [23][,][24] Cancer is a well-recognized predisposing factor for VTE.
The risk of VTE varies with different types of cancer; [25][,][26] pancreatic cancer, haematological malignancies, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and brain cancer carry the highest risk. [27][,][28] Moreover, cancer


is a strong risk factor for all-cause mortality following an episode
of VTE. [29]

Oestrogen-containing oral contraceptive agents are associated
with an elevated VTE risk, and contraceptive use is the most frequent
VTE risk factor in women of reproductive age. [30][�][32] More specifically,
combined oral contraceptives (containing both an oestrogen and a
progestogen) are associated with an approximately two- to six-fold
increase in VTE risk over baseline. [32][,][33] In general, the absolute VTE
risk remains low in the majority of the >100 million combined oral
contraceptive users worldwide; [34] however, VTE risk factors, including severe inherited thrombophilia (discussed in section 8), [35] increase
this risk. Third-generation combined oral contraceptives, containing
progestogens such as desogestrel or gestodene, are associated with a
higher VTE risk than the second-generation combined oral contraceptives, which contain progestogens such as levonorgestrel or norgestrel. [36][,][37] On the other hand, hormone-releasing intrauterine
devices and some progesterone-only pills (used at contraceptive
doses) are not associated with a significant increase in VTE risk; [33][,][38]

consequently, and following counselling and full risk assessment,
these options are often proposed to women with a personal or
strong family history of VTE.

In post-menopausal women who receive hormone replacement
therapy, the risk of VTE varies widely depending on the formulation
used. [39]

Infection is a common trigger for VTE. [23][,][40][,][41] Blood transfusion
and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents are also associated with an
increased risk of VTE. [23][,][42]

In children, PE is usually associated with DVT and is rarely unpro
voked. Serious chronic medical conditions and central venous lines
are considered likely triggers of PE. [43]

VTE may be viewed as part of the cardiovascular disease continuum, and common risk factors—such as cigarette smoking,
obesity, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, and diabetes

mellitus [44][�][47] —are shared with arterial disease, notably atherosclerosis. [48][�][51] However, this may be an indirect association
mediated, at least in part, by the complications of coronary
artery disease and, in the case of smoking, cancer. [52][,][53]

Myocardial infarction and heart failure increase the risk of
PE. [54][,][55] Conversely, patients with VTE have an increased risk of
subsequent myocardial infarction and stroke, or peripheral arterial embolization. [56]




3.3 Pathophysiology and determinants of
outcome

Acute PE interferes with both circulation and gas exchange. Right
ventricular (RV) failure due to acute pressure overload is considered the primary cause of death in severe PE. Pulmonary artery
pressure (PAP) increases if >30�50% of the total cross-sectional
area of the pulmonary arterial bed is occluded by thromboemboli. [57] PE-induced vasoconstriction, mediated by the release of

thromboxane A2 and serotonin, contributes to the initial increase
in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) after PE. [58] Anatomical
obstruction and hypoxic vasoconstriction in the affected lung area
lead to an increase in PVR, and a proportional decrease in arterial
compliance. [59]

The abrupt increase in PVR results in RV dilation, which alters the

�
contractile properties of the RV myocardium via the Frank Starling
mechanism. The increase in RV pressure and volume leads to an
increase in wall tension and myocyte stretch. The contraction time of
the RV is prolonged, while neurohumoral activation leads to inotropic and chronotropic stimulation. Together with systemic vasoconstriction, these compensatory mechanisms increase PAP,
improving flow through the obstructed pulmonary vascular bed and
thus temporarily stabilizing systemic blood pressure (BP). However,
the extent of immediate adaptation is limited, as a nonpreconditioned, thin-walled RV is unable to generate a mean PAP
>40 mmHg.
Prolongation of RV contraction time into early diastole in the left
ventricle (LV) leads to leftward bowing of the interventricular septum. [60] The desynchronization of the ventricles may be exacerbated
by the development of right bundle branch block. As a result, LV filling is impeded in early diastole, and this may lead to a reduction in
the cardiac output (CO), and contribute to systemic hypotension
and haemodynamic instability. [61]

As described above, excessive neurohumoral activation in PE can

be the result of both abnormal RV wall tension and circulatory shock.
The finding of massive infiltrates of inflammatory cells in the RV myocardia of patients who died within 48 h of acute PE may be explained
by high levels of epinephrine released as a result of the PE-induced
‘myocarditis’. [62] This inflammatory response might explain the secondary haemodynamic destabilization that sometimes occurs 24�48 h
after acute PE, although early recurrence of PE may be an alternative
explanation in some of these cases.

Finally, the association between elevated circulating levels of biomarkers of myocardial injury and an adverse early outcome indicates
that RV ischaemia is of pathophysiological significance in the acute
phase of PE. [63][,][64] Although RV infarction is uncommon after PE, it is
likely that the imbalance between oxygen supply and demand can
result in damage to cardiomyocytes, and further reduce contractile
forces. Systemic hypotension is a critical element in this process, leading to impairment of the coronary driving pressure to the overloaded

RV.

The detrimental effects of acute PE on the RV myocardium and
the circulation are summarized in Figure 2.
Respiratory failure in PE is predominantly a consequence of
haemodynamic disturbances. [66] Low CO results in desaturation of

the mixed venous blood. Zones of reduced flow in obstructed

pulmonary arteries, combined with zones of overflow in the capillary bed served by non-obstructed pulmonary vessels, result in
ventilation/perfusion mismatch, which contributes to hypoxaemia.
In about one-third of patients, right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale can be detected by echocardiography; this is
caused by an inverted pressure gradient between the right atrium
(RA) and left atrium, and may lead to severe hypoxaemia, and an
increased risk of paradoxical embolization and stroke. [67] Finally,
even if they do not affect haemodynamics, small distal emboli may
create areas of alveolar haemorrhage resulting in haemoptysis,


presentation is known as ‘pulmonary infarction’. Its effect on gas
exchange is normally mild, except in patients with pre-existing
cardiorespiratory disease.

In view of the above pathophysiological considerations, acute RV
failure, defined as a rapidly progressive syndrome with systemic congestion resulting from impaired RV filling and/or reduced RV flow output, [68] is a critical determinant of clinical severity and outcome in acute
PE. Accordingly, clinical symptoms, and signs of overt RV failure and
haemodynamic instability, indicate a high risk of early (in-hospital or
30 day) mortality. High-risk PE is defined by haemodynamic instability
and encompasses the forms of clinical presentation shown in Table 4.

554 ESC Guidelines


As an immediately life-threatening situation, high-risk PE requires
an emergency diagnostic (upon suspicion) and therapeutic (upon
confirmation or if the level of suspicion is sufficiently high) strategy, as
outlined in section 7. However, the absence of haemodynamic instability does not exclude beginning (and possibly progressing) RV dysfunction, and thus an elevated PE-related early risk. In this large
population, further assessment (outlined in sections 5 and 7) is necessary to determine the level of risk and adjust management decisions
accordingly.
### 4 Diagnosis

The increased awareness of venous thromboembolic disease and the

ever-increasing availability of non-invasive imaging tests, mainly computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA), have generated a tendency for clinicians to suspect and initiate a diagnostic
workup for PE more frequently than in the past. This changing attitude is illustrated by the rates of PE confirmation among patients
undergoing diagnostic workup: these were as low as 5% in recent
North American diagnostic studies, in sharp contrast to the approximately 50% prevalence reported back in the early 1980s. [71]

Therefore, it is critical that, when evaluating non-invasive diagnostic
strategies for PE in the modern era, it is ensured that they are capable
of safely excluding PE in contemporary patient populations with a
rather low pre-test probability of the disease. [72] Conversely, a positive test should have an adequate specificity to set the indication for
anticoagulant treatment.

4.1 Clinical presentation
The clinical signs and symptoms of acute PE are non-specific. In most
cases, PE is suspected in a patient with dyspnoea, chest pain, presyncope or syncope, or haemoptysis. [73][�][75] Haemodynamic instability
is a rare but important form of clinical presentation, as it indicates
central or extensive PE with severely reduced haemodynamic
reserve. Syncope may occur, and is associated with a higher prevalence of haemodynamic instability and RV dysfunction. [76] Conversely,
and according to the results of a recent study, acute PE may be a frequent finding in patients presenting with syncope (17%), even in the
presence of an alternative explanation. [77]

In some cases, PE may be asymptomatic or discovered incidentally
during diagnostic workup for another disease.
Dyspnoea may be acute and severe in central PE; in small peripheral PE, it is often mild and may be transient. In patients with preexisting heart failure or pulmonary disease, worsening dyspnoea may
be the only symptom indicative of PE. Chest pain is a frequent symptom of PE and is usually caused by pleural irritation due to distal
emboli causing pulmonary infarction. [78] In central PE, chest pain may
have a typical angina character, possibly reflecting RV ischaemia, and
requiring differential diagnosis from an acute coronary syndrome or

aortic dissection.

In addition to symptoms, knowledge of the predisposing factors
for VTE is important in determining the clinical probability of the
disease, which increases with the number of predisposing factors
present; however, in 40% of patients with PE, no predisposing factors are found. [79] Hypoxaemia is frequent, but <_40% of patients
have normal arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) and 20% have a

normal alveolar�arterial oxygen gradient. [80][,][81] Hypocapnia is also
often present. A chest X-ray is frequently abnormal and, although
its findings are usually non-specific in PE, it may be useful for
excluding other causes of dyspnoea or chest pain. [82]

Electrocardiographic changes indicative of RV strain—such as
inversion of T waves in leads V1�V4, a QR pattern in V1, a
S1Q3T3 pattern, and incomplete or complete right bundle branch
block—are usually found in more severe cases of PE; [83] in milder
cases, the only abnormality may be sinus tachycardia, present in
40% of patients. Finally, atrial arrhythmias, most frequently atrial
fibrillation, may be associated with acute PE.

4.2 Assessment of clinical (pre-test)
probability
The combination of symptoms and clinical findings with the presence
of predisposing factors for VTE allows the classification of patients
with suspected PE into distinct categories of clinical or pre-test probability, which correspond to an increasing actual prevalence of confirmed PE. This pre-test assessment can be done either by implicit
(empirical) clinical judgement or by using prediction rules. As the
post-test (i.e. after an imaging test) probability of PE depends not only
on the characteristics of the diagnostic test itself but also on the pretest probability, this is a key step in all diagnostic algorithms for PE.
The value of empirical clinical judgement has been confirmed in
several large series. [84][,][85] Clinical judgement usually includes

ESC Guidelines 555


commonplace tests such as chest X-rays and electrocardiograms for
differential diagnosis. However, as clinical judgement lacks standardization, several explicit clinical prediction rules have been developed.
Of these, the most frequently used prediction rules are the revised
Geneva rule (Table 5) and the Wells rule (see Supplementary Data
[Table 1).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data) [86] Both prediction rules have been simplified in an attempt
to increase their adoption into clinical practice; [87][,][88] the simplified versions have been externally validated. [89][,][90]

Regardless of the score used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE can be expected to be �10% in the low-probability category,
30% in the moderate-probability category, and 65% in the highprobability category. [92] When the two-level classification is used, the
proportion of patients with confirmed PE is �12% in the PE-unlikely category and 30% in the PE-likely category. [92] A direct prospective comparison of these rules confirmed a similar diagnostic performance. [89]

4.3 Avoiding overuse of diagnostic tests
for pulmonary embolism
Searching for PE in every patient with dyspnoea or chest pain may
lead to high costs and complications of unnecessary tests. The
Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) were developed for
emergency department patients with the purpose of selecting, on
clinical grounds, patients whose likelihood of having PE is so low that
diagnostic workup should not even be initiated. [93] They comprise
eight clinical variables significantly associated with an absence of PE:
age < 50 years; pulse < 100 beats per minute; SaO 2 >94%; no unilateral leg swelling; no haemoptysis; no recent trauma or surgery; no
history of VTE; and no oral hormone use. The results of a prospective validation study, [94] and those of a randomized non-inferiority
management study, [95] suggested safe exclusion of PE in patients with
low clinical probability who, in addition, met all criteria of the PERC
rule. However, the low overall prevalence of PE in these studies [94][,][95]

does not support the generalizability of the results.

4.4 D-dimer testing
D-dimer levels are elevated in plasma in the presence of acute thrombosis because of simultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The negative predictive value of D-dimer testing is high, and a
normal D-dimer level renders acute PE or DVT unlikely. On the
other hand, the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is
low and D-dimer testing is not useful for confirmation of PE. D-dimer
is also more frequently elevated in patients with cancer, [96][,][97] in hospitalized patients, [89][,][98] in severe infection or inflammatory disease, and
during pregnancy. [99][,][100] Accordingly, the number of patients in whom
D-dimer must be measured to exclude one PE (number needed to
test) rises from 3 in the general population of an emergency department to >_10 in the specific situations listed above.

As a number of D-dimer assays are available, clinicians should
become aware of the diagnostic performance of the test used in their
own hospital. The quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) or ELISA-derived assays have a diagnostic sensitivity of >_95%,
and can be used to exclude PE in patients with either low or intermediate pre-test probability. In the emergency department, a negative ELISA
D-dimer can, in combination with clinical probability, exclude the disease without further testing in �30% of patients with suspected


embolic risk was <1% in patients with low or intermediate clinical probability who were left untreated on the basis of a negative test result. [104]

4.4.1 Age-adjusted D-dimer cut-offs
The specificity of D-dimer in suspected PE decreases steadily with age
to �10% in patients >80 years of age. [105] The use of age-adjusted cutoffs may improve the performance of D-dimer testing in the elderly. A
multinational prospective management study evaluated a previously
validated age-adjusted cut-off (age � 10 mg/L, for patients aged >50
years) in a cohort of 3346 patients. [106] Patients with a normal ageadjusted D-dimer value did not undergo CTPA; they were left
untreated and followed for a 3 month period. Among the 766 patients
who were >_75 years of age, 673 had a non-high clinical probability.
Use of the age-adjusted (instead of the ‘standard’ 500 mg/L) D-dimer
cut-off increased the number of patients in whom PE could be
excluded from 6.4 to 30%, without additional false-negative findings. [106]

4.4.2 D-dimer cut-offs adapted to clinical probability
A prospective management trial used the ‘YEARS’ clinical decision
rule, which consists of three clinical items of the Wells score (see
[Supplementary Data Table 1)—namely signs of DVT, haemoptysis,](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
and PE more likely than an alternative diagnosis—plus D-dimer concentrations. [107] PE was considered to be excluded in patients without
clinical items and D-dimer levels <1000 ng/mL, or in patients with
one or more clinical items and D-dimer levels <500 ng/mL. All other
patients underwent CTPA. Of the 2946 patients (85%) in whom PE
was ruled out at baseline and who were left untreated, 18 [0.61%,

�
95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 0.96%] were diagnosed with
symptomatic VTE during the 3 month follow-up. CTPA was avoided
in 48% of the included patients using this algorithm, compared to
34% if the Wells rule and a fixed D-dimer threshold of 500 ng/mL
would have been applied. [107]

4.4.3 Point-of-care D-dimer assays
In certain situations, notably in community or primary care medicine,
‘on-the-spot’ D-dimer testing may have advantages over referring a
patient to a central laboratory for D-dimer testing. This may particularly apply to remote areas where access to healthcare is limited. [108][,][109] However, point-of-care assays have a lower sensitivity and
negative predictive value compared with laboratory-based D-dimer
tests. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, sensitivity of point-of
�
care D-dimer assays was 88% (95% CI 83 92%) whereas conventional laboratory-based D-dimer testing had a sensitivity of at least
95%. [110] As a result, point-of-care D-dimer assays should only be
used in patients with a low pre-test probability. In these situations, PE
could be ruled out in 46% of patients with suspected PE without proceeding to imaging tests (with a failure rate of 1.5%), as suggested by a
prospective study in Dutch primary care. [111]

4.5 Computed tomographic pulmonary
angiography
Multidetector CTPA is the method of choice for imaging the pulmonary vasculature in patients with suspected PE. It allows adequate visualization of the pulmonary arteries down to the subsegmental
level. [112][�][114] The Prospective Investigation On Pulmonary Embolism
Diagnosis (PIOPED) II study observed a sensitivity of 83% and a


Regardless of the score used, the proportion of patients with confirmed PE can be expected to be �10% in the low-probability category,
30% in the moderate-probability category, and 65% in the highprobability category. [92] When the two-level classification is used, the
proportion of patients with confirmed PE is �12% in the PE-unlikely category and 30% in the PE-likely category. [92] A direct prospective comparison of these rules confirmed a similar diagnostic performance. [89]

does not support the generalizability of the results.

specificity of 96% for (mainly four-detector) CTPA in PE diagnosis. [115]

PIOPED II also highlighted the influence of pre-test clinical probability
on the predictive value of multidetector CTPA. In patients with a low
or intermediate clinical probability of PE, a negative CTPA had a high
negative predictive value for PE (96 and 89%, respectively), but its negative predictive value was only 60% if the pre-test probability was high.
Conversely, the positive predictive value of a positive CTPA was high

�
(92 96%) in patients with an intermediate or high clinical probability,
but much lower (58%) in patients with a low pre-test likelihood of
PE. [115] Therefore, clinicians should consider further testing in case of
discordance between clinical judgement and the CTPA result.

Several studies have provided evidence in favour of CTPA as a
stand-alone imaging test for excluding PE. Taken together, the available data suggest that a negative CTPA result is an adequate criterion
for the exclusion of PE in patients with low or intermediate clinical
probability of PE. On the other hand, it remains controversial
whether patients with a negative CTPA and a high clinical probability
should be further investigated.

the diagnosis and management of CTEPH is discussed in section 10.
The major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues
related to the use of CTPA in the diagnosis of PE are summarized in

Table 6.

4.6 Lung scintigraphy
The planar ventilation/perfusion [V/Q (lung scintigraphy)] scan is an
established diagnostic test for suspected PE. Perfusion scans are combined with ventilation studies, for which multiple tracers such as
xenon-133 gas, krypton-81 gas, technetium-99m-labelled aerosols,
or technetium-99m-labelled carbon microparticles (Technegas) can
be used. The purpose of the ventilation scan is to increase specificity:
in acute PE, ventilation is expected to be normal in hypoperfused segments (mismatched). Being a lower-radiation and contrast mediumsparing procedure, the V/Q scan may preferentially be applied in outpatients with a low clinical probability and a normal chest X-ray, in
young (particularly female) patients, in pregnant women, in patients

ESC Guidelines 557


with history of contrast medium-induced anaphylaxis, and patients
with severe renal failure. [116]

Planar lung scan results are frequently classified according to the
criteria established in the PIOPED study. [117] These criteria were the
subject of debate and have been revised. [118][,][119] To facilitate communication with clinicians, a three-tier classification is preferable: normal
scan (excluding PE), high-probability scan (considered diagnostic of
PE in most patients), and non-diagnostic scan. [120][�][122] Prospective
clinical outcome studies suggested that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with a normal perfusion scan. This was confirmed by a randomized trial comparing the V/Q scan with CTPA. [122]

An analysis from the PIOPED II study suggested that a highprobability V/Q scan could confirm PE, although other sources suggest that the positive predictive value of a high-probability lung scan is
not sufficient to confirm PE in patients with a low clinical
probability. [123][,][124]

Performing only a perfusion scan might be acceptable in patients
with a normal chest X-ray; any perfusion defect in this situation
would be considered a mismatch. The high frequency of nondiagnostic scans is a limitation because they indicate the necessity for
further diagnostic testing. Various strategies to overcome this problem have been proposed, notably the incorporation of clinical probability. Although the use of perfusion scanning and chest X-ray with
the Prospective Investigative Study of Acute Pulmonary Embolism
Diagnosis (PISAPED) criteria may be associated with a low rate of
inconclusive results, the sensitivity appears too low to exclude PE
and thus this approach may be less safe than CTPA. [123][,][125]

Several studies suggest that data acquisition in single-photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging, with or without low-dose CT, may
decrease the proportion of non-diagnostic scans to as low as
0�5%. [121][,][126][�][128] However, most studies reporting on the accuracy
of SPECT are limited by their retrospective design [129][,][130] or the inclusion of SPECT itself in the reference standard, [127] and only one study
used a validated diagnostic algorithm. [131] The diagnostic criteria for
SPECT also varied; most studies defined PE as one or two subsegmental perfusion defects without ventilation defects, but these criteria are infrequently used in clinical practice. In addition, the optimal
scanning technique (perfusion SPECT, V/Q SPECT, perfusion SPECT
with non-enhanced CT, or V/Q SPECT with non-enhanced CT)
remains to be defined. Finally, few outcome studies are available, and
with incomplete follow-up. [132] Large-scale prospective studies are
needed to validate SPECT techniques.

The major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues
related to the use of V/Q scan and V/Q SPECT in the diagnosis of PE

are summarized in Table 6.

4.7 Pulmonary angiography
For several decades, pulmonary angiography was the ‘gold standard’
for the diagnosis or exclusion of acute PE, but it is now rarely performed as less-invasive CTPA offers similar diagnostic accuracy. [133]

The diagnosis of acute PE is based on direct evidence of a thrombus in
two projections, either as a filling defect or as amputation of a pulmonary arterial branch. [134] Thrombi as small as 1�2 mm within the subsegmental arteries can be visualized by digital subtraction angiography,
but there is substantial interobserver variability at this level. [135][,][136]

Pulmonary angiography is not free of risk. In a study of 1111



complications occurred in 1%, and minor complications in 5%. [137]

The majority of deaths occurred in patients with haemodynamic
compromise or respiratory failure. The amount of contrast agent
should be reduced and non-selective injections avoided in patients
with haemodynamic compromise. [138]

The major strengths, weaknesses/limitations, and radiation issues
related to the use of pulmonary angiography in the diagnosis of PE

are summarized in Table 6.

4.8 Magnetic resonance angiography
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been evaluated for several years regarding suspected PE. However, the results of large-scale
studies [139][,][140] show that this technique, although promising, is not yet
ready for clinical practice due to its low sensitivity, the high proportion of inconclusive MRA scans, and its low availability in most emergency settings. The hypothesis that a negative MRA, combined with
the absence of proximal DVT on compression ultrasonography
(CUS), may safely rule out clinically significant PE is currently being
investigated in an ongoing multicentre outcome study

[Clinicaltrials.gov National Clinical Trial (NCT) number 02059551].

4.9 Echocardiography
Acute PE may lead to RV pressure overload and dysfunction, which
can be detected by echocardiography. Given the peculiar geometry
of the RV, there is no individual echocardiographic parameter that
provides fast and reliable information on RV size or function. This is
why echocardiographic criteria for the diagnosis of PE have differed
between studies. Because of the reported negative predictive value
of 40�50%, a negative result cannot exclude PE. [124][,][142][,][143] On the
other hand, signs of RV overload or dysfunction may also be found in
the absence of acute PE, and may be due to concomitant cardiac or
respiratory disease. [144]

Echocardiographic findings of RV overload and/or dysfunction are
graphically presented in Figure 3. RV dilation is found in >_25% of
patients with PE on transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and is useful for risk stratification of the disease. [145] More specific echocardiographic findings were reported to retain a high positive predictive
value for PE even in the presence of pre-existing cardiorespiratory
disease. Thus, the combination of a pulmonary ejection acceleration
time (measured in the RV outflow tract) <60 ms with a peak systolic
tricuspid valve gradient <60 mmHg (‘60/60’ sign), or with depressed
contractility of the RV free wall compared to the ‘echocardiographic’
RV apex (McConnell sign), is suggestive of PE. [146] However, these
findings are present in only �12 and 20% of unselected PE patients,
respectively. [145] Detection of echocardiographic signs of RV pressure
overload helps to distinguish acute PE from RV free wall hypokinesia
or akinesia due to RV infarction, which may mimic the McConnell
sign. [147] It should be noted that in �10% of PE patients, echocardiography can show potentially misleading incidental findings such as significant LV systolic dysfunction or valvular heart disease. [145]

Decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) may
also be present in PE patients. [148][,][149] Echocardiographic parameters
of RV function derived from Doppler tissue imaging and wall strain
assessment may also be affected by the presence of acute PE
(Figure 3). However, they probably have low sensitivity as stand-alone
findings, as they were reported to be normal in haemodynamically
stable patients despite the presence of PE. [150][,][151]


Planar lung scan results are frequently classified according to the
criteria established in the PIOPED study. [117] These criteria were the
subject of debate and have been revised. [118][,][119] To facilitate communication with clinicians, a three-tier classification is preferable: normal
scan (excluding PE), high-probability scan (considered diagnostic of
PE in most patients), and non-diagnostic scan. [120][�][122] Prospective
clinical outcome studies suggested that it is safe to withhold anticoagulant therapy in patients with a normal perfusion scan. This was confirmed by a randomized trial comparing the V/Q scan with CTPA. [122]

An analysis from the PIOPED II study suggested that a highprobability V/Q scan could confirm PE, although other sources suggest that the positive predictive value of a high-probability lung scan is
not sufficient to confirm PE in patients with a low clinical
probability. [123][,][124]

Performing only a perfusion scan might be acceptable in patients
with a normal chest X-ray; any perfusion defect in this situation
would be considered a mismatch. The high frequency of nondiagnostic scans is a limitation because they indicate the necessity for
further diagnostic testing. Various strategies to overcome this problem have been proposed, notably the incorporation of clinical probability. Although the use of perfusion scanning and chest X-ray with
the Prospective Investigative Study of Acute Pulmonary Embolism
Diagnosis (PISAPED) criteria may be associated with a low rate of
inconclusive results, the sensitivity appears too low to exclude PE
and thus this approach may be less safe than CTPA. [123][,][125]

Several studies suggest that data acquisition in single-photon emission CT (SPECT) imaging, with or without low-dose CT, may
decrease the proportion of non-diagnostic scans to as low as
0�5%. [121][,][126][�][128] However, most studies reporting on the accuracy
of SPECT are limited by their retrospective design [129][,][130] or the inclusion of SPECT itself in the reference standard, [127] and only one study

SPECT also varied; most studies defined PE as one or two subsegmental perfusion defects without ventilation defects, but these criteria are infrequently used in clinical practice. In addition, the optimal

with non-enhanced CT, or V/Q SPECT with non-enhanced CT)
remains to be defined. Finally, few outcome studies are available, and
with incomplete follow-up. [132] Large-scale prospective studies are
needed to validate SPECT techniques.

patients, procedure-related mortality was 0.5%, major non-fatal

Echocardiographic examination is not mandatory as part of the
routine diagnostic workup in haemodynamically stable patients with
suspected PE, [124] although it may be useful in the differential diagnosis
of acute dyspnoea. This is in contrast to suspected high-risk PE, in
which the absence of echocardiographic signs of RV overload or dysfunction practically excludes PE as the cause of haemodynamic instability. In the latter case, echocardiography may be of further help in
the differential diagnosis of the cause of shock, by detecting pericardial tamponade, acute valvular dysfunction, severe global or regional
LV dysfunction, aortic dissection, or hypovolaemia. [152] Conversely, in
a haemodynamically compromised patient with suspected PE,
unequivocal signs of RV pressure overload, especially with more specific echocardiographic findings (60/60 sign, McConnell sign, or rightheart thrombi), justify emergency reperfusion treatment for PE if
immediate CT angiography is not feasible in a patient with high clinical
probability and no other obvious causes for RV pressure
overload. [152]

Mobile right-heart thrombi are detected by TTE or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), or by CT angiography, in <4% of unselected patients with PE. [153][�][155] Their prevalence may reach 18% among
PE patients in the intensive care setting. [156] Mobile right-heart thrombi
essentially confirm the diagnosis of PE and are associated with high early
mortality, especially in patients with RV dysfunction. [155][,][157][�][159]

In some patients with suspected acute PE, echocardiography may
detect increased RV wall thickness or tricuspid insufficiency jet velocity beyond values compatible with acute RV pressure overload (>3.8


cases, chronic thromboembolic (or other) pulmonary hypertension
(PH) should be included in the differential diagnosis.

4.10 Compression ultrasonography
In the majority of cases, PE originates from DVT in a lower limb, and only
rarely from upper-limb DVT (mostly following venous catheterization).
In a study using venography, DVT was found in 70% of patients with proven PE. [161] Nowadays, lower-limb CUS has largely replaced venography
for diagnosing DVT. CUS has a sensitivity >90% and a specificity of
�95% for proximal symptomatic DVT. [162][,][163] CUS shows a DVT in
30�50% of patients with PE, [162][�][164] and finding a proximal DVT in
patients suspected of having PE is considered sufficient to warrant anticoagulant treatment without further testing. [165] However, patients in whom
PE is indirectly confirmed by the presence of a proximal DVT should
undergo risk assessment for PE severity and the risk of early death.

In the setting of suspected PE, CUS can be limited to a simple fourpoint examination (bilateral groin and popliteal fossa). The only validated diagnostic criterion for DVT is incomplete compressibility of the
vein, which indicates the presence of a clot, whereas flow measurements are unreliable. A positive proximal CUS result has a high positive
predictive value for PE. The high diagnostic specificity (96%) along with
a low sensitivity (41%) of CUS in this setting was shown by a recent
meta-analysis. [165][,][166] CUS is a useful procedure in the diagnostic strategy of patients with CT contraindications. The probability of a positive
proximal CUS in suspected PE is higher in patients with signs and symptoms related to the leg veins than in asymptomatic patients. [162][,][163]

Moreover, using CT venography is associated with increased radiation doses. [168]
### 5 Assessment of pulmonary embolism severity and the risk of early death

Risk stratification of patients with acute PE is mandatory for determining the appropriate therapeutic management approach. As

described in section 3.3, initial risk stratification is based on clinical

symptoms and signs of haemodynamic instability (Table 4), which indicate a high risk of early death. In the large remaining group of patients
with PE who present without haemodynamic instability, further
(advanced) risk stratification requires the assessment of two sets of
prognostic criteria: (i) clinical, imaging, and laboratory indicators of
PE severity, mostly related to the presence of RV dysfunction; and (ii)
presence of comorbidity and any other aggravating conditions that



5.1 Clinical parameters of pulmonary
embolism severity
Acute RV failure, defined as a rapidly progressive syndrome with systemic congestion resulting from impaired RV filling and/or reduced
RV flow output, [68] is a critical determinant of outcome in acute PE.
Tachycardia, low systolic BP, respiratory insufficiency (tachypnoea
and/or low SaO 2 ), and syncope, alone or in combination, have been
associated with an unfavourable short-term prognosis in acute PE.

5.2 Imaging of right ventricular size and
function

5.2.1 Echocardiography
Echocardiographic parameters used to stratify the early risk of
patients with PE are graphically presented in Figure 3, and their prog[nostic values are summarized in Supplementary Data Table 3. Of](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)

these, an RV/LV diameter ratio >_1.0 and a TAPSE <16 mm are the

findings for which an association with unfavourable prognosis has
most frequently been reported. [148]

Overall, evidence for RV dysfunction on echocardiography is
found in >_25% of unselected patients with acute PE. [145]

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have suggested that RV
dysfunction on echocardiography is associated with an elevated
risk of short-term mortality in patients who appear haemodynamically stable at presentation, [180][,][181] but its overall positive
predictive value for PE-related death was low (<10%) in a metaanalysis. [180] This weakness is partly related to the fact that echocardiographic parameters have proved difficult to standardize. [148][,][180] Nevertheless, echocardiographic assessment of the
morphology and function of the RV is widely recognized as a valuable tool for the prognostic assessment of normotensive
patients with acute PE in clinical practice.

In addition to RV dysfunction, echocardiography can identify rightto-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale and the presence of
right heart thrombi, both of which are associated with increased

chamber views of the heart by CT angiography can detect RV
enlargement (RV end-diastolic diameter and RV/LV ratio measured in the transverse or four-chamber view) as an indicator of
RV dysfunction. The prognostic value of an enlarged RV is supported by the results of a prospective multicentre cohort study
in 457 patients. [184] In that study, RV enlargement (defined as an
RV/LV ratio >_0.9) was an independent predictor of an adverse inhospital outcome, both in the overall population with PE [hazard

�
ratio (HR) 3.5, 95% CI 1.6 7.7] and in haemodynamically stable

�
patients (HR 3.8, 95% CI 1.3 10.9). [184] A meta-analysis of 49
studies investigating >13 000 patients with PE confirmed that an

increased RV/LV ratio of >_1.0 on CT was associated with a 2.5
fold increased risk for all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) 2.5,
95% CI 1.8�3.5], and with a five-fold risk for PE-related mortality

�
(OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.7 9.2). [185]

Mild RV dilation (RV/LV slightly above 0.9) on CT is a frequent
finding (>50% of haemodynamically stable PE patients [186] ), but it
probably has minor prognostic significance. However, increasing RV/
LV diameter ratios are associated with rising prognostic specificity, [187][,][188] even in patients considered to be at ‘low’ risk on the basis
of clinical criteria. [186] Thus, RV/LV ratios >_ 1.0 (instead of 0.9) on CT
angiography may be more appropriate to indicate poor prognosis.

Apart from RV size and the RV/LV ratio, CT may provide further
prognostic information based on volumetric analysis of the heart
chambers [189][�][191] and assessment of contrast reflux to the inferior
vena cava (IVC). [185][,][192][,][193]

5.3 Laboratory biomarkers
5.3.1 Markers of myocardial injury
Elevated plasma troponin concentrations on admission may be associated with a worse prognosis in the acute phase of PE. Cardiac troponin

I or T elevation are defined as concentrations above the normal limits,

and thresholds depend on the assay used; an overview of the cut-off values has been provided by a meta-analysis. [194] Of patients with acute PE,
between 30 (using conventional assays) [194][,][195] and 60% (using highsensitivity assays) [196][,][197] have elevated cardiac troponin I or T concentrations. A meta-analysis showed that elevated troponin concentrations
were associated with an increased risk of mortality, both in unselected

�
patients (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.3 8.4) and in those who were haemody
�
namically stable at presentation (OR 5.9, 95% CI 2.7 13.0). [195]

On their own, increased circulating levels of cardiac troponins
have relatively low specificity and positive predictive value for
early mortality in normotensive patients with acute PE. However,
when interpreted in combination with clinical and imaging findings,
they may improve the identification of an elevated PE-related risk
and the further prognostic stratification of such patients
[(Supplementary Data Table 4). At the other end of the severity](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
spectrum, high-sensitivity troponin assays possess a high negative



prospective multicentre cohort of 526 normotensive patients,
high-sensitivity troponin T concentrations <14 pg/mL had a negative predictive value of 98% for excluding an adverse in-hospital
clinical outcome. [63] Age-adjusted high-sensitivity troponin T cutoff values (>_14 pg/mL for patients aged <75 years and >_45 pg/mL
for those >_75 years) may further improve the negative predictive
value of this biomarker. [196]

Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), an early and sensitive marker of myocardial injury, provides prognostic information in
acute PE, both in unselected [198][,][199] and normotensive patients. [200][,][201]

In a meta-analysis investigating 1680 patients with PE, H-FABP concentrations >_6 ng/mL were associated with an adverse short-term

�
outcome (OR 17.7, 95% CI 6.0 51.9) and all-cause mortality (OR

�
32.9, 95% CI 8.8 123.2). [202]

5.3.2 Markers of right ventricular dysfunction
RV pressure overload due to acute PE is associated with increased
myocardial stretch, which leads to the release of B-type natriuretic
peptide (BNP) and N-terminal (NT)-proBNP. Thus, the plasma levels
of natriuretic peptides reflect the severity of RV dysfunction and haemodynamic compromise in acute PE. [203] A meta-analysis found that
51% of 1132 unselected patients with acute PE had elevated BNP or
NT-proBNP concentrations on admission; these patients had a 10%

� �
risk of early death (95% CI 8.0 13%) and a 23% (95% CI 20 26%)
risk of an adverse clinical outcome. [204]

Similar to cardiac troponins (see above), elevated BNP or NTproBNP concentrations possess low specificity and positive predictive value (for early mortality) in normotensive patients with PE, [205]

but low levels of BNP or NT-proBNP are capable of excluding an
unfavourable early clinical outcome, with high sensitivity and a negative predictive value. [180] In this regard, an NT-proBNP cut-off value
<500 pg/mL was used to select patients for home treatment in a multicentre management study. [206] If emphasis is placed on increasing the
prognostic specificity for an adverse early outcome, higher cut-off values >_600 pg/mL might be more appropriate. [207]

5.3.3 Other laboratory biomarkers
Lactate is a marker of imbalance between tissue oxygen supply and
demand, and consequently of severe PE with overt or imminent haemodynamic compromise. Elevated arterial plasma levels >_2 mmol/L
predict PE-related complications, both in unselected [208] and in initially
normotensive [209][,][210] PE patients.

Elevated serum creatinine levels and a decreased (calculated) glomerular filtration rate are related to 30 day all-cause mortality in acute
PE. [211] Elevated neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and cystatin
C, both indicating acute kidney injury, are also of prognostic value. [212]

A recent meta-analysis investigating 18 616 patients with acute PE
found that hyponatraemia predicted in-hospital mortality (OR 5.6,
95% CI 3.4�9.1). [213]

Vasopressin is released upon endogenous stress, hypotension, and
low CO. Its surrogate marker, copeptin, has been reported to be
useful for risk stratification of patients with acute PE. [214][,][215] In a singlecentre derivation study investigating 268 normotensive PE patients,
copeptin levels >_24 pmol/L were associated with a 5.4-fold (95% CI
1.7�17.6) increased risk of an adverse outcome. [216] These results

spectrum, high-sensitivity troponin assays possess a high negative
predictive value in the setting of acute PE. [197] For example, in a

were confirmed in 843 normotensive PE patients prospectively
included in three European cohorts. [217]

5.4 Combined parameters and scores for
assessment of pulmonary embolism
severity
In patients who present without haemodynamic instability, individual
baseline findings may not suffice to determine and further classify PE
severity and PE-related early risk when used as stand-alone parameters. As a result, various combinations of the clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters described above have been used to build
prognostic scores, which permit a (semi)quantitative assessment of
early PE-related risk of death. Of these, the Bova [218][�][221] and the HFABP (or high-sensitivity troponin T), Syncope, Tachycardia (FAST)
scores [219][,][222][,][223] have been validated in cohort studies (see
[Supplementary Data Table 4). However, their implications for patient](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
management remain unclear. To date, only a combination of RV dysfunction on an echocardiogram (or CTPA) with a positive cardiac
troponin test has directly been tested as a guide for early therapeutic
decisions (anticoagulation plus reperfusion treatment vs. anticoagulation alone) in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PE patients
presenting without haemodynamic instability. [224]

5.5 Integration of aggravating conditions
and comorbidity into risk assessment of
acute pulmonary embolism
In addition to the clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings, which are
directly linked to PE severity and PE-related early death, baseline
parameters related to aggravating conditions and comorbidity are
necessary to assess a patient’s overall mortality risk and early outcome. Of the clinical scores integrating PE severity and comorbidity,
the Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) (Table 7) is the one
that has been most extensively validated to date. [225][�][228] The principal
strength of the PESI lies in the reliable identification of patients at low
risk for 30 day mortality (PESI classes I and II). One randomized trial
employed a low PESI as the principal inclusion criterion for home
treatment of acute PE. [178]

In view of the complexity of the original PESI, which includes 11 differently weighed variables, a simplified version (sPESI; Table 7) has
been developed and validated. [229][�][231] As with the original version of
the PESI, the strength of the sPESI lies in the reliable identification of
patients at low risk for 30 day mortality. The prognostic performance

of the sPESI has been confirmed in observational cohort studies, [227][,][228] although this index has not yet been prospectively used to
guide therapeutic management of low-risk PE patients.

The diagnosis of concomitant DVT has been identified as an
adverse prognostic factor, being independently associated with death
within the first 3 months after acute PE. [232] In a meta-analysis investigating 8859 patients with PE, the presence of concomitant DVT was
confirmed as a predictor of 30 day all-cause mortality (OR 1.9, 95%
CI 1.5�2.4), although it did not predict PE-related adverse outcomes
at 90 days. [233] Thus, concomitant DVT can be regarded as an indicator of significant comorbidity in acute PE.

5.6 Prognostic assessment strategy
The classification of PE severity and the risk of early (in-hospital or 30

begins upon suspicion of the disease and initiation of the diagnostic
workup. At this early stage, it is critical to identify patients with (suspected) high-risk PE. This clinical setting necessitates an emergency

caused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolaemia, or sepsis).

c Elevation of further laboratory biomarkers, such as NT-proBNP >_600 ng/L, H-FABP >_6 ng/mL, or copeptin >_24 pmol/L, may provide additional prognostic information. These
markers have been validated in cohort studies but they have not yet been used to guide treatment decisions in randomized controlled trials.
d Haemodynamic instability, combined with PE confirmation on CTPA and/or evidence of RV dysfunction on TTE, is sufficient to classify a patient into the high-risk PE category.
In these cases, neither calculation of the PESI nor measurement of troponins or other cardiac biomarkers is necessary.
e Signs of RV dysfunction on TTE (or CTPA) or elevated cardiac biomarker levels may be present, despite a calculated PESI of I�II or an sPESI of 0. 234 Until the implications of
such discrepancies for the management of PE are fully understood, these patients should be classified into the intermediate-risk category.


diagnostic algorithm (Figure 4) and immediate referral for reperfusion
treatment, as explained in section 7, and displayed in Figure 6 and
[Supplementary Data Figure 1. Testing for laboratory biomarkers such](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
as cardiac troponins or natriuretic peptides is not necessary for
immediate therapeutic decisions in patients with high-risk PE.
In the absence of haemodynamic instability at presentation, further
risk stratification of PE is recommended, as it has implications for
early discharge vs. hospitalization or monitoring of the patient
(explained in section 7). Table 8 provides an overview of the clinical,
imaging, and laboratory parameters used to distinguish intermediateand low-risk PE. The PESI is—in its original or simplified form—the
most extensively validated and most broadly used clinical score to
date, as it integrates baseline indicators of the severity of the acute PE
episode with aggravating conditions and the comorbidity of the

�
patient. Overall, a PESI of class I II or an sPESI of 0 is a reliable pre
dictor of low-risk PE.

In addition to clinical parameters, patients in the intermediate-risk
group who display evidence of both RV dysfunction (on echocardiography or CTPA) and elevated cardiac biomarker levels in the circulation (particularly a positive cardiac troponin test) are classified into
the intermediate-high-risk category. As will be discussed in more
detail in section 7, close monitoring is recommended in these cases to
permit the early detection of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, and consequently the need for rescue reperfusion therapy. [179]



CTPA, and/or who have normal cardiac biomarker levels, belong to
the intermediate-low-risk category. As an alternative approach, use
of further prognostic scores combining clinical, imaging, and laboratory parameters may be considered to semi-quantitatively assess the
severity of the PE episode, and distinguish intermediate-high-risk and
[intermediate-low-risk PE. Supplementary Data Table 4 lists the scores](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
most frequently investigated for this purpose in observational
(cohort) studies; however, none of them has been used in RCTs to

date.

A recent meta-analysis included 21 cohort studies with a total
of 3295 patients with ‘low-risk’ PE based on a PESI of I�II or an
sPESI of 0. [234] Overall, 34% (95% CI 30�39%) of them were
reported to have signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or
CTPA. Data on early mortality were provided in seven studies

�
(1597 patients) and revealed an OR of 4.19 (95% CI 1.39 12.58)
for death from any cause in the presence of RV dysfunction; elevated cardiac troponin levels were associated with a comparable
magnitude of risk elevation. [234] Early all-cause mortality rates
(1.8% for RV dysfunction and 3.8% for elevated troponin levels [234] ) were in the lower range of those previously reported for
patients with intermediate-risk PE. [235] Until the clinical implications of such discrepancies are clarified, patients with signs of RV
dysfunction or elevated cardiac biomarkers, despite a low PESI or

an sPESI of 0, should be classified into the intermediate-low-risk

category.

### 6 Treatment in the acute phase

6.1 Haemodynamic and respiratory
support
6.1.1 Oxygen therapy and ventilation
Hypoxaemia is one of the features of severe PE, and is mostly due to
the mismatch between ventilation and perfusion. Administration of
supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with PE and SaO 2 <90%.
Severe hypoxaemia/respiratory failure that is refractory to conventional oxygen supplementation could be explained by right-to-left
shunt through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. [67]

Further oxygenation techniques should also be considered, including
high-flow oxygen (i.e. a high-flow nasal cannula) [236][,][237] and mechanical
ventilation (non-invasive or invasive) in cases of extreme instability
(i.e. cardiac arrest), taking into consideration that correction of hypoxaemia will not be possible without simultaneous pulmonary
reperfusion.

Patients with RV failure are frequently hypotensive or are highly
susceptible to the development of severe hypotension during induction of anaesthesia, intubation, and positive-pressure ventilation.
Consequently, intubation should be performed only if the patient is
unable to tolerate or cope with non-invasive ventilation. When feasible, non-invasive ventilation or oxygenation through a high-flow nasal
cannula should be preferred; if mechanical ventilation is used, care
should be taken to limit its adverse haemodynamic effects. In particular, positive intrathoracic pressure induced by mechanical ventilation
may reduce venous return and worsen low CO due to RV failure in
patients with high-risk PE; therefore, positive end-expiratory pressure should be applied with caution. Tidal volumes of approximately
6 mL/kg lean body weight should be used in an attempt to keep the
end-inspiratory plateau pressure <30 cm H 2 O. If intubation is
needed, anaesthetic drugs more prone to cause hypotension should


6.1.2 Pharmacological treatment of acute right

ventricular failure

Acute RV failure with resulting low systemic output is the leading
cause of death in patients with high-risk PE. The principles of acute
right heart failure management have been reviewed in a statement
from the Heart Failure Association and the Working Group on
Pulmonary Circulation and Right Ventricular Function of the ESC. [68]

An overview of the current treatment options for acute RV failure is
provided in Table 9.

If the central venous pressure is low, modest (<_500 mL) fluid challenge can be used as it may increase the cardiac index in patients with
acute PE. [238] However, volume loading has the potential to overdistend the RV and ultimately cause a reduction in systemic CO. [239]

Experimental studies suggest that aggressive volume expansion is of
no benefit and may even worsen RV function. [240] Cautious volume
loading may be appropriate if low arterial pressure is combined with
an absence of elevated filling pressures. Assessment of central venous
pressure by ultrasound imaging of the IVC (a small and/or collapsible
IVC in the setting of acute high-risk PE indicates low volume status)
or, alternatively, by central venous pressure monitoring may help
guide volume loading. If signs of elevated central venous pressure are
observed, further volume loading should be withheld.

Use of vasopressors is often necessary, in parallel with (or while
waiting for) pharmacological, surgical, or interventional reperfusion
treatment. Norepinephrine can improve systemic haemodynamics
by bringing about an improvement in ventricular systolic interaction
and coronary perfusion, without causing a change in PVR. [240] Its use
should be limited to patients in cardiogenic shock. Based on the
results of a small series, the use of dobutamine may be considered
for patients with PE, a low cardiac index, and normal BP; however,
raising the cardiac index may aggravate the ventilation/perfusion mismatch by further redistributing flow from (partly) obstructed to
unobstructed vessels. [241] Although experimental data suggest that

levosimendan may restore RV pulmonary arterial coupling in acute
PE by combining pulmonary vasodilation with an increase in RV contractility, [242] no evidence of clinical benefit is available.

Vasodilators decrease PAP and PVR, but may worsen hypotension
and systemic hypoperfusion due to their lack of specificity for the pulmonary vasculature after systemic [intravenous (i.v.)] administration.
Although small clinical studies have suggested that inhalation of nitric
oxide may improve the haemodynamic status and gas exchange of
patients with PE, [243][�][245] no evidence for its clinical efficacy or safety is
available to date. [246]

6.1.3 Mechanical circulatory support and oxygenation
The temporary use of mechanical cardiopulmonary support, mostly
with veno�arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO), may be helpful in patients with high-risk PE, and circulatory
collapse or cardiac arrest. Survival of critically ill patients has been
described in a number of case series, [247][�][252] but no RCTs testing the
efficacy and safety of these devices in the setting of high-risk PE have
been conducted to date. Use of ECMO is associated with a high incidence of complications, even when used for short periods, and the
results depend on the experience of the centre as well as patient
selection. The increased risk of bleeding related to the need for vascular access should be considered, particularly in patients undergoing
thrombolysis. At present, the use of ECMO as a stand-alone technique with anticoagulation is controversial [247][,][252] and additional therapies, such as surgical embolectomy, have to be considered.

A few cases suggesting good outcomes with use of the Impella [V] R

catheter in patients in shock caused by acute PE have been
reported. [253][,][254]

6.1.4 Advanced life support in cardiac arrest
Acute PE is part of the differential diagnosis of cardiac arrest with



activity. In cardiac arrest presumably caused by acute PE, current
guidelines for advanced life support should be followed. [255][,][256] The
decision to treat for acute PE must be taken early, when a good outcome is still possible. Thrombolytic therapy should be considered;
once a thrombolytic drug is administered, cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be continued for at least 60�90 min before terminating
resuscitation attempts. [257]

6.2 Initial anticoagulation
6.2.1 Parenteral anticoagulation
In patients with high or intermediate clinical probability of PE (see section 4), anticoagulation should be initiated while awaiting the results
of diagnostic tests. This is usually done with subcutaneous, weightadjusted low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux
[(Supplementary Data Table 5), or i.v. unfractionated heparin (UFH).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
[Based on pharmacokinetic data (Supplementary Data Table 6),](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data) [259] an
equally rapid anticoagulant effect can also be achieved with a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), and phase III clinical
trials have demonstrated the non-inferior efficacy of a single-oral
drug anticoagulation strategy using higher doses of apixaban for 7
days or rivaroxaban for 3 weeks. [259][�][261]

LMWH and fondaparinux are preferred over UFH for initial
anticoagulation in PE, as they carry a lower risk of inducing major
bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. [262][�][265] Neither
LMWH nor fondaparinux need routine monitoring of anti-Xa levels. Use of UFH is nowadays largely restricted to patients with
overt haemodynamic instability or imminent haemodynamic
decompensation in whom primary reperfusion treatment will be
necessary. UFH is also recommended for patients with serious
renal impairment [creatinine clearance (CrCl) <_30 mL/min] or
severe obesity. If LMWH is prescribed in patients with CrCl
15 - 30 mL/min, an adapted dosing scheme should be used. The


Vasodilators decrease PAP and PVR, but may worsen hypotension
and systemic hypoperfusion due to their lack of specificity for the pulmonary vasculature after systemic [intravenous (i.v.)] administration.
Although small clinical studies have suggested that inhalation of nitric
oxide may improve the haemodynamic status and gas exchange of
patients with PE, [243][�][245] no evidence for its clinical efficacy or safety is
available to date. [246]

6.2.2 Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants
NOACs are small molecules that directly inhibit one activated coagulation factor, which is thrombin for dabigatran and factor Xa for apix
aban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The characteristics of NOACs

used in the treatment of acute PE are summarized in Supplementary
[Data Table 6. Owing to their predictable bioavailability and pharma-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
cokinetics, NOACs can be given at fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring. Compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs),
there are fewer interactions when NOACs are given concomitantly
with other drugs. [259] In the phase III VTE trials, the dosages of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban were not reduced in patients with
mild�moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl between 30�60 mL/min),
whereas edoxaban was given at a 30 mg dose in these patients.
Patients with CrCl <25 mL/min were excluded from the trials testing
apixaban, whereas patients with CrCl <30 mL/min were excluded
from those investigating rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran

months (see section 8), demonstrated the non-inferiority of NOACs
compared with the combination of LMWH with VKA for the prevention of symptomatic or lethal VTE recurrence, along with significantly
reduced rates of major bleeding. [267] The different drug regimens

occurred in 1.1% of NOAC-treated patients and 1.7% of VKA

Suggestions for the anticoagulation management of PE in specific
clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is lacking, are pre[sented in Supplementary Data Table 9.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
Practical guidance for clinicians regarding the handling of NOACs
and the management of emergency situations related to their use are
regularly updated by the European Heart Rhythm Association. [259]

6.2.3 Vitamin K antagonists
VKAs have been the gold standard in oral anticoagulation for more
than 50 years. When VKAs are used, anticoagulation with UFH,
LMWH, or fondaparinux should be continued in parallel with the
oral anticoagulant for >_5 days and until the international normalized

�
ratio (INR) value has been 2.0 3.0 for 2 consecutive days. Warfarin
may be started at a dose of 10 mg in younger (e.g. aged <60 years)
otherwise healthy patients and at a dose <_5 mg in older patients. [269]

The daily dose is adjusted according to the INR over the next 5�7

�
days, aiming for an INR level of 2.0 3.0. Pharmacogenetic testing
may increase the precision of warfarin dosing. [270][,][271] When used in



anticoagulation control and may be associated with a reduced risk of
bleeding, but does not reduce the risk of thromboembolic events or
mortality. [272]

The implementation of a structured anticoagulant service (most
commonly, anticoagulant clinics) appears to be associated with
increased time in the therapeutic range and improved clinical outcome, compared with control of anticoagulation by the general practitioner. [273][,][274] Finally, in patients who are selected and appropriately
trained, self-monitoring of VKA is associated with fewer thromboembolic events and increased time in the therapeutic range compared with usual care. [275]

6.3 Reperfusion treatment
6.3.1 Systemic thrombolysis
Thrombolytic therapy leads to faster improvements in pulmonary
obstruction, PAP, and PVR in patients with PE, compared with UFH
alone; these improvements are accompanied by a reduction in RV
dilation on echocardiography. [276][�][279] The greatest benefit is
observed when treatment is initiated within 48 h of symptom onset,
but thrombolysis can still be useful in patients who have had symptoms for 6�14 days. [280] Unsuccessful thrombolysis, as judged by persistent clinical instability and unchanged RV dysfunction on
echocardiography after 36 h, has been reported in 8% of high-risk PE
patients. [281]

A meta-analysis of thrombolysis trials that included (but were not
confined to) patients with high-risk PE, defined mainly as the presence
of cardiogenic shock, indicated a significant reduction in the combined outcome of mortality and recurrent PE (Supplementary Data
[Table 10). This was achieved with a 9.9% rate of severe bleeding and](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
a 1.7% rate of intracranial haemorrhage. [282]

In normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE, defined as the
presence of RV dysfunction and elevated troponin levels, the impact
of thrombolytic treatment was investigated in the Pulmonary
Embolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) trial. [179] Thrombolytic therapy
was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of haemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but this was paralleled by an
increased risk of severe extracranial and intracranial bleeding. [179] In
the PEITHO trial, 30 day death rates were low in both treatment
groups, although meta-analyses have suggested a reduction in PE
�
related and overall mortality of as much as 50 60% following thrombolytic treatment in the intermediate-risk category (Supplementary
[Data Table 10).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data) [282][,][283]

The approved regimens and doses of thrombolytic agents for PE,
as well as the contraindications to this type of treatment, are shown

in Table 10. Accelerated i.v. administration of recombinant tissue
type plasminogen activator (rtPA; 100 mg over 2 h) is preferable to
prolonged infusions of first-generation thrombolytic agents (streptokinase and urokinase). Preliminary reports on the efficacy and safety
of reduced-dose rtPA [284][,][285] need confirmation by solid evidence
before any recommendations can be made in this regard. UFH may
be administered during continuous infusion of alteplase, but should
be discontinued during infusion of streptokinase or urokinase. [65]

Reteplase, [286] desmoteplase, [287] or tenecteplase [179][,][278][,][279] have also
been investigated; at present, none of these agents are approved for

use in acute PE.

It remains unclear whether early thrombolysis for (intermediateor high-risk) acute PE has an impact on clinical symptoms, functional

limitation, or CTEPH at long-term follow-up. A small randomized
trial of 83 patients suggested that thrombolysis might improve functional capacity at 3 months compared with anticoagulation alone. [278]

In the PEITHO trial, [179] mild persisting symptoms, mainly dyspnoea,
were present in 33% of the patients at long-term (at 41.6 ± 15.7
months) clinical follow-up. [288] However, the majority of patients
(85% in the tenecteplase arm and 96% in the placebo arm) had a low
or intermediate probability—based on the ESC Guidelines definition [289] —of persisting or new-onset PH at echocardiographic followup. [288] Consequently, the findings of this study do not support a role
for thrombolysis with the aim of preventing long-term sequelae (section 10) after intermediate-risk PE, although they are limited by the
fact that clinical follow-up was available for only 62% of the study
population.

6.3.2 Percutaneous catheter-directed treatment

Mechanical reperfusion is based on the insertion of a catheter into
the pulmonary arteries via the femoral route. Different types of cath[eters (summarized in Supplementary Data Table 11) are used for](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
mechanical fragmentation, thrombus aspiration, or more commonly
a pharmacomechanical approach combining mechanical or ultrasound fragmentation of the thrombus with in situ reduced-dose
thrombolysis.
Most knowledge about catheter-based embolectomy is derived
from registries and pooled results from case series. [290][,][291] The
overall procedural success rates (defined as haemodynamic stabilization, correction of hypoxia, and survival to hospital discharge)
of percutaneous catheter-based therapies reported in these studies have reached 87%; [292] however, these results may be subject to



treatment and a catheter-based therapy combining ultrasoundbased clot fragmentation with low-dose in situ thrombolysis in 59
patients with intermediate-risk PE. In that study, ultrasoundassisted thrombolysis was associated with a larger decrease in the

RV/LV diameter ratio at 24 h, without an increased risk of bleeding. [293] Data from two prospective cohort studies [294][,][295] and a
registry, [296] with a total of 352 patients, support the improvement
in RV function, lung perfusion, and PAP in patients with intermediate- or high-risk PE using this technique. Intracranial haemorrhage
was rare, although the rate of Global Utilization of Streptokinase
and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary
Arteries (GUSTO) severe and moderate bleeding complications
was 10% in one of these cohorts. [294] These results should be inter
preted with caution, considering the relatively small numbers of
patients treated, the lack of studies directly comparing catheterdirected with systemic thrombolytic therapy, and the lack of data
from RCTs on clinical efficacy outcomes.

6.3.3 Surgical embolectomy
Surgical embolectomy in acute PE is usually carried out with cardiopulmonary bypass, without aortic cross-clamping and cardioplegic cardiac arrest, followed by incision of the two main
pulmonary arteries with the removal or suction of fresh clots.
Recent reports have indicated favourable surgical results in high
risk PE, with or without cardiac arrest, and in selected cases of
intermediate-risk PE. [297][�][300] Among 174 322 patients hospitalized between 1999 and 2013 with a diagnosis of PE in New York
state, survival and recurrence rates were compared between
patients who underwent thrombolysis (n = 1854) or surgical
embolectomy (n = 257) as first-line therapy. [297] Overall, there


In the PEITHO trial, [179] mild persisting symptoms, mainly dyspnoea,
were present in 33% of the patients at long-term (at 41.6 ± 15.7

(85% in the tenecteplase arm and 96% in the placebo arm) had a low

publication bias. One RCT compared conventional heparin-based

568 ESC Guidelines


was no difference between the two types of reperfusion treatment regarding 30 day mortality (15 and 13%, respectively), but
thrombolysis was associated with a higher risk of stroke and reintervention at 30 days. No difference was found in terms of 5
year actuarial survival, but thrombolytic therapy was associated
with a higher rate of recurrent PE requiring readmission compared
with surgery (7.9 vs. 2.8%). However, the two treatments were not
randomly allocated in this observational retrospective study, and the
patients referred for surgery may have been selected. An analysis of
the Society of Thoracic Surgery Database with multicentre data collection, including 214 patients submitted for surgical embolectomy for
high- (n = 38) or intermediate-risk (n = 176) PE, revealed an in-hospital
mortality rate of 12%, with the worst outcome (32%) in the group
experiencing pre-operative cardiac arrest. [299]

Recent experience appears to support combining ECMO with
surgical embolectomy, particularly in patients with high-risk PE
with or without the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Among patients who presented with intermediate-risk PE (n =
28), high-risk PE without cardiac arrest (n = 18), and PE with cardiac arrest (n = 9), the in-hospital and 1 year survival rates were
93 and 91%, respectively. [300]

The concept of multidisciplinary rapid-response teams for the man


filter was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of
recurrent PE and a significant increase in the risk of DVT, without
a significant difference in the risk of recurrent VTE or death. [303][,][304]

The PREPIC-2 trial randomized 399 patients with PE and venous
thrombosis to receive anticoagulant treatment, with or without a
retrievable vena cava filter. In this study, the rate of recurrent VTE
was low in both groups and did not differ between groups. [302] A
systematic review and meta-analysis of published reports on the
efficacy and safety of vena cava filters included 11 studies, with a
total of 2055 patients who received a filter vs. 2149 controls. [305]

Vena cava filter placement was associated with a 50% decrease in

the incidence of PE and an �70% increase in the risk of DVT over

time. Neither all-cause mortality nor PE-related mortality differed
between patients with or without filter placement.

The broad indication for placement of a venous filter in patients with
recent (<1 month) proximal DVT and an absolute contraindication to
anticoagulant treatment is based mainly on the perceived high risk of
recurrent PE in this setting, and the lack of other treatment options.
Complications associated with vena cava filters are common and
can be serious. A systematic literature review revealed penetration
of the venous wall in 1699 (19%) of 9002 procedures; of these cases,
19% showed adjacent organ involvement and >_8% were symptomatic. [306] Lethal complications were rare (only two cases), but 5% of
the patients required major interventions such as surgical removal of
the filter, endovascular stent placement or embolization, endovascu
6.6 Recommendations for acute-phase treatment of
high-risk pulmonary embolism [a]


Recent experience appears to support combining ECMO with
surgical embolectomy, particularly in patients with high-risk PE
with or without the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Among patients who presented with intermediate-risk PE (n =
28), high-risk PE without cardiac arrest (n = 18), and PE with cardiac arrest (n = 9), the in-hospital and 1 year survival rates were
93 and 91%, respectively. [300]


6.4 Multidisciplinary pulmonary
embolism teams

The concept of multidisciplinary rapid-response teams for the management of ‘severe’ (high-risk and selected cases of intermediaterisk) PE emerged in the USA, with increasing acceptance by the medical community and implementation in hospitals in Europe and worldwide. Set-up of PE response teams (PERTs) is encouraged, as they
address the needs of modern systems-based healthcare. [301] A PERT
brings together a team of specialists from different disciplines including, for example, cardiology, pulmonology, haematology, vascular
medicine, anaesthesiology/intensive care, cardiothoracic surgery, and
(interventional) radiology. The team convenes in real time (face-toface or via web conference) to enhance clinical decision-making. This
allows the formulation of a treatment plan and facilitates its immediate implementation. [301] The exact composition and operating mode
of a PERT are not fixed, depending on the resources and expertise
available in each hospital for the management of acute PE.






6.5 Vena cava filters

The aim of vena cava interruption is to mechanically prevent venous
clots from reaching the pulmonary circulation. Most devices in current use are inserted percutaneously and can be retrieved after several weeks or months, or left in place over the long-term, if needed.

Potential indications include VTE and absolute contraindication to

anticoagulant treatment, recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation, and primary prophylaxis in patients with a high risk of VTE.
Other potential indications for filter placement, including freefloating thrombi, have not been confirmed in patients without contraindications to therapeutic anticoagulation.
Only two phase III randomized trials have compared anticoagulation with or without vena cava interruption in patients with
proximal DVT, with or without associated PE. [302][�][304] In the

### 7 Integrated risk-adapted diagnosis and management


7.1 Diagnostic strategies
Various combinations of clinical assessments, plasma D-dimer measurements, and imaging tests have been proposed and validated for PE


diagnosis. These strategies have been tested in patients presenting
with suspected PE in the emergency department or during their hospital stay, [101][,][164][,][171][,][320] and more recently in the primary care setting. [111] Withholding of anticoagulation without adherence to
evidence-based diagnostic strategies was associated with a significant
increase in the number of VTE episodes and sudden cardiac death at
3 month follow-up. [12] The most straightforward diagnostic algorithms
for suspected PE—with and without haemodynamic instability—are
presented in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. However, it is recognized
that the diagnostic approach for suspected PE may vary, depending
on the availability of, and expertise in, specific tests in various hospitals and clinical settings.

The proposed diagnostic strategy for pregnant women with suspected acute PE is discussed in section 9.
b Two alternative classification schemes may be used for clinical probability assessment, i.e. a three-level scheme (clinical probability defined as low, intermediate, or high) or a two-level scheme (PE unlikely or PE likely). When using a moderately sensitive assay, D-dimer measurement should be restricted to
patients with low clinical probability or a PE-unlikely classification, while highly sensitive assays may also be used in patients with intermediate clinical probability of PE due to a higher sensitivity and negative predictive value. Note that plasma D-dimer measurement is of limited use in suspected PE occurring in
hospitalized patients.

d CTPA is considered diagnostic of PE if it shows PE at the segmental or more proximal level.

treatment.


The diagnostic strategy for suspected acute PE in pregnancy is dis
cussed in section 9.

7.1.1 Suspected pulmonary embolism with
haemodynamic instability
The proposed strategy is shown in Figure 4. The clinical probability is
usually high and the differential diagnosis includes cardiac tamponade, acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, acute valvular
dysfunction, and hypovolaemia. The most useful initial test in this situation is bedside TTE, which will yield evidence of acute RV dysfunction if acute PE is the cause of the patient’s haemodynamic
decompensation. In a highly unstable patient, echocardiographic evidence of RV dysfunction is sufficient to prompt immediate reperfusion without further testing. This decision may be strengthened by



the (rare) visualization of right heart thrombi. [155][,][157][,][321][,][322] Ancillary
bedside imaging tests include TOE, which may allow direct visualization of thrombi in the pulmonary artery and its main branches, especially in patients with RV dysfunction. TOE should be cautiously
performed in hypoxaemic patients. Moreover, bedside CUS can
detect proximal DVT. As soon as the patient is stabilized using supportive treatment, final confirmation of the diagnosis by CT angiography should be sought.

For unstable patients admitted directly to the catheterization laboratory with suspected acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary angiography may be considered as a diagnostic procedure after the acute
coronary syndrome has been excluded, provided that PE is a probable diagnostic alternative and particularly if percutaneous catheterdirected treatment is a therapeutic option.

572 ESC Guidelines


7.1.2 Suspected pulmonary embolism without
haemodynamic instability
7.1.2.1 Strategy based on computed tomographic pulmonary
angiography
The proposed strategy based on CTPA is shown in Figure 5. In patients
admitted to the emergency department, measurement of plasma Ddimer is the logical first step following the assessment of clinical probability and allows PE to be ruled out in �30% of outpatients. D-dimer
should not be measured in patients with a high clinical probability of
PE, owing to a low negative predictive value in this population. [323] It is
also less useful in hospitalized patients because the number that needs
to be tested to obtain a clinically relevant negative result is high.

In most centres, multidetector CTPA is the second-line test in

patients with an elevated D-dimer level and the first-line test in
patients with a high clinical probability of PE. CTPA is considered to
be diagnostic of PE when it shows a clot at least at the segmental level
of the pulmonary arterial tree. False-negative results of CTPA have
been reported in patients with a high clinical probability of PE; [115]

however, such discrepancies are infrequent and the 3 month thromboembolic risk was low in these patients. [171] Accordingly, both the
necessity of performing further tests and the nature of these tests

remain controversial in these clinical situations.

7.1.2.2 Strategy based on ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy
In hospitals in which V/Q scintigraphy is readily available, it is a valid
option for patients with an elevated D-dimer and a contraindication to
CTPA. Also, V/Q scintigraphy may be preferred over CTPA to avoid
unnecessary radiation, particularly in younger patients and in female
patients in whom thoracic CT might raise the lifetime risk of breast
cancer. [324] V/Q lung scintigraphy is diagnostic (with either normal- or
high-probability findings) in �30�50% of emergency ward patients
with suspected PE. [75][,][122][,][134][,][325] The proportion of diagnostic V/Q scans
is higher in patients with a normal chest X-ray, and this might support
the use of a V/Q scan as a first-line imaging test for PE in younger
patients, depending on local availability. [326] The number of patients with
inconclusive findings may further be reduced by taking into account
clinical probability. Thus, patients with a non-diagnostic lung scan and
low clinical probability of PE have a low prevalence of confirmed
PE, [124][,][325] and the negative predictive value of this combination is further increased by the absence of a DVT on lower-limb CUS. If a highprobability lung scan is obtained from a patient with low clinical probability of PE, confirmation by other tests should be considered.

7.2 Treatment strategies
7.2.1 Emergency treatment of high-risk pulmonary

embolism

The algorithm for a risk-adjusted therapeutic approach to acute PE is
shown in Figure 6; an emergency management algorithm specifically for
patients with suspected acute high-risk PE is proposed in Supplementary
[Data Figure 1. Primary reperfusion treatment, in most cases systemic](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE.
Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed
treatment are alternative reperfusion options in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis, if expertise with either of these methods and
the appropriate resources are available on-site.
Following reperfusion treatment and haemodynamic stabilization,



parenteral to oral anticoagulation. As patients belonging to this risk
category were excluded from the phase III NOAC trials, the optimal
time point for this transition has not been determined by existing evidence but should instead be based on clinical judgement. The specifications concerning the higher initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban
(for 1 and 3 weeks after PE diagnosis, respectively), or the minimum
overall period (5 days) of heparin anticoagulation before switching to
dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed (see Supplementary Data
[Table 8 for tested and approved regimens).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)

7.2.2 Treatment of intermediate-risk pulmonary

embolism

For most cases of acute PE without haemodynamic compromise,
parenteral or oral anticoagulation (without reperfusion techniques)
is adequate treatment. As shown in Figure 6, normotensive patients
with at least one indicator of elevated PE-related risk, or with aggravating conditions or comorbidity, should be hospitalized. In this
group, patients with signs of RV dysfunction on echocardiography or
CTPA (graphically presented in Figure 3), accompanied by a positive
troponin test, should be monitored over the first hours or days due
to the risk of early haemodynamic decompensation and circulatory
collapse. [179] Routine primary reperfusion treatment, notably full-dose
systemic thrombolysis, is not recommended, as the risk of potentially
life-threatening bleeding complications appears too high for the
expected benefits from this treatment. [179] Rescue thrombolytic therapy or, alternatively, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous
catheter-directed treatment should be reserved for patients who
develop signs of haemodynamic instability. In the PEITHO trial, the
mean time between randomization and death or haemodynamic
decompensation was 1.79 ± 1.60 days in the placebo (heparin-only)
arm. [179] Therefore, it appears reasonable to leave patients with intermediate-high-risk PE on LMWH anticoagulation over the first 2 - 3
days and ensure that they remain stable before switching to oral anticoagulation. As mentioned in the previous section, the specifications
concerning the increased initial dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban, or
the minimum overall period of heparin anticoagulation before switching to dabigatran or edoxaban, must be followed.

Suggestions for the anticoagulation and overall management of
acute PE in specific clinical situations, for which conclusive evidence is
[lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)

7.2.3 Management of low-risk pulmonary embolism: triage for early discharge and home treatment
As a general rule, early discharge of a patient with acute PE and continuation of anticoagulant treatment at home should be considered if
three sets of criteria are fulfilled: (i) the risk of early PE-related death
or serious complications is low (section 5); (ii) there is no serious
comorbidity or aggravating condition(s) (see section 5) that would
mandate hospitalization; and (iii) proper outpatient care and anticoagulant treatment can be provided, considering the patient’s (anticipated) compliance, and the possibilities offered by the healthcare
system and social infrastructure.
Randomized trials and prospective management cohort studies
that investigated the feasibility and safety of early discharge, and
home treatment, of PE adhered to these principles, even though


In most centres, multidetector CTPA is the second-line test in

patients with an elevated D-dimer level and the first-line test in
patients with a high clinical probability of PE. CTPA is considered to
be diagnostic of PE when it shows a clot at least at the segmental level
of the pulmonary arterial tree. False-negative results of CTPA have
been reported in patients with a high clinical probability of PE; [115]

however, such discrepancies are infrequent and the 3 month thromboembolic risk was low in these patients. [171] Accordingly, both the
necessity of performing further tests and the nature of these tests

remain controversial in these clinical situations.


7.1.2.2 Strategy based on ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy
In hospitals in which V/Q scintigraphy is readily available, it is a valid
option for patients with an elevated D-dimer and a contraindication to
CTPA. Also, V/Q scintigraphy may be preferred over CTPA to avoid
unnecessary radiation, particularly in younger patients and in female
patients in whom thoracic CT might raise the lifetime risk of breast
cancer. [324] V/Q lung scintigraphy is diagnostic (with either normal- or
high-probability findings) in �30�50% of emergency ward patients
with suspected PE. [75][,][122][,][134][,][325] The proportion of diagnostic V/Q scans
is higher in patients with a normal chest X-ray, and this might support
the use of a V/Q scan as a first-line imaging test for PE in younger
patients, depending on local availability. [326] The number of patients with
inconclusive findings may further be reduced by taking into account
clinical probability. Thus, patients with a non-diagnostic lung scan and
low clinical probability of PE have a low prevalence of confirmed
PE, [124][,][325] and the negative predictive value of this combination is further increased by the absence of a DVT on lower-limb CUS. If a highprobability lung scan is obtained from a patient with low clinical probability of PE, confirmation by other tests should be considered.


7.2 Treatment strategies
7.2.1 Emergency treatment of high-risk pulmonary

embolism

The algorithm for a risk-adjusted therapeutic approach to acute PE is
shown in Figure 6; an emergency management algorithm specifically for
patients with suspected acute high-risk PE is proposed in Supplementary

thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with high-risk PE.
Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed
treatment are alternative reperfusion options in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis, if expertise with either of these methods and
the appropriate resources are available on-site.
Following reperfusion treatment and haemodynamic stabilization,
patients recovering from high-risk PE can be switched from

slightly different criteria or combinations thereof were used to
ensure the above three requirements.
[The Hestia exclusion criteria (Supplementary Data Table 12)](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
represent a checklist of clinical parameters or questions that can
be obtained/answered at the bedside. They integrate aspects of
PE severity, comorbidity, and the feasibility of home treatment. If
the answer to one or more of the questions is ‘yes’, then the
patient cannot be discharged early. In a single-arm management

trial that used these criteria to select candidates for home treat
�
ment, the 3 month rate of recurrent VTE was 2.0% (0.8 4.3%) in
patients with acute PE who were discharged within 24 h. [317] In a
subsequent non-inferiority trial that randomized 550 patients to
direct discharge based on the Hestia criteria alone vs. additional
NT-proBNP testing and discharge if levels were <_500 pg/mL, the
primary outcome (30 day PE- or bleeding-related mortality, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or admission to an intensive care unit)
was very low in both arms. The results suggest no incremental
value of natriuretic-peptide testing in patients who are eligible for
home treatment based on the Hestia criteria, although the study
was not powered to exclude this possibility. [318]

The PESI and its simplified form, the sPESI (Table 7), also integrate
clinical parameters of PE severity and comorbidity to permit assessment of overall 30 day mortality. Compared with the Hestia criteria,
the PESI is more standardized, but it contains a less-comprehensive
list of aggravating conditions; moreover, the sPESI excludes all
patients with cancer from the low-risk category (compare Table 7
[with Supplementary Data Table 12). The PESI was not primarily](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
developed as a tool to select candidates for home treatment, but it
has been used—in combination with additional feasibility criteria—in
a trial of 344 patients randomized to inpatient vs. outpatient treatment of PE. [178] One (0.6%) patient in each treatment group died
within 90 days. [178]

In patients who were included in prospective cohort studies and
treated at home, with or without a short hospitalization period, the 3
month rates of thromboembolic recurrence, major bleeding, and
death were 1.75, 1.43, and 2.83%, respectively. [327]

In summary, the currently available evidence indicates that both
the Hestia rule and the PESI or sPESI appear capable of reliably identifying patients who are (i) at low PE-related risk, and (ii) free of serious
comorbidity. Consequently, either may be used for clinical triage
according to local experience and preference. If a PESI- or sPESIbased approach is chosen, it must be combined with assessment of
the feasibility of early discharge and home treatment; this assessment
is already integrated into the Hestia criteria.
A more difficult decision related to immediate or early discharge is whether the exclusion of intermediate-risk PE on clinical
grounds alone is adequate, or whether the assessment of RV dysfunction or myocardial injury (see section 5) by an imaging test or a
laboratory biomarker is necessary to provide maximal safety for
the patient in this ‘vulnerable’ early period. A systematic review
and meta-analysis of cohort studies suggested that the prognostic
sensitivity is increased further when clinical criteria (e.g. PESI or
sPESI) are combined with imaging findings, or laboratory biomarker levels. [234] A multicentre prospective management trial
tested this hypothesis, investigating the efficacy and safety of early
discharge, and ambulatory rivaroxaban treatment, in patients


Overall, �20% of the screened unselected patients with PE were
included. At the predefined interim analysis of 525 patients (50%
of the planned population), the 3 month rate of symptomatic or
fatal recurrent VTE was 0.6% (one-sided upper 99.6% CI 2.1%),
permitting the early rejection of the null hypothesis and termination of the trial. Major bleeding occurred in six (1.2%) of the
patients in the safety population. There were no PE-related
deaths. [319] In view of the existing evidence—and taking into consideration (i) the catastrophic scenario of early death if a patient
with acute PE is falsely judged to be at low risk on clinical grounds
alone and discharged ‘too early’ (as described in a prematurely
terminated trial [328] ), and (ii) the ease and minimal additional effort
of assessing RV size and function at presentation by echocardiography, or on the CTPA performed to diagnose the PE event
itself [329] (section 5)—it is wise to exclude RV dysfunction and right

�
heart thrombi if immediate or early (within the first 24 48 h) discharge of the patient is planned.
### 8 Chronic treatment and prevention of recurrence

The aim of anticoagulation after acute PE is to complete the treatment of the acute episode and prevent recurrence of VTE over
the long-term. Current drugs and regimens for the initial phase,
and the first months of anticoagulant treatment, are described

insection 6.

Most of the randomized studies focusing on long-term anticoagulation for VTE have included patients with DVT, with or without PE;
only two randomized studies have specifically focused on patients
with PE. [330][,][331] The incidence of recurrent VTE does not appear to
depend on the clinical manifestation of the first event (i.e. it is similar
after PE and after proximal DVT). However, in patients who have
had a PE, VTE more frequently recurs as PE, while in patients who
have had a DVT, it tends to recur more frequently as DVT. [332] As a
consequence, the case fatality rate of recurrent VTE in patients who
have previously had a PE is twice as high as that of VTE recurrence
after DVT. [333][,][334]

Landmark clinical trials have evaluated various durations of anticoagulant treatment with VKAs for VTE. [330][,][331][,][335][�][337] The findings of
these studies permit the following conclusions. First, all patients with
PE should receive >_3 months of anticoagulant treatment. Second,
after withdrawal of anticoagulant treatment, the risk of recurrence is
expected to be similar if anticoagulants are stopped after 3�6
months compared with longer treatment periods (e.g. 12�24
months). Third, extended oral anticoagulant treatment reduces the
risk for recurrent VTE by <_90%, but this benefit is partially offset by
the risk of bleeding.

Oral anticoagulants are highly effective in preventing recurrent
VTE during treatment, but they do not eliminate the risk of subsequent recurrence after the discontinuation of treatment. [330][,][331]

Based on this fact on the one hand, and considering the bleeding
risk of anticoagulation treatment on the other, the clinically
important question is how to best select candidates for extended
or indefinite anticoagulation. Involvement of the patient in the
decision-making process is crucial to optimize and maintain treat
ment adherence.

8.1 Assessment of venous

thromboembolism recurrence risk

The risk for recurrent VTE after discontinuation of treatment is

related to the features of the index PE (or, in the broader sense,
VTE) event. A study, which followed patients after a first episode of

acute PE, found that the recurrence rate after discontinuation of

treatment was �2.5% per year after PE associated with transient risk
factors, compared with 4.5% per year after PE occurring in the
absence of known cancer, known thrombophilia, or any transient risk
factor. [331] Similar observations were made in other prospective studies in patients with DVT. [337] Advancing the concept further, randomized anticoagulation trials over the past 15 years, which have focused
on secondary VTE prevention, have classified patients into distinct
groups based on their risk of VTE recurrence after discontinuation of
anticoagulant treatment. In general, these groups are: (i) patients in
whom a strong (major) transient or reversible risk factor, most commonly major surgery or trauma, can be identified as being responsible
for the acute (index) episode; (ii) patients in whom the index episode
might be partly explained by the presence of a weak (minor) transient
or reversible risk factor, or if a non-malignant risk factor for thrombosis persists; (iii) patients in whom the index episode occurred in the


absence of any identifiable risk factor (the present Guidelines avoid
terms such as ‘unprovoked’ or ‘idiopathic’ VTE); (iv) patients with one
or more previous episodes of VTE, and those with a major persistent
pro-thrombotic condition such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; and (v) patients with active cancer. [338]

Table 11 shows examples of transient/reversible and persistent
risk factors for VTE, classified by the risk of long-term recurrence.
As active cancer is a major risk factor for recurrence of VTE, but
also for bleeding while on anticoagulant treatment, [339] section 8.4 is
specifically dedicated to the management of PE in patients with

cancer.

Overall, assessment of the VTE recurrence risk after acute PE, in

the absence of a major transient or reversible risk factor, is a complex
issue. Beyond the examples listed in Table 11, patients who are carriers of some forms of hereditary thrombophilia, notably those with
confirmed deficiency of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S, and
patients with homozygous factor V Leiden or homozygous pro
thrombin G20210A mutation, are often candidates for indefinite anti
coagulant treatment after a first episode of PE occurring in the
absence of a major reversible risk factor. In view of these possible
implications, testing for thrombophilia (including antiphospholipid

576 ESC Guidelines


antibodies and lupus anticoagulant) [342] may be considered in patients
in whom VTE occurs at a young age (e.g. aged <50 years) and in the
absence of an otherwise identifiable risk factor, especially when this
occurs against the background of a strong family history of VTE. In
such cases, testing may help to tailor the regimen and dose of the
anticoagulant agent over the long-term. On the other hand, no evidence of a clinical benefit of extended anticoagulant treatment is currently available for carriers of heterozygous factor V Leiden or
prothrombin 20210A mutation.

A number of risk prediction models have been developed for the
assessment of the risk of recurrence in an individual patient
[(Supplementary Data Table 13).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data) [343][,][344] The clinical value and, in particular, the possible therapeutic implications of these models in the

NOAC era are unclear.

8.2 Anticoagulant-related bleeding risk

Incidence estimates from cohort studies conducted more than 15

years ago reported an �3% annual incidence of major bleeding in
patients treated with VKAs. [345] Meta-analyses of phase III studies
focusing on the first 3 - 12 months of anticoagulant treatment showed
an �40% reduction in the risk for major bleeding with NOACs compared with VKAs. [346] The risk of major bleeding is higher in the first
month of anticoagulant treatment, and then declines and remains stable over time. Based on currently available evidence, risk factors
include: (i) advanced age (particularly >75 years); (ii) previous bleeding (if not associated with a reversible or treatable cause) or anaemia;
(iii) active cancer; (iv) previous stroke, either haemorrhagic or ischaemic; (v) chronic renal or hepatic disease; (vi) concomitant antiplatelet
therapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (to be avoided, if
possible); (vii) other serious acute or chronic illness; and (viii) poor
anticoagulation control.

Existing bleeding risk scores and their current validation status
[are reviewed in Supplementary DataTable 14. The patient’s bleed-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
ing risk should be assessed, either by implicit judgement after evaluating individual risk factors or by the use of a bleeding risk score,
at the time of initiation of anticoagulant treatment. It should be
reassessed periodically (e.g. once a year in patients at low risk, and
every 3 or 6 months in patients at high risk for bleeding). Bleeding
risk assessment should be used to identify and treat modifiable
bleeding risk factors, and it may influence decision-making on the
duration and regimen/dose of anticoagulant treatment after acute

PE.

8.3 Regimens and treatment durations
with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, and with other non-vitamin K
antagonist antithrombotic drugs
All patients with PE should be treated with anticoagulants for >_3
months. [347] Beyond this period, the balance between the risk of
VTE recurrence and that of bleeding, which has been used to
select candidates for extended anticoagulation after a first VTE
event in the VKA era, is currently being revisited based on the
lower bleeding rates with NOACs. However, despite the



with NOACs is not without risk. Phase III clinical trials on the

extended treatment of VTE have shown that the rate of major
bleeding may be �1%, and that of clinically relevant non-major
(CRNM) bleeding as high as 6%. Bleeding rates may be higher in
everyday clinical practice. [348][,][349]

The NOAC trials that focused on extended VTE treatment are

[summarized in Supplementary Data Table 15. In all studies, patients](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
with PE made up approximately one-third of the entire study population, while the remaining two-thirds were patients with proximal
DVT but no clinically overt PE. Patients needed to have completed
the initial and long-term anticoagulation phase to be included in the

extended studies.

Dabigatran was compared with warfarin or placebo in two differ[ent studies (Supplementary Data Table 15).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data) [350] In these studies, dabigatran was non-inferior to warfarin for the prevention of confirmed
recurrent symptomatic VTE or VTE-related death, and more effective than placebo for the prevention of symptomatic recurrent VTE
or unexplained death. [350] The rate of major bleeding was 0.9% with
dabigatran compared to 1.8% with warfarin (HR 0.52, 95% CI
0.27�1.02). [350]

Rivaroxaban was compared with placebo or aspirin in two different studies in patients who had completed 6�12 months of anticoagulation treatment for a first VTE event (Supplementary Data
[Table 15). Treatment with rivaroxaban [20 mg once a day (o.d.)]](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
reduced recurrent VTE by �80%, with a 6.0% incidence of major or
CRNM bleeding as compared to 1.2% with placebo. [351] Rivaroxaban
given at a dose of 20 or 10 mg o.d. was compared with aspirin (100
mg o.d.) in 3365 patients. [352] Both doses of rivaroxaban reduced
symptomatic recurrent fatal or non-fatal VTE by �70% in comparison with aspirin. No significant differences in the rates of major or
CRNM bleeding were shown between either dose of rivaroxaban
and aspirin. [352]

Patients with VTE were randomized to receive two different doses

of apixaban [2.5 or 5 mg twice a day (bis in die: b.i.d.)] or placebo after
6�12 months of initial anticoagulation (Supplementary Data
[Table 15).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data) [353] Both doses of apixaban reduced the incidence of symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from any cause compared with placebo, with no safety concerns. [353]

Patients at high bleeding risk—based on the investigator’s judgement, the patient’s medical history, and the results of laboratory

examinations—were excluded from the extension studies men
tioned above; this was also the case for studies on extended anticoagulation with VKAs. [330][,][331] This fact should be taken into account
during triage of a patient for extended anticoagulation with one of
the above regimens.

In a randomized, open-label study in high-risk patients with
antiphospholipid syndrome (testing triple positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-b2-glycoprotein I), rivaroxaban

was associated with an increased rate of thromboembolic and

major bleeding events compared with warfarin (HR for the compo
�
site primary outcome 6.7; 95% CI 1.5 30.5). [354] At present, NOACs
are not an alternative to VKAs for patients with antiphospholipid
syndrome.

In two trials with a total of 1224 patients, extended therapy with
aspirin (after termination of standard oral anticoagulation) was

more recently, another trial demonstrated the superiority of anticoagulation with rivaroxaban, either 20 or 10 mg o.d., over aspirin for
secondary prophylaxis of VTE recurrence. [352]

of recurrence by �50% with no apparent increase in bleeding events.
However, only 8% of patients in this study had PE as the index VTE
event. [357]

8.5 Management of pulmonary embolism
in patients with cancer
Five RCTs compared LMWH vs. conventional VTE treatment (heparin followed by VKA) in the treatment of VTE in cancer-associated
thrombosis. [360][�][364] In 2003, a significant reduction in VTE recurrence
was reported with LMWH compared with conventional (VKA) treatment without an increase in bleeding complications. [362] In a more
recent trial, long-term administration of tinzaparin failed to achieve a
statistically significant reduction in overall VTE recurrence over con
�
ventional treatment (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41 1.03); however, the

overall rate of recurrent VTE in the control arm was lower than that

previously observed, probably as a result of the recruitment of
patients with a lower cancer-specific thrombotic risk. [360] Overall,
LMWHs were found to decrease the risk of recurrent VTE by 40%
with a risk of major bleeding complications similar to that of VKAs. [365]

Accordingly, LMWHs have become the standard of care. However,
these agents are associated with a relevant cost and burden for
patients. In addition, the absolute rate of recurrent VTE while on

�
LMWH remains high (7 9%) compared with that observed in non
�
cancer patients with VTE on conventional treatment (1.5 3%). [365]

NOACs could make the treatment of VTE easier and more con
venient in patients with cancer, due to their oral administration in
fixed-dose regimens and their lower cost compared with LMWH.

�
However, only 3 9% of patients included in phase III studies with

NOACs for the treatment of VTE had concomitant cancer. [260][,][261][,][312][,][314][,][351] A randomized, open-label trial compared edoxaban with LMWH in the secondary prevention of VTE in 1050
patients with cancer-associated thrombosis (mostly symptomatic or
asymptomatic PE). [366] Edoxaban (60 mg o.d., reduced to 30 mg in subjects with moderate renal impairment, low body weight, or concomitant need for strong inhibitors of glycoprotein-P) was started after 5
days of LMWH and treatment was given for >_6 months. Edoxaban
was non-inferior to dalteparin in the prevention of VTE recurrence
or major bleeding over 12 months after randomization (HR 0.97,
95% CI 0.70�1.36). Major bleeding occurred in 6.9% of the patients
in the edoxaban arm and 4.0% in the dalteparin arm (difference in risk

�
2.9 percentage points, 95% CI 0.1 5.6). This difference appears to
have been mainly accounted for by the high rate of bleeding in
patients with gastrointestinal cancer allocated to the edoxaban
group. [366] Similar results were reported by a randomized, open-label
pilot trial comparing rivaroxaban with dalteparin in 406 patients with
VTE and cancer, 58% of whom had metastases. [367] A significant

decrease in the risk of recurrent VTE was observed with rivaroxaban

�
(HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19 0.99). The 6 month cumulative rate of major

�
bleeding, which was mostly gastrointestinal, was 6% (95% CI 3 11%)

�
for rivaroxaban and 4% (95% CI 2 8%) for dalteparin (HR 1.83, 95%
CI 0.68�4.96). Corresponding rates of CRNM bleeds were 13%

� �
(95% CI 9 19%) and 4% (95% CI 2 9%), respectively (HR 3.76,
95% CI 1.63�8.69). [367]

Based on the currently available evidence, as described above,
patients with acute PE and cancer, particularly those with gastrointestinal cancer, should be encouraged to continue LMWH for >_ 3�6


severe renal impairment. In all other cases, especially in patients with
an anticipated low risk of bleeding and without gastrointestinal

tumours, the choice between LMWH and edoxaban or rivaroxaban

is left to the discretion of the physician, and the patient’s preference.
Owing to the high risk for recurrence, patients with cancer should
receive indefinite anticoagulation after a first episode of VTE.
Although existing evidence is limited, it is conceivable that once cancer is cured the risk for recurrence decreases and anticoagulation
can be stopped. However, the definition of cured cancer is not always

clear. The risk of recurrence of PE in cancer was assessed in a cohort

study of 543 patients and was validated in an independent set of 819
patients. [368] The proposed score to predict the risk of recurrence
included breast cancer (minus 1 point), Tumour Node Metastasis
stage I or II (minus 1 point), and female sex, lung cancer, and previous
VTE (plus 1 point each). Patients with a score <_0 were at low risk
(<_4.5%) and those with a score >_1 were at high (>_19%) risk of VTE
recurrence over the first 6 months. [368]

After the first 3�6 months, extended anticoagulation may consist
of continuation of LMWH or transition to an oral anticoagulant. Two
cohort studies have assessed the safety of extended treatment with
LMWH (<_12 months) in cancer-associated thrombosis. [369][,][370] In
both studies, the incidence of bleeding complications was higher in
the first months and then reached a plateau that remained unchanged

after the sixth month. In the absence of conclusive evidence, the deci
sion to continue with LMWH or to change to VKA or a NOAC
should be made on a case-by-case basis after consideration of the
success of anticancer therapy, the estimated risk of recurrence of
VTE, the bleeding risk, and the preference of the patient. Periodic
reassessment of the risk-to-benefit ratio of continued anticoagulant
treatment is mandatory.

As mentioned in section 5, venous filters are principally indicated
when anticoagulation is impossible due to active haemorrhage or an
excessive bleeding risk. However, the risk of VTE recurrence in the
absence of anticoagulation is particularly high in patients with cancer,
and the insertion of a filter should not delay the initiation of anticoagulation as soon as it is safe to do so. There is no evidence to support
the use of venous filters as an adjunct to anticoagulation treatment in
patients with cancer.
A number of studies have reported that a proportion of patients
presenting with PE in the absence of identifiable risk factors develop
cancer within the first year after diagnosis. [371] Consequently, the optimal strategy to achieve early diagnosis of these occult cancers was
investigated. Two large randomized trials failed to show that comprehensive CT of the abdomen or [18] F deoxy-fluoro-glucose positron
emission tomography were able to detect more cancers than limited
screening in patients with an unprovoked VTE. [372][,][373] Therefore,
based on current evidence, the search for occult cancer after an episode of VTE may be restricted to careful history taking, physical
examination, basic laboratory tests, and a chest X-ray (if no CTPA
was performed to diagnose PE). [372][,][374][,][375]

In patients with cancer, incidental PE should be managed in the
same manner as symptomatic PE, whether it involves segmental or
more proximal branches, multiple subsegmental vessels, or a single
subsegmental vessel in association with detectable DVT. [376][,][377]

thrombosis and thromboembolism were the most common

Diagnosis of PE during pregnancy can be challenging as symptoms



prevalence of confirmed PE is low among women investigated for
the disease, between 2 and 7%. [385][�][388] D-dimer levels continuously increase during pregnancy, [389][,][390] and levels are above the
threshold for VTE ‘rule-out’ in almost one-quarter of pregnant
women in the third trimester. [390] The results of a multinational

prospective management study of 441 pregnant women presenting to emergency departments with clinically suspected PE suggest that a diagnostic strategy�based on the assessment of
clinical probability, D-dimer measurement, CUS, and
CTPA�may safely exclude PE in pregnancy. [388] In that study, PE
exclusion on the basis of a negative D-dimer result (without
imaging) was possible in 11.7% of the 392 women with a non-high
pre-test probability (Geneva) score, a rate that was reduced to
4.2% in the third trimester. [388] A further prospective management
study evaluated a combination of a pregnancy-adapted YEARS
algorithm with D-dimer levels in 498 women with suspected PE
during pregnancy. PE was ruled out without CTPA in women
deemed to be at low PE risk according to the combination of the
algorithm and D-dimer results. At 3 months, only one woman
with PE excluded on the basis of the algorithm developed a popli
�
teal DVT (0.21%, 95% CI 0.04 1.2) and no women developed
PE. [391]

9.2.2 Imaging tests
A proposed algorithm for the investigation of suspected PE in
women who are pregnant, or <_6 weeks post-partum, is shown in
Figure 7. Both maternal and foetal radiation exposure are low
using modern imaging techniques (Table 12). [385][,][392][�][398] For V/Q

scans and CTPA, foetal radiation doses are well below the

threshold associated with foetal radiation complications (which
is 50�100 mSv). [399][,][400] In the past, CTPA has been reported to
cause high radiation exposure to the breast; [395][,][401] however, CT
technology has evolved, and several techniques can now reduce
radiation exposure without compromising image quality. These

pulmonary embolism in pregnancy

high-income countries. [379][,][380] For example, in the UK and Ireland,

thrombosis and thromboembolism were the most common

causes of direct maternal death (death resulting from the pregnancy rather than pre-existing conditions) in the triennium
2013�15, resulting in 1.13 mortalities per 100 000 maternities

A normal perfusion scan and a negative CTPA appear equally safe
for ruling out PE in pregnancy, as suggested by retrospective
series. [385][,][386][,][402][�][404] Inconclusive results can be a problem (4�33%
of investigations), [385][,][386][,][405] especially late in pregnancy. [405] A recent
survey of 24 sites in the UK, representing a population of 15.5 million,
revealed a similar rate of inadequate or indeterminate CTPA and
scintigraphy scans, suggesting that the initial choice of imaging is best
determined by local expertise and resources. [406]

V/Q SPECT is associated with low foetal and maternal radiation
exposure, and has promise in PE diagnosis in pregnancy. [407] However,

ESC Guidelines 581


anti-activated coagulation factor levels are lacking, and (iii) the assay
itself has limitations. [414] In addition, there are no solid data on the clin
ical benefit vs. harm of frequent, weight-based dose adjustments of
LMWH during pregnancy. Thus, anti-activated coagulation factor X
monitoring may be reserved for specific high-risk circumstances such
as recurrent VTE, renal impairment, and extremes of body weight.

The use of UFH has been associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bone loss. It remains uncertain whether, and to

what extent, the risk of bone loss is increased with LMWH use. In a

recent observational cohort study, in which bone mineral density

�
was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 4 7 years after
the last delivery in 152 women (92 of whom received prolonged
LMWH during pregnancy), lumbar spine bone mineral density was
similar in LWMH-treated women and controls following adjustment
for potential confounders. No osteoporosis or osteoporotic fractures were reported. [415]

Fondaparinux may be considered if there is an allergy or adverse
response to LMWH, although solid data are lacking and minor transplacental passage has been demonstrated. [416] VKAs cross the placenta
and are associated with a well-defined embryopathy during the first

trimester. Administration of VKAs in the third trimester can result in

foetal and neonatal haemorrhage, as well as placental abruption.
Warfarin may be associated with central nervous system anomalies
in the foetus throughout pregnancy. NOACs are contraindicated in
pregnant patients. [417]

The management of labour and delivery requires particular attention. In women receiving therapeutic LMWH, strong consideration
should be given to planned delivery in collaboration with the multidisciplinary team to avoid the risk of spontaneous labour while fully anticoagulated. The incidence of spinal haematoma after regional anaesthesia
is unknown in pregnant women under anticoagulation treatment. If
regional analgesia is considered for a woman receiving therapeutic
LMWH, >_24 h should have elapsed since the last LMWH dose before
insertion of a spinal or epidural needle (assuming normal renal function
and including risk assessment at extremes of body weight).
In high-risk situations, for example in patients with recent PE, it is
recommended that LMWH be converted to UFH >_36 h prior to
delivery. The UFH infusion should be stopped 4 - 6 h prior to anticipated delivery and the activated partial thromboplastin time should
be normal (i.e. not prolonged) prior to regional anaesthesia. [418]

Data are limited on the optimal timing of post-partum reinitiation
of LMWH. [419][,][420] Timing will depend upon the mode of delivery and
an assessment of the thrombotic vs. bleeding risk by a multidisciplinary team. LMWH should not be given for >_4 h after removal of the
epidural catheter; the decision on timing and dose should consider
whether the epidural insertion was traumatic, and take into account
the risk profile of the woman. For example, an interim dose of a prophylactic LMWH dose may be considered post-operatively (after
caesarean section), once at least 4 h have elapsed since epidural catheter removal, and allowing for an interval of >_8�12 h between the
prophylactic and the next therapeutic dose. Close collaboration
between the obstetrician, the anaesthesiologist, and the attending
physician is recommended.

Anticoagulant treatment should be administered for >_6 weeks
after delivery and with a minimum overall treatment duration of 3
months. LMWH and warfarin can be given to breastfeeding mothers;
the use of NOACs is not recommended. [417]

a In this section, absorbed radiation dose is expressed in mGy to reflect the radiation exposure to single organs, or the foetus, as a result of various diagnostic
techniques. Compare with Table 6, in which effective radiation dose is expressed
in millisieverts to reflect the effective doses of all organs that have been exposed.

further evaluation of this technique is required before its widespread
incorporation into diagnostic algorithms. For MRA, the long-term
effects of gadolinium contrast on the foetus are not known. In nonpregnant patients, technically inadequate images are frequently
obtained and the rate of inconclusive scan results is high. [140]

Therefore, use of this technique for diagnosing or ruling out PE during
pregnancy cannot be recommended at present. Conventional pulmonary angiography involves significantly higher radiation exposure

�
of the foetus (2.2 3.7 mSv) and should be avoided during
pregnancy. [400]

Overdiagnosis of PE is a potential pitfall that can have significant,
lifelong implications for a pregnant woman, including the risk of
bleeding at the time of delivery, the withholding of oestrogen contraception, and the requirement for thromboprophylaxis during future
pregnancies. Consequently, avoiding PE overdiagnosis in pregnancy is
as important as not missing a PE diagnosis.

9.3 Treatment of pulmonary embolism in

pregnancy
LMWH is the treatment of choice for PE during pregnancy. [384] In contrast to VKAs and NOACs, LMWH does not cross the placenta, and
consequently does not confer a risk of foetal haemorrhage or teratogenicity. Moreover, while UFH is also safe in pregnancy, LMWH has
more predictable pharmacokinetics and a more favourable risk
profile. [408][�][411] Although no RCT has evaluated the optimal dose of
LMWH for the treatment of PE during pregnancy, currently published data favour similar dosing to non-pregnant patients, either with
o.d. or b.i.d. regimens based on early pregnancy weight. [408][,][410] For the
majority of patients receiving LMWH treatment for PE during pregnancy, [412][,][413] it remains uncertain whether using serial measurements
of plasma anti-activated coagulation factor X activity to guide dosing
may be of clinical benefit. It is important to bear in mind that: (i)
LMWH has a predictable pharmacokinetic profile, (ii) data on optimal



582 ESC Guidelines


High-risk, life-threatening PE during pregnancy is a rare, but potentially devastating, event. A recent systematic review included 127
cases of severe PE during pregnancy (and until 6 weeks post-partum)
treated with thrombolysis, thrombectomy, and/or ECMO. [421] Both
high- and intermediate-risk PE cases were included, and 23% of
women experienced cardiac arrest. Reported survival rates were 94
and 86% following thrombolysis and surgical thrombectomy, respectively; however, these favourable rates may reflect reporting bias.
Following thrombolysis, major bleeding occurred in 18 and 58% of
cases during pregnancy and in the post-partum period, respectively. [421] Finally, foetal deaths occurred in 12 and 20% of the cases
following thrombolysis and thrombectomy, respectively. [421]

Thrombolytic treatment should not be used peri-partum, except in
the setting of life-threatening PE. Typically, UFH is used in the acute
treatment of high-risk PE.

Although the indications for vena cava filters are similar to those
for non-pregnant patients (discussed in section 6), there is limited
experience with their use in pregnancy and the risk associated with
the procedure may be increased.
Suggestions for the anticoagulation management of PE in specific
clinical situations (also) related to pregnancy, for which conclusive
[evidence is lacking, are presented in Supplementary Data Table 9.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)

9.3.1 Role of a multidisciplinary pregnancy heart team
A team of multidisciplinary colleagues should collaborate in the planning of ante-, peri-, and post-partum care pathways for women with
cardiovascular diseases, including PE. As many members as possible
of this team should have expertise in the management of PE during
pregnancy and the post-partum period. Jointly agreed, written care
pathways should be available (if timelines permit) for effective communication (an example is shown in Figure 7).

9.4 Amniotic fluid embolism

Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a rare condition that occurs during pregnancy or shortly after delivery. It remains one of the leading
causes of direct maternal death (i.e. death resulting from the pregnancy rather than from pre-existing conditions) in high-income
countries. [422] Diagnosis of AFE is challenging, being primarily a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. Awareness of AFE, prompt diagnosis, and
aggressive life support are of critical importance. AFE is characterized by unexplained sudden cardiovascular or respiratory deterioration, often accompanied by disseminated intravascular
coagulation, [422] and occurring during pregnancy or after delivery. [423][,][424] The reported incidence is approximately 2�7 per 100

�
000 maternities, with a mortality rate of 0.5 6 deaths per 100 000
deliveries. [422][,][425][,][426] Reported case fatality rates vary, reflecting the
challenges in making the diagnosis and the rarity of AFE. In a retrospective Californian study including more than 3.5 million deliveries,
a case fatality rate of 13% was reported, as in other US and
Canadian studies. [425] Similarly, a case fatality rate of 19% was
reported in a recent prospective UK population-based study with
validated case criteria. [422] Recent literature have suggested that risk
factors for AFE may include pre-existing cardiac, cerebrovascular,
and renal disorders, placenta previa, polyhydramnios, stillbirth, chorioamnionitis, hypertensive disorders, instrumental delivery, and
caesarean section. [422][,][425] Management of AFE is supportive, and

### 10 Long-term sequelae of pulmonary embolism

The patency of the pulmonary arterial bed is restored in the majority
of PE survivors within the first few months following the acute episode; therefore, no routine follow-up CTPA imaging is needed in
such patients treated for PE. [427] However, in other patients, thrombi
become persistent and organized, which in rare cases may result in
CTEPH, a potentially life-threatening obstructing vasculopathy. The
rarity of this condition is in contrast to the relatively large number of
patients who report persisting dyspnoea or poor physical perform
ance over several months after acute PE. Thus, the aims of an efficient

follow-up strategy after PE should be to: (i) provide appropriate care
(exercise rehabilitation, treatment of comorbidity, behavioural education, and modification of risk factors) to patients with persisting
symptoms, and (ii) ensure early detection of CTEPH to refer the
patient for further diagnostic workup and specific treatment.

10.1 Persisting symptoms and functional
limitation after pulmonary embolism
Cohort studies conducted over the past decade (summarized in Klok
et al. [428] ) have revealed that persisting or deteriorating dyspnoea, and
poor physical performance, are frequently present 6 months to 3
years after an acute PE episode. The proportion of patients claiming
that their health status is worse at 6 month follow-up than it was at
the time of PE diagnosis varies widely, ranging between 20 and
75%. [429][�][431] The following baseline parameters and findings could be
identified as predictors of exertional dyspnoea at long-term followup after PE: advanced age, cardiac or pulmonary comorbidity, higher
body mass index, and history of smoking; [429] higher systolic PAP and
RV dysfunction at diagnosis; [430][,][432][,][433] and residual pulmonary vascular
obstruction at discharge. [434]

More recently, a prospective cohort study enrolled 100 patients at
five Canadian hospitals between 2010 and 2013, and followed them
over 1 year. [435] As many as 47% of the patients had reduced maximal
aerobic capacity, defined as peak oxygen consumption <80% of the
predicted value on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). This
functional outcome was associated with significantly worse generic
health-related quality of life and dyspnoea scores, as well as with a significantly reduced 6 min walk distance. [435] Independent predictors of
reduced functional exercise capacity and quality of life over time
included female sex, higher body mass index, history of lung disease,
higher pulmonary artery systolic pressures on the 10 day echocardiogram, and higher main pulmonary artery diameter on the baseline
CTPA. [436] Of note, pulmonary function tests and echocardiographic
results at follow-up were largely within normal limits, both in patients
with and without reduced maximal aerobic capacity. [435] Lack of an
association between exercise impairment, and persistent RV dilation
or dysfunction, was also reported by a study of 20 survivors of massive or submassive PE. [437]

Taken together, older and more recent cohort studies have suggested that muscle deconditioning, particularly in the presence of
excess body weight and cardiopulmonary comorbidity, is largely
responsible for the frequently reported dyspnoea and signs of exer
cise limitation after acute PE. This also means that, at least in the



appear to be attributable to ‘large’ residual thrombi, or persisting/
progressive PH and RV dysfunction. Ongoing prospective studies in
large numbers of patients may help to better identify predictors of
functional and/or haemodynamic impairment after acute PE, and their
possible implications for shaping follow-up programmes. [438]

As mentioned in section 6, it remains unclear whether early reperfusion treatment, notably thrombolysis, has an impact on clinical
symptoms, functional limitation, or persistent (or new-onset) PH at
long-term follow-up after PE. Consequently, prevention of long-term
PE sequelae is, at present, no justification for thrombolytic treatment
in the acute phase of PE.

10.2 Chronic thromboembolic
pulmonary hypertension
10.2.1 Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and natural
history
CTEPH is a disease caused by the persistent obstruction of pulmonary arteries by organized thrombi, leading to flow redistribution and
secondary remodelling of the pulmonary microvascular bed. CTEPH
has been reported with a cumulative incidence of between 0.1 and
9.1% in the first 2 years after a symptomatic PE event; the large margin of error is due to referral bias, the paucity of early symptoms, and
the difficulty of differentiating acute PE from symptoms of preexisting CTEPH. [439][,][440] A prospective, multicentre, observational
screening survey for the detection of CTEPH included patients with

acute PE from 11 centres in Switzerland, from March 2009 to

November 2016. Screening for possible CTEPH was performed at 6,
12, and 24 months using a stepwise algorithm that included a phonebased dyspnoea survey, TTE, right heart catheterization, and radiological confirmation of CTEPH. Of 508 patients assessed for CTEPH
screening over 2 years, CTEPH incidence following PE was 3.7 per
1000 patient-years, with a 2 year cumulative incidence of 0.79%. [441] In
Germany, the incidence of CTEPH in 2016 was estimated at 5.7 per
million adult population. [442]

The hallmark of CTEPH is fibrotic transformation of a pulmonary
arterial thrombus, causing fixed mechanical obstruction of pulmonary arteries and leading to overflow of the open pulmonary arterial bed. Together with collateral supply from systemic arteries
downstream of pulmonary arterial occlusions, this contributes to
microvascular remodelling causing a progressive increase in
PVR. [443] Owing to this complex pathophysiology, there is no clear
correlation between the degree of mechanical obstruction found at
imaging and haemodynamics, which can deteriorate in the absence
of recurrent PE. [444]

Two historical trials assessed survival in patients with CTEPH
before the availability of surgical treatment. In both studies, mean
PAP >30 mmHg was related to poor survival, similar to that reported
for idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. [445][,][446]

The most frequently cited risk factors and predisposing conditions
for CTEPH are shown in Table 13. In an international registry, a history of acute PE was reported by 75% of patients. [447] Associated conditions and comorbidities included thrombophilic disorders,
particularly antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and high coagulation
factor VIII levels, cancer, a history of splenectomy, inflammatory

bowel disease, ventriculo-atrial shunts, and infection of chronic i.v.

lines and devices such as implantable pacemakers.


The patency of the pulmonary arterial bed is restored in the majority
of PE survivors within the first few months following the acute episode; therefore, no routine follow-up CTPA imaging is needed in
such patients treated for PE. [427] However, in other patients, thrombi
become persistent and organized, which in rare cases may result in
CTEPH, a potentially life-threatening obstructing vasculopathy. The
rarity of this condition is in contrast to the relatively large number of
patients who report persisting dyspnoea or poor physical perform
ance over several months after acute PE. Thus, the aims of an efficient

follow-up strategy after PE should be to: (i) provide appropriate care
(exercise rehabilitation, treatment of comorbidity, behavioural education, and modification of risk factors) to patients with persisting
symptoms, and (ii) ensure early detection of CTEPH to refer the
patient for further diagnostic workup and specific treatment.

10.2.2 Clinical presentation and diagnosis
Diagnosing CTEPH is difficult. Algorithms for predicting [450] or ruling
out CTEPH [451][,][452] are limited by a lack of specificity. The clinical characteristics of patients enrolled in an international CTEPH registry
have shown that the median age at diagnosis is 63 years and that both
sexes are equally affected; paediatric cases are rare. [447] Clinical symptoms and signs are non-specific or absent in early CTEPH, with signs
of right heart failure only becoming evident in advanced disease.
Thus, early diagnosis remains a challenge in CTEPH, with a median
time of 14 months between symptom onset and diagnosis in expert
centres. [453] When present, the clinical symptoms of CTEPH may
resemble those of acute PE or of pulmonary arterial hypertension; in
the latter context, oedema and haemoptysis occur more often in
CTEPH, while syncope is more common in pulmonary arterial
hypertension. [453]

The diagnosis of CTEPH is based on findings obtained after at least
3 months of effective anticoagulation, to distinguish this condition
from acute PE. The diagnosis requires a mean PAP of >_25 mmHg
along with a pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of <_15 mmHg, documented at right heart catheterization in a patient with mismatched
perfusion defects on V/Q lung scan. Specific diagnostic signs for
CTEPH on multidetector CT angiography or conventional pulmonary cineangiography include ring-like stenoses, webs, slits, and
chronic total occlusions. [289]

Some patients may present with normal pulmonary haemodynamics at rest despite symptomatic disease. If other causes of exercise
limitation are excluded, these patients are considered as having
chronic thromboembolic disease (CTED). Identification of patients
with chronic thromboembolism without PH, who may have an indication for surgical or interventional treatment, requires particular
expertise and should be done in CTEPH referral centres. Among
1019 patients who were submitted to pulmonary endarterectomy


hypertension at rest but showed functional improvement after the
operation. [454]

Planar V/Q lung scan is a suitable first-line imaging modality for
CTEPH as it has 96�97% sensitivity and 90�95% specificity for the
diagnosis. [455] SPECT seems less sensitive than planar V/Q scanning if
assessed at a level of individual segmental arteries, but it is unlikely to
miss clinically relevant CTEPH in an individual patient. In contrast to
CTEPH, abnormal mismatched perfusion defects sometimes found in
pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease typically have a non-segmental pattern.

CTPA is gaining ground as a diagnostic modality in CTEPH, [456] but
it should not be used as a stand-alone test to exclude the disease. [455]

Newer diagnostic tests include dual-energy CT, which allows the
simultaneous assessment of patency of the pulmonary arteries and of
lung perfusion, probably at a cost of some increase in radiation delivered to the patient. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pulmonary
vasculature is still considered inferior to CT. [457] Cone-beam CT, [458]

angioscopy, [459] intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence
tomography are more suitable for the characterization of lesions during interventional treatment than for diagnosis. High-resolution CT
scan of the chest may assist in the differential diagnosis of CTEPH,
showing emphysema, bronchial, or interstitial lung disease, as well as

infarcts, and vascular and thoracic wall malformations. Perfusion

inequalities manifesting as a mosaic parenchymal pattern are frequently found in CTEPH, but may also be observed in <_12% of
patients with other causes of PH. Differential diagnosis of CTEPH
should also include pulmonary arteritis, pulmonary angiosarcoma,
tumour embolism, parasites (hydatid cyst), foreign body embolism,
and congenital or acquired pulmonary artery stenoses. [289]

10.2.3 Surgical treatment
Surgical PEA is the treatment of choice for operable CTEPH. In contrast to surgical embolectomy for acute PE, treatment of CTEPH

ESC Guidelines 585


necessitates a true bilateral endarterectomy through the medial layer
of the pulmonary arteries. It requires deep hypothermia and intermittent circulatory arrest, without a need for cerebral perfusion. [460][,][461]

In-hospital mortality is currently as low as 4.7% [462] and is even lower
in high-volume single centres. [463] The majority of patients experience
substantial relief from symptoms and near-normalization of
haemodynamics. [461][�][464] Owing to the complexity of both the surgical
technique and peri-procedural management, PEA is performed in
specialized centres. Eligibility for surgery requires a decision taken
during a dedicated meeting of a multidisciplinary CTEPH team including experienced surgeons for PEA, interventional radiologists or cardiologists, radiologists experienced in pulmonary vascular imaging,
and clinicians with expertise in PH. The CTEPH team should confirm
the diagnosis, assess the surgical accessibility of chronic postthrombotic obstructions (‘surgical operability’), and consider the risks
related to comorbidities (‘medical operability’). The operability of
patients with CTEPH is determined by multiple factors that cannot
easily be standardized. These are related to the suitability of the
patient, the expertise of the surgical team, and available resources.
General criteria include pre-operative New York Heart Association
(NYHA) functional class and the surgical accessibility of thrombi in
the main, lobar, or segmental pulmonary arteries. [462] Advanced age
per se is no contraindication for surgery. There is no haemodynamic
threshold or measure of RV dysfunction that can be considered to
preclude PEA.

Data from the international CTEPH registry, set up in 27 centres
to evaluate the long-term outcome and outcome predictors in 679
operated and not-operated patients, showed estimated survival at 3
years of 89% in operated and 70% in not-operated patients. [465]

Mortality was associated with NYHA functional class, RA pressure,
and a history of cancer. [465] In this prospective registry, the long-term
prognosis of operated patients was better than the outcome of notoperated patients. [465] Additional correlates of mortality were bridging
therapy with pulmonary vasodilators, post-operative PH, surgical
complications, and additional cardiac procedures in operated
patients, and comorbidities such as coronary disease, left heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in not-operated
patients. [465] A recent report identified mean PAP >_38 mmHg and
PVR >_425 dyn - s - cm [-5] as determinants of poor prognosis in survivors
of surgical treatment for CTEPH. [466]

Post-operative ECMO is recommended as the standard of care in
PEA centres. [461] Early post-operative reperfusion oedema may
require veno-arterial ECMO, and severe persistent PH may be
bridged to emergency lung transplantation with ECMO. After PEA,
patients should be followed in CTEPH centres to exclude persistent
or recurrent PH, with at least one haemodynamic assessment to be

considered at 6�12 months after the intervention.

10.2.4 Balloon pulmonary angioplasty
Over the past decade, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) has
emerged as an effective treatment for technically inoperable CTEPH.
It allows dilatation of obstructions down to subsegmental vessels,
which are inaccessible to surgery. BPA is a stepwise procedure

�
requiring several (usually 4 10) separate sessions. This is necessary
to engage all under-perfused lung segments, while limiting the con


pulmonary arteries requires particular expertise, as the complexity
and individual variability of the pulmonary arterial tree greatly
exceeds that of other vascular beds. Complications include wire- and
balloon-induced injury, which may result in intrapulmonary bleeding,
haemoptysis, and reperfusion lung injury. Usually, bleeding resolves
spontaneously, but sometimes it has to be controlled by transient
balloon inflation proximal to the site of perforation; in rare cases it
requires embolization. Mild hypoxaemia is frequent and can be controlled by oxygen delivery. Mechanical ventilation or ECMO is rarely

needed.

The largest published registry to date included 249 patients with a
mean age of 61.5 years, who were treated with BPA between 2004
and 2013 in seven Japanese centres. [467] Mean PAP decreased from 43
to 24 mmHg after terminating BPA sessions, and this result was maintained in 196 patients who underwent follow-up right heart catheterization. Complications occurred in 36% of the patients, including
pulmonary injury (18%), haemoptysis (14%), and pulmonary artery
perforation (2.9%). After BPA, 30 day mortality was 2.6% and overall
survival was 97% at 1 year. [467]

While most of the BPA procedures are performed in technically
inoperable patients, this method has also been used for sequential
treatment for PH persisting after PEA. Few ‘rescue’ BPA interventions performed in unstable patients remaining on ECMO after PEA
were ineffective. [468]

10.2.5 Pharmacological treatment
Optimal medical treatment for CTEPH consists of anticoagulants, as
well as diuretics and oxygen in cases of heart failure or hypoxaemia.
Lifelong oral anticoagulation with VKAs is recommended, and also
after successful PEA or BPA. No data exist on the efficacy and safety

of NOACs.

Pulmonary microvascular disease in CTEPH has provided the
rationale for also testing drugs that have been approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension for this indication. Based on available data,
medical treatment of CTEPH with targeted therapy is now justified
for technically inoperable patients, [469][,][470] as well as for patients with
PH persisting after PEA. [469] To date, the only drug approved for inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent PH after PEA is riociguat, an
oral stimulator of soluble guanylate cyclase. [469] In a prospective
randomized trial of 261 patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent PH after PEA, treatment with riociguat significantly
increased 6 min walking distance and reduced PVR. [469] In a similar
population of 157 patients, the dual endothelin antagonist bosentan
showed a positive effect on haemodynamics, but no improvement
was observed in exercise capacity and the primary outcome was not
met. [471] Another dual endothelin antagonist, macitentan, was found
to significantly improve PVR and 6 min walking distance compared to
placebo in a phase II trial focusing on inoperable patients with
CTEPH. [470] Currently, riociguat is being tested in trials addressing its
efficacy and safety: (i) as bridging therapy for patients scheduled to
undergo PEA (NCT 03273257) and (ii) in comparison to BPA (NCT
02634203).

Overall, the effects on clinical worsening of drugs tested with
RCTs in patients with CTEPH have not yet been clarified.
Furthermore, no data exist on medical treatment in technically operable patients with prohibitive comorbidities or those refusing surgery.


In-hospital mortality is currently as low as 4.7% [462] and is even lower
in high-volume single centres. [463] The majority of patients experience
substantial relief from symptoms and near-normalization of
haemodynamics. [461][�][464] Owing to the complexity of both the surgical
technique and peri-procedural management, PEA is performed in
specialized centres. Eligibility for surgery requires a decision taken
during a dedicated meeting of a multidisciplinary CTEPH team including experienced surgeons for PEA, interventional radiologists or cardiologists, radiologists experienced in pulmonary vascular imaging,
and clinicians with expertise in PH. The CTEPH team should confirm
the diagnosis, assess the surgical accessibility of chronic postthrombotic obstructions (‘surgical operability’), and consider the risks
related to comorbidities (‘medical operability’). The operability of
patients with CTEPH is determined by multiple factors that cannot
easily be standardized. These are related to the suitability of the
patient, the expertise of the surgical team, and available resources.

(NYHA) functional class and the surgical accessibility of thrombi in
the main, lobar, or segmental pulmonary arteries. [462] Advanced age
per se is no contraindication for surgery. There is no haemodynamic
threshold or measure of RV dysfunction that can be considered to
preclude PEA.

to evaluate the long-term outcome and outcome predictors in 679
operated and not-operated patients, showed estimated survival at 3
years of 89% in operated and 70% in not-operated patients. [465]

Mortality was associated with NYHA functional class, RA pressure,
and a history of cancer. [465] In this prospective registry, the long-term
prognosis of operated patients was better than the outcome of notoperated patients. [465] Additional correlates of mortality were bridging

patients. [465] A recent report identified mean PAP >_38 mmHg and
PVR >_425 dyn - s - cm [-5] as determinants of poor prognosis in survivors
of surgical treatment for CTEPH. [466]

Post-operative ECMO is recommended as the standard of care in
PEA centres. [461] Early post-operative reperfusion oedema may
require veno-arterial ECMO, and severe persistent PH may be

10.3 Strategies for patient follow-up after
pulmonary embolism
Figure 8 displays a proposed follow-up strategy for survivors of acute
PE following discharge from hospital. Evaluation of the patients 3�6
months after the acute PE episode is recommended to assess the
persistence (or new onset) and severity of dyspnoea or functional
limitation, and to check for possible signs of VTE recurrence, cancer,

or bleeding complications of anticoagulation. The severity of dyspnoea can be assessed using the Medical Research Council scale; [160]

alternatively, the World Health Organization functional class can be
[determined (Supplementary Data Table 16).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data) [289]

In patients complaining of persisting dyspnoea and poor physical
performance, TTE should be considered as the next step to assess
the probability of (chronic) PH and thus possible CTEPH. The criteria and levels of PH probability are defined by current ESC
Guidelines, [289] [and are listed in Supplementary Data Tables 17 and](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
[18. Patients with a high echocardiographic probability of PH, or](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz405#supplementary-data)
those with intermediate probability combined with elevated NTproBNP levels or risk factors/predisposing conditions for CTEPH,
such as those listed in Table 13, should be considered for a V/Q

scan.

If mismatched perfusion defects are found on the V/Q scan,
referral to a PH or CTEPH expert centre for further diagnostic
workup is indicated. If, on the other hand, the V/Q scan is normal
and the patient’s symptoms remain unexplained, CPET may be
performed. By providing evidence of reduced maximal aerobic
capacity, CPET supports the need for further follow-up visits and
helps to identify candidates for pulmonary rehabilitation, exercise, or weight-reduction programmes. [435][,][436] CPET may also be
helpful in patients with suspected CTEPH and coexisting left
heart and/or respiratory disease; in such cases, it can help to
establish the main limiting factor and thus set priorities for the
treatment strategy. [472]

For patients who report as free of dyspnoea or functional limitation at 3�6-month follow-up after acute PE but have risk factors/predisposing conditions for CTEPH (Table 13), further follow-up visits
may be scheduled and the patient must be advised to return if symptoms appear. Alternatively, TTE may be considered to assess the
probability of PH (Figure 8).
Apart from the recommended screening and diagnostic measures,
an integrated model of patient care after PE should be provided, taking into consideration the infrastructure and possibilities offered by
each country’s health system. The model should include appropriately qualified nurses, interdisciplinary working with physicians in the
care of both in-hospital and ambulatory PE patients, standardized
treatment protocols adapted to the capacities of each hospital, and
bidirectional referral pathways between general practice and the hospital. Such models ensure smooth transitions between hospital specialists and practitioners; provide continuity, and easy access to care
along with information and education; and respect the patients’ pref
erences, and those of their families and social environment. In this

context, nurse-led care models to deliver follow-up have been
shown to be effective after acute coronary syndrome, [473] in primary
care-based management of chronic diseases, [474] and in community
based self-management initiatives. [475] A recently published study
investigated the care of 42 patients followed at a pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH)/CTEPH nurse-led outpatient clinic and showed
positive results. [476] During patient follow-up visits, appropriately
qualified nurses screen for signs and symptoms indicating VTE recurrence or complications of treatment, and assess adherence to medication. Nurses work collaboratively with patients using behavioural
frameworks and motivational interviewing, to identify and modify
associated risk factors (smoking cessation, diet, physical activity, and
exercise). In addition, they promote self-management skills such as

[on the EHJ and ESC websites (www.escardio.org/guidelines).](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
### 12 Key messages

The ESC Task Force has selected 10 simple key messages and rules
to guide physicians in the diagnosis and management of PE:

(1) In patients presenting with haemodynamic instability, perform bed
side TTE as a fast, immediate step to differentiate suspected high
risk PE from other acute life-threatening situations.

588 ESC Guidelines


(2) If you suspect acute PE, institute anticoagulation therapy as soon

as possible, while the diagnostic workup is ongoing, unless the

patient is bleeding or has absolute contraindications to this

therapy.

(3) Use recommended, validated diagnostic algorithms for PE, includ
ing standardized assessment of (pre-test) clinical probability and

D-dimer testing. They help to avoid unnecessary, expensive, and

potentially harmful imaging tests and exposure to ionizing

radiation.

(4) If the CTPA report suggests single subsegmental PE, consider

the possibility of a false-positive finding. Discuss the findings again

with the radiologist and/or seek a second opinion to avoid misdiag
nosis, and unnecessary, potentially harmful anticoagulation

treatment.

(5) Confirmation of PE in a patient, without haemodynamic instability,

must be followed by further risk assessment involving clinical find
ings, evaluation of the size and/or function of the RV, and labora
tory biomarkers as appropriate. This information will help you to

decide on the need for reperfusion treatment or monitoring for

patients at elevated risk, or consider the option of early discharge

and continuation of anticoagulation on an ambulatory basis for

patients at low risk.

(6) As soon as you diagnose (or strongly suspect) high-risk PE, select

the best reperfusion option (systemic thrombolysis, surgical

embolectomy, or catheter-directed treatment) considering the

patient’s risk profile, and the resources and expertise available at

your hospital. For patients with intermediate-high-risk PE, reperfu
sion is not first-line treatment, but you should prospectively plan

the management strategy with your team to have a contingency

plan ready if the situation deteriorates.

(7) Prefer anticoagulation with a NOAC over the ‘traditional’

LMWH-VKA regimen unless the patient has contraindication(s) to

this type of drug.

(8) Always remember that, with the exception of acute PE provoked

by a strong transient/reversible risk factor, there is a lifelong risk of

VTE recurrence after a first episode of PE. Consequently, re
examine the patient after the first 3 - 6 months of anticoagulation,

weigh the benefits vs. risks of continuing treatment, and decide on

the extension and dose of anticoagulant therapy, also considering

the patient’s preference. Remember to recommend regular

follow-up examinations, e.g. at yearly intervals.

(9) If you suspect PE in a pregnant patient, consider diagnostic path
ways and algorithms including CTPA or V/Q lung scan, which can

be used safely during pregnancy.

(10) After acute PE, patients should not be lost to follow-up. Apart

from checking for possible signs of VTE recurrence, cancer, or

bleeding complications of anticoagulation, ask the patient if there is

persisting or new-onset dyspnoea or functional limitation. If yes,

implement a staged diagnostic workup to exclude CTEPH or

chronic thromboembolic disease, and to detect/treat comorbidity

or ‘simple’ deconditioning. Follow-up imaging is not routinely rec
ommended in an asymptomatic patient, but it may be considered

in patients with risk factors for development of CTEPH.

### 13 Gaps in the evidence

Diagnosis

 - [The optimal method to adjust (based on the patient’s age or in]
combination with clinical probability) the D-dimer threshold, permitting the exclusion of PE while reducing the number of
unnecessary imaging tests to a minimum, remains to be
determined.

 - [The diagnostic value and clinical significance of isolated subseg-]
mental contrast-filling defects in the modern CTPA era remain
controversial.

 - [No robust data exist to guide the decision on whether to treat]
incidental PE with anticoagulants compared with a strategy of
watchful waiting.

 - [For patients presenting with non-traumatic chest pain, the bene-]
fits vs. risks of ‘triple rule-out’ (for coronary artery disease, PE,
and aortic dissection) CT angiography need further evaluation
before such an approach can be routinely recommended.

Assessment of pulmonary embolism severity and the risk
of early death

 - [The optimal, clinically most relevant combination (and cut-off lev-]
els) of clinical and biochemical predictors of early PE-related
death remain to be determined, particularly with regard to identifying possible candidates for reperfusion treatment among
patients with intermediate-risk PE.

 - [The need for assessment of the RV status in addition to clinical]
parameters, to classify a patient with acute symptomatic PE as
being at low vs. intermediate risk, needs to be confirmed by further prospective management (cohort) studies.

Treatment in the acute phase

 - [The clinical benefits vs. risks of reduced-dose thrombolysis and]
catheter-based reperfusion modalities in patients with intermediate-high-risk PE should be evaluated in prospective randomized
trials.

 - [The place of ECMO in the management of acute high-risk PE]
awaits support by additional evidence from prospective management (cohort) studies.

 - [The optimal anticoagulant drug(s) and regimen in patients with]
renal insufficiency and CrCl <30 mL/min remain unclear.

 - [The criteria for selecting patients for early discharge and]
outpatient treatment of PE, and particularly the need
for assessment of the RV status with imaging methods
and/or laboratory markers in addition to calculating a clinical
score, need to be further validated in prospective cohort
studies.

Chronic treatment and prevention of recurrence

 - [The clinical value and the possible therapeutic implications of]
models or scores assessing the risk of VTE recurrence, and the
risk of bleeding under anticoagulation, need to be revisited in the
NOAC era.

 - [The effectiveness of extended treatment with a reduced dose, or]
apixaban or rivaroxaban, should be confirmed in patients with a
high risk of recurrent PE.

ESC Guidelines 589



- [The evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of NOACs for]
the treatment of PE in patients with cancer needs to be
extended by further studies.

- [In patients with cancer, the anticoagulant regimen and dose after]
the first 6 months should be clarified and prospectively tested.

- [The optimal time for discontinuing anticoagulant treatment after]
an episode of acute PE in patients with cancer is yet to be
determined.

Pulmonary embolism and pregnancy

- [Diagnostic algorithms for PE in pregnancy, using modern radio-]
logical imaging techniques and low radiation doses, need to be
prospectively tested in adequately powered cohort studies.

- [Controversy persists on the optimal LMWH dose and regimen]
for the treatment of PE during pregnancy.

- [NOACs are not allowed in pregnancy. However, if exposure to]
these drugs occurs during pregnancy despite this warning, any


more precise information on the risks and complications of these
drugs, and adapt the instructions to physicians in the future.

Long-term sequelae of pulmonary embolism

 - [The optimal follow-up strategy, including the spectrum of diag-]
nostic tests that may be necessary, in patients with persisting
symptoms and functional limitation after acute PE needs to be
defined and prospectively validated.

 - [In the absence of persisting symptoms or functional limitation]
after acute PE, the criteria for identifying patients whose risk of
developing CTEPH may be sufficiently high to justify further diagnostic workup require further elaboration and validation in prospective cohort studies.
