### 1. Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management
strategies for an individual patient with a given condition.

Table 1 Classes of recommendations


Guidelines and their recommendations should facilitate decision

making of health professionals in their daily practice. However, guidelines are not a substitute for the patient’s relationship with their practitioner. The final decisions concerning an individual patient must be
made by the responsible health professional(s), based on what they
consider to be the most appropriate in the circumstances. These decisions are made in consultation with the patient and caregiver as

appropriate.
Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals. To ensure

that all users have access to the most recent recommendations, the

ESC makes its guidelines freely available. The ESC warns readers that
the technical language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the ESC. Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria
for the development of guidelines have been established to make all
decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website
[(https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines re-](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
present the official position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.
In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the
ESC carries out the EURObservational Research Programme of
international registries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions
that are essential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of
resources, and adherence to guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and
around the world, based on high-quality data collected during routine clinical practice.
Furthermore, the ESC develops sets of quality indicators (QIs),
which are tools to evaluate the level of implementation of the guidelines and may be used by the ESC, hospitals, healthcare providers,
and professionals to measure clinical practice, and in educational










4004 ESC Guidelines

Table 2 Levels of evidence

programmes, alongside the key messages from the guidelines, to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes.
The Members of this task force were selected by the ESC to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients
with this pathology. The selection procedure aimed to ensure that
there is a representative mix of members predominantly from across
the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty
Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion,
notably with respect to gender and country of origin. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. The level of evidence
and the strength of the recommendation of particular management
options were weighed and scored according to predefined scales, as
outlined below. The task force followed the ESC voting procedures.
All recommendations subject to a vote achieved at least 75% among
voting members.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of
interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest
[rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[Guidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
supplementary document simultaneously to the guidelines.
This process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in
the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of
interest that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC
and updated. The task force received its entire financial support from
the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG Committee supervises and coordinates the preparation of new guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the
approval process of these guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo
extensive review by the CPG Committee and external experts, including a mix of members from across the whole of the ESC region
and from relevant ESC Subspecialty Communities and National
Cardiac Societies. After appropriate revisions, the guidelines are
signed off by all the experts involved in the task force. The finalized
document is signed off by the CPG Committee for publication in the


European Heart Journal. The guidelines were developed after careful
consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their writing.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation
of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations, including condensed pocket guideline versions,
summary slides, summary cards for non-specialists, and an electronic
version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions
are abridged and thus, for more detailed information, the user
should always access the full-text version of the guidelines, which
is freely available via the ESC website and the European Heart
Journal. The National Cardiac Societies of the ESC are encouraged
to endorse, adopt, translate, and implement all ESC Guidelines.
Implementation programmes are needed because it has been shown
that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the
thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well
as in the determination and the implementation of preventive,
diagnostic, or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC
Guidelines do not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate
decisions in consideration of each patient‘s health condition and in
consultation with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each
country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription and, where
appropriate, to respect the ethical rules of their profession.
Off-label use of medication may be presented in this guideline if
sufficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically
appropriate to a given condition and if patients could benefit from
the recommended therapy. However, the final decisions concerning
an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional giving special consideration to:

(1) the specific situation of the patient. In this respect, it is specified
that, unless otherwise provided for by national regulations, off
ESC Guidelines 4005


label use of medication should be limited to situations where it is

in the patient’s interest to do so, with regard to the quality,
safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has been
informed and has provided consent;
(2) country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental
drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which health
professionals are subject, where applicable.
### 2. Introduction

This document presents an update of the 2015 ESC Guidelines
for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VA)
and the prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). New insights
into the epidemiology of SCD, new evidence on genetics, imaging,
and clinical findings for risk stratification for VA and SCD, and advances in diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic strategies made this
revision necessary. The committee was composed of 25 members
including 23 expert physicians, one methodologist, and one patient
representative. Experts were selected to cover all areas of VA and
SCD as well as subspecialties of cardiology with the assistance of related ESC working groups.
All 25 members of the task force committee approved the guideline recommendations after an anonymous voting process.
Ninety-nine peer reviewers reviewed the document. A systematic
literature survey was conducted, after instructions by the methodologist in the group, that led to the incorporation of 1155 references,
of which 485 were selected to support the recommendations and
[further specified in the table of evidence (Supplementary data).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac262#supplementary-data)

2.1. What is new

The diagnostic and management parts of the guidelines have been
adapted to facilitate their use in everyday clinical decision-making.
The first general part has new sections on diagnostic evaluation,
including pharmacologic provocative tests, genetic testing, and a systematic work-up of probands and relatives with primary electrical
diseases. Comprehensive flowcharts and recommendations for the
diagnostic evaluation at first presentation with a VA of patients without a previously known cardiac disease are provided for five frequently encountered clinical scenarios. Practical recommendations
for optimization of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) programming and algorithms for management of patients experiencing
regular wide complex tachycardia and electrical storm are presented
(Table 3).

ESC Guidelines 4011

### 3. Definitions

3.1. Ventricular arrhythmia subtypes
Premature ventricular complex (PVC): Premature occurrence of an abnormal QRS complex (duration typically ≥120 ms, corresponding
T-wave typically broad and in the opposite direction of the major
QRS deflection, no preceding P-wave).
Unifocal or monomorphic PVCs: PVCs with a single QRS morphology.
Multifocal, multiform, or polymorphic PVCs: PVCs with different QRS
morphologies.
Short-coupled PVC: A PVC that interrupts the T-wave of the preceding conducted beat.
Ventricular tachycardia (VT): ≥3 consecutive beats with a rate
.100 b.p.m. originating from the ventricles, independent from atrial
and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction.
Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT): Run of consecutive
ventricular beats persisting for 3 beats to 30 s.
Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (MVT): Same QRS morphology from beat to beat.
Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT): Continually changing QRS
morphology.
Sustained monomorphic/polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT/
SPVT): Continuous VT for at least 30 s, or which requires an interven
tion for termination.

Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia: Beat to beat alternation of the
frontal QRS axis (e.g. in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia [CPVT], Andersen–Tawil, digoxin toxicity, acute
myocarditis).
Torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (TdP): Subtype of a polymorphic VT in the context of QT prolongation with continually
changing QRS complexes that appear to spiral around the baseline
of the electrocardiogram (ECG) lead in a sinusoidal pattern.
Ventricular fibrillation (VF): A chaotic rhythm with undulations that
are irregular in timing and morphology, without discrete QRS complexes on the surface ECG.
Electrical storm: VA that occurs 3 or more times within 24 h (separated by at least 5 min), each requiring termination by an

intervention.

Incessant VT: Continuous sustained VT that recurs promptly despite repeated intervention for termination over several hours.

3.2. Sudden cardiac death

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA): Sudden cessation of normal cardiac activity with haemodynamic collapse.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD): Sudden natural death presumed to be
of cardiac cause that occurs within 1 h of onset of symptoms in witnessed cases, and within 24 h of last being seen alive when it is unwitnessed. SCD in autopsied cases is defined as the natural unexpected

death of unknown or cardiac cause.

Sudden unexplained death: Unexplained sudden death occurring in
an individual older than 1 year.
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS): Unexplained sudden death
occurring in an individual younger than 1 year with negative pathological and toxicological assessment and negative forensic examin
ation of the circumstances of death.


Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS): Unexplained sudden
death occurring in an individual older than 1 year with negative
pathological and toxicological assessment. Note: Synonymous with

‘ ’
autopsy-negative sudden unexplained death .

3.3. Syncope
Unexplained syncope: Transient loss of consciousness due to cerebral
hypoperfusion, characterized by a rapid onset, short duration, and
spontaneous complete recovery, but unexplained after conventional
workup. Work-up and differential diagnosis are provided in the 2018
ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope. [1]

Arrhythmic syncope: as above, but highly suspicious for intermittent
bradycardia, rapid supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), or VA.

3.4. Specialized centres
Multidisciplinary teams: A multidisciplinary team across specialties is
characterized by open communication, positive management and
leadership, appropriate resources, and a mix of skills.
Decision-making should be shared in the team.
Specialized centre for catheter ablation of VA: Patient and procedural
complexity vary widely. Some patients require a more experienced
operator and a centre with more capabilities, which is more likely
in patients with a non-ischaemic aetiology. A specialized centre has
at least one operator with appropriate experience in interventions
that may be required for a successful procedure (e.g. percutaneous
epicardial access). The centre performs catheter ablation of VT in
structural heart disease (SHD) on a regular basis. In addition, the centre has the required resources to manage medical conditions, comorbidities, and potential complications in patients undergoing
complex VA ablation; this includes interventional cardiology expertise, acute placement of mechanical circulatory assist devices, and cardiothoracic surgical back-up. Considering the variable availability
across European countries, it is preferable to treat complex patients
in the most experienced centre within reasonable distance.

3.5. Genetics

Pathogenic variant and likely pathogenic variant: The American College
of Medical Genetics has provided a framework for the interpretation
of disease causation by genetic variants standardized into classes. The
genetic variants most likely to cause an associated disease are termed
V, ‘pathogenic’, and IV, ‘likely pathogenic’.

Mutation: This term is used in this document to mean a Class IV or

V variant.

Variant of uncertain significance: A change in a gene’s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence that has an unknown effect on a per
son’s health.
### 4. Epidemiology of sudden cardiac death, public awareness, and risk stratification

4.1. Incidence of sudden cardiac death

SCD accounts for approximately 50% of all cardiovascular deaths,
with up to 50% being the first manifestation of cardiac disease. [19][–][24]

Ideally, cases suspicious of SCD should be identified from multiple

4012 ESC Guidelines


sources and undergo autopsy, which is required to reliably exclude
non-cardiac causes of sudden death (SD).
The incidence of SCD increases markedly with age. With a very
low incidence during infancy and childhood (1 per 100 000 personyears), [25][–][27] the incidence is approximately 50 per 100 000 personyears in middle-aged individuals (in the fifth to sixth decades of
life). [28][–][30] In the eighth decade of life, it reaches an annual incidence
of at least 200 per 100 000 person-years. [20] At any age, males have
higher SCD rates compared with females, even after adjustment
for risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD). [24][,][31][–][33] Ethnic
background also seems to have large effects. [34][,][35] It is estimated
that 10–20% of all deaths in Europe are SCD. [36][,][37] Approximately
300 000 people in Europe have out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
(OHCA) treated by emergency medical systems every year. [38][,][39]

In the Western world, the epidemiology of SCD is closely related
to CAD, which is responsible for up to 75–80% of SCD cases. [40]

While the prevalence of CAD has not decreased, there has been a
significant decline in mortality due to CAD. Reports show that the
incidence of SCD is declining, [40][–][42] but the risk of SCD as a proportion of the overall cardiovascular deaths may have increased. [43][,][44]

Although regular physical activity benefits cardiovascular health,
sport, particularly when practiced vigorously, has been shown to
be associated with SCD during or shortly after exercise in selected
populations. [45][–][51] Reports have suggested that the majority of sportsrelated SCD occurs in a recreational [52][,][53] rather than competitive
setting, especially among middle-aged male participants, suggesting
that CAD is the most common underlying cause. [46][,][54][,][55]

4.2. Causes of sudden cardiac death in
different age groups
Cardiac diseases associated with SCD vary depending on the individual’s age. In the young there is a predominance of primary electric
diseases and cardiomyopathies, as well as myocarditis, and coronary
anomalies. [25][,][27][,][56][–][61] However, half of SCD cases during the fourth
decade are related to CAD, especially acute coronary syndrome
(ACS). [62][,][63]

In older populations, chronic structural diseases predominate
(CAD either through acute coronary events or chronic coronary
stenoses, valvular heart diseases, and heart failure), while potentially
inherited electrical diseases or structural non-ischaemic diseases may
cause more than 50% of SCD in individuals under the age of 50
years. [27]

Age distribution at presentation with ventricular arrhythmias and
sudden cardiac death, dominant arrhythmia subtypes, triggers, genetic factors, and gender associated with increased risk for ventricular
arrhythmias in selected primary electrical and structural heart diseases are presented in Figure 1.

4.3. Population vs. individual risk
prediction
In the general population (individuals without known heart disease),

                                         the most effective approach for preventing SCD resides in quantifi
cation of the individual risk of developing CAD based on risk score
charts. [64][,][65] Several studies have provided evidence that there is a
genetic predisposition to die suddenly during acute ischaemia. [66][–][70]

The goal would be to identify the relatively small, high-risk subgroups


from the general population at risk of SCD as their first cardiac event.
Models for novel SCD risk stratification in the general population
have recently been proposed. [71][–][73] There are no clear data supporting the benefit of mass screening programs in the general population
for preventing SCD. [74][–][76]

For decades, investigators have envisioned a broad range of ‘indicators’ for SCD, especially occurring in the setting of CAD. Several
non-invasive markers of risk have been proposed (including late potentials, heart rate variability, periodic repolarization dynamics, and
baroreflex sensitivity). [77] Despite the promising outcomes of initial
studies, however, these ‘predictors’ have not yet influenced clinical
practice. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is only used, often
in combination with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, for
primary prevention indication of an ICD in the setting of chronic
CAD and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Risk stratification schemes
and calculators have been developed for inheritable arrhythmogenic
diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), and lamin A/C
(LMNA) cardiomyopathy. [78][–][82]

What is considered low, intermediate, or high risk will depend on
the type of event (e.g. fatal or not) and the risk of an event in the
background population. For instance, mortality depends on age,
sex, and other risk factors including comorbidities. The situation is
further complicated when considering a specific type of death, e.g.
SCD. Then non-SCD deaths are competing events (or competing
risks) to SCD in the sense that their occurrence prevents the observation of SCD, and may make interventions to prevent SCD, such as
an ICD, of limited benefit.

4.4. Risk calculators for sudden cardiac
death and review of the methodology
A number of risk calculators for SCD have been proposed for adult
and paediatric populations. [80][,][81][,][83][–][85] The field of prediction modelling
has evolved over the past decades, establishing standards for the development, validation (internal and external), and reporting of prediction models in SCD. [86][,][87] In addition to discrimination measures

such as the c-index, measures of calibration such as the calibration

slope have recently received more attention because it is not only
important to distinguish patients with higher risks from those with
lower risks but also to obtain a robust quantification of the risk itself
from the risk calculators. [88] Typical shortcomings in the development

and validation of risk calculators include, but are not limited to, the

use of historic samples not representative of contemporary patient
cohorts, missing values, composite outcomes with composite events
of different clinical importance, lack of external validation, and missing calibration. In this document different cut-off for 5 years risk of
SCD/VA is used for indication of ICD. Each cut-off was chosen by
the original authors and the task force group considering the competing risk, the outcome measured (SCD vs VA) and the robustness

of each risk calculator.

4.5. Awareness and intervention: public
basic life support, and access to
automated external defibrillators
Survival rate remains strikingly low after OHCA, [89][–][95] although major
regional disparities have been described. [96] Early implementation of

ESC Guidelines 4013

resuscitative interventions, especially prior to emergency medical
system arrival, has been identified as key elements to improve survival. [95][,][97] Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use
of public automated external defibrillators (AEDs) have demonstrated improvement of neurological and functional outcome as
well as survival of OHCA patients. Data support the need for


increased availability of public access defibrillators and community
training in basic life support, [89][–][95] preferably initiated in childhood
and repetitive. [98][–][100] Finally, dispatch of basic life support-trained volunteers, through specific mobile apps networks, has been shown to
increase the rate of bystander-initiated CPR, and as a result, greatly
reduces the resuscitation-free interval and improves the outcome of

4014 ESC Guidelines


OHCA victims. [101][–][103] Education of public officials and community
members regarding the importance of increasing rates of bystander
CPR and promoting the use of early defibrillation by lay and professional rescuers is critical to increasing survival rates.

### 5. Evaluation and treatment. General aspects

5.1. Diagnostic tools
5.1.1. History and physical examination
History should focus on ‘red flags’, including features of arrhythmic
syncope, e.g. absence of vagal prodrome, and family history of premature or SCD including, e.g. drowning or car accident in long QT
syndrome (LQTS), and CPVT. [1][,][106] Subtle features to suggest inherited causes include a family history of epilepsy, sudden infant death
syndrome, deafness (LQTS), heart failure, or pacemaker implantation
at,50 years old. Features of diseases related to pro-arrhythmic conditions include mid-systolic click in mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and
outflow tract murmurs with Valsalva in HCM. Specific skin features
may be relevant, e.g. Lupus pernio, erythema nodosum in sarcoidosis,
angiokeratoma in Fabry’s disease, xanthelasma/xanthoma, and palmoplantar keratosis in ARVC.

5.1.2. Laboratory testing
Natriuretic peptides (b-type-natriuretic peptide, or N-terminal
pro-b-type-natriuretic peptide) may have a role in the identification
of individuals at increased risk of SCD in the general population [107][,][108]

or in patients with CAD. [109] There is not sufficient evidence to use


b-type-natriuretic peptide as a method to select the need for an
ICD. [110][,][111]

5.1.3. Non-invasive and invasive tests

5.1.3.1. Electrocardiogram and ambulatory electrocardiographic
monitoring [2]

The 12-lead ECG is an important tool for the diagnosis of underlying
disease, for risk stratification in selected populations, and for the
diagnosis of the VA subtype, if captured. Documentation of arrhythmias related to symptoms is clinically pivotal but may be challenging
with sporadic events. The type of ECG-monitoring device and the recording time should therefore match the frequency of clinical events.
Monitoring over a period of 24–48 h (typically ‘Holter recording’) is
appropriate for daily arrhythmias, [112] while intermittent monitoring
over a longer period, with patient-activated ECG recorders (or
mobile-health/smartphones), should be preferred for infrequent
events. [113] Implantable loop recorders (ILR) can be useful in diagnosing arrhythmias in patients with potentially life-threatening symptoms, such as unexplained syncope. [114]

5.1.3.2. Signal-averaged electrocardiogram
Signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SaECG) can detect very low
amplitude signals (‘late potentials’) in the terminal QRS segment [115]

using three time-domain measurements: QRS duration, low-amplitude
(,40 µV) signal duration and root mean square voltage of terminal
40 ms QRS. [112] Abnormalities in the SaECG can also be assessed by
frequency-domain analysis. [112] SaECG can contribute to the diagnosis of ARVC. [116]

5.1.3.3. Exercise testing
Exercise testing is useful for the diagnosis and for evaluating response
to therapy in patients with suspected/proven adrenergic-dependent
rhythm disturbances, such as exercise-induced idiopathic MVT, PVT,
or bidirectional VT in CPVT. [117][,][118] The 4-minute recovery QTc after
exercise testing can contribute to the diagnosis LQTS. [119]

5.1.3.4. Imaging
Imaging is crucial to assess cardiac function and detect cardiomyopathies ( [ESC CardioMed chapter 10).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0112) [120] A negative imaging
study supports primary electrical disease in a patient with VA.
Echocardiography is a readily available and first-line diagnostic and risk
stratification tool for valve diseases, CAD and DCM, HCM, ARVC, [121]

and left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC). Echocardiographic strainrate imaging allows differentiation between active and passive movement of myocardial segments and early detection of myocardial dysfunction. Wall motion abnormalities can indicate previous infarcts,
cardiomyopathies, or inflammatory disease. Global longitudinal strain
is a robust measure of left ventricular (LV) function and can detect subtle changes in LV function while LVEF is still preserved. [122] Strain imaging
can assess mechanical dispersion reflecting inhomogeneous contraction
that could be associated with increased risk of VA. [122][–][125]

CMR currently provides the most accurate and reproducible measurement of atrial, biventricular global and regional systolic function,
and can detect myocardial oedema, fibrosis, infiltration, and

ESC Guidelines 4015


perfusion defects ( [ESC CardioMed chapter 11.4).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0106) [126] CMR is
more sensitive than echocardiography to diagnose ARVC, [127] is diagnostic in LVNC, and can detect apical aneurysms in HCM. Fibrosis
detection by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) contributes to
VA risk stratification in HCM, [128] DCM, [129] and potentially in mitral
valve prolapse arrhythmic syndrome. [130][,][131] Novel myocardial mapping techniques can detect diffuse fibrosis and can suggest the aetiology of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) for specific therapy
guiding, e.g. Fabry disease and amyloidosis. The prognostic value re
mains to be evaluated.

Cardiac imaging by computed tomography (CT) has the advantage
of a high spatial resolution ( [ESC CardioMed chapter 12.1).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0112) [132]

ECG synchronization, additional breath-hold sequences, and betablocker to lower the heart rate improve the quality. Radiation
exposure is in the range of an invasive coronary angiogram
(CAG). Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is
the preferred method to rule out coronary artery stenosis
in patients with low probability of CAD. [133][,][134] The quality of
almost all image modalities is influenced by the presence of frequent

PVCs.

5.1.3.5. Provocative diagnostic tests
These are summarized in Table 6. Common tests performed are sodium channel blocker testing for Brugada syndrome (BrS) and adenosine test to exclude latent pre-excitation. [135][,][136] Epinephrine
challenge may be useful in CPVT when exercise cannot be performed. Epinephrine test is not recommended for LQTS due to
the high false positive rate and utility of exercise testing. [137]

Coronary vasospasm as a cause of VF in the absence of obstructive
coronary diseases/cardiomyopathy can be tested with incremental
intracoronary doses of acetylcholine/ergonovine.

5.1.3.6. Electrophysiological study
Electrophysiological studies including measurement of baseline inter
– –
vals (e.g. atrial His interval [AH] and His ventricular interval [HV]),
programmed electrical stimulation (PES), and electroanatomical
mapping can be used for diagnostic purposes and to guide therapy. [145][–][150] The yield of PES varies with the underlying cardiac condition and its severity, the presence or absence of spontaneous VT,
concomitant drug therapy, stimulation protocol, and site(s) of stimulation. Typical protocols include stimulation from 2 right ventricular

–
(RV) sites with 2 3 basic drive cycle lengths, introduction of 3 extrastimuli, and isoprenaline administration. [148][,][151][,][152]

In the current era, PES is mainly employed to confirm the diagnosis
of VT and induce mappable VAs with non-inducibility being an ablation endpoint. Patients with heart failure and LVEF ≤35% generally
will have an indication for an ICD; therefore, VT/VF induction before

implantation is not necessary. In patients with SHD and mildly reduced or preserved LVEF who present with unexplained syncope, induction of SMVT with PES can be helpful to identify the underlying
cause and to predict subsequent events. [146][,][153] PVT/VF induction in
SHD is in general considered as a non-specific finding. [154][–][156]

In primary electrical diseases, PES is not of prognostic value, although there is some evidence to consider its use in BrS. [127]

Invasive electrophysiological evaluation can have important clinical
implications in patients with myotonic dystrophy. [157]


With advances in high-density mapping, voltage mapping, conduction/repolarisation metrics, and electrogram fractionation can
be employed to identify ablation targets, or to diagnose
cardiomyopathic disease. Endocardial mapping may be helpful in
the differentiation of ARVC from benign outflow tract VT and for
targeting biopsy in suspected myocarditis, ARVC, and sarcoidosis
cases. [158][–][162]

5.1.4. Genetic testing
Massive parallel or next-generation sequencing has led to increasing
availability of genetic testing at reduced cost. Most diagnostic cardiac
genetic testing employs large gene panels determined by associations
with disease generated by prior research, i.e. candidate genes. [163]

Many previous gene associations have, however, been challenged
for their diagnostic utility. Therefore, it is not recommended to include questionable genes in routine diagnostic panels. [164][–][168]

Genome-wide association studies have identified that common genetic variation single nucleotide polymorphisms can cause or modify
phenotypes in BrS, LQTS, HCM, and DCM. Polygenic risk scores,
measures derived from the cumulative effects of these single nucleotide polymorphisms, may therefore play a role in diagnosis and prognostication in these conditions in the future. [168][–][173]

Sequencing produces digital data that require subsequent bioinformatic analysis, permitting accurate ascertainment of most
DNA alterations affecting the coding frame of each gene. [174] The
most common findings are single nucleotide variants causing simple
amino acid substitutions (missense), premature terminations, or splicing abnormalities. Insertions and/or deletions are rarer. The clinical
importance of most non-coding variants is still to be
determined. [174][,][175]

A framework for the interpretation of disease causation by genetic
variants has standardized adjudication into five classes: V ‘pathogenic’; IV ‘likely pathogenic’; III ‘variant of uncertain significance’; II ‘likely
benign’; and I ‘benign’. A combination of evidence is employed: gene–
disease association; presence of a variant in healthy and/or diseased
populations; in silico data; in vitro and in vivo functional data; and family
segregation data. [176]

A mutation (Class IV or V variant) can be used immediately either
for confirmation of diagnosis in probands (the first affected family
member), or for initial diagnosis of relatives and may help to guide
therapy and/or prognosis. Periodic reassessment of all class IV and
III variants is indicated. [176]

Pre-implantation genetic testing is an early form of pre-natal genetic diagnosis. Genetic diagnoses of in vitro fertilized embryos are
identified by biopsies, thereby allowing transfer of genetically normal
embryos into the uterus. If the technique is available, it is important
to provide information to patients with monogenic heart diseases in
child-bearing age. The legislation for pre-implantation genetic testing
varies in different countries and strategies differ.
Genetic and clinical testing should be undertaken only by multidisciplinary teams including professionals with skills to counsel on the
implications and the uncertainty of results and experienced cardiologists able to direct testing to the correct phenotype. [135][,][177][–][179] A
negative result does not exclude a diagnosis and should not be
used for this purpose. A framework for genetic and other clinical
diagnostic tests for primary electrical diseases based on evidence
where available has been provided in Table 7.

genetic testing


(usually,300 ms, average 245 + 28, in one series) may identify patients at higher risk of SCD. [186][,][187] Resting 12-lead ECG is a first-line
evaluation and may show signs of SHD or primary electrical diseases
( [ESC CardioMed chapter 8.6).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0074) [188] Echocardiography is the firstline imaging modality that provides important information about cardiac function and potential SHD ( [ESC CardioMed 10.3, 10.10,](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0085)
[10.12).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0094) [120][,][189][,][190] Holter monitoring is useful to assess the frequency
of NSVT and related PVCs ( [ESC CardioMed chapter 8.9).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0798_update_001) [191] In
addition, an at least 3-lead Holter (V1, two inferior leads) may give a
first estimate if NSVT/PVC are unifocal or multifocal and of the
NSVT site(s) of origin. The latter is important if the NSVT has not
been previously documented on a 12-lead ECG. [192]

An exercise test can be helpful to capture the 12-lead ECG of
NSVT and to identify exercise-induced arrhythmias. Increasing arrhythmias with exercise, not suggestive of idiopathic origin, should
raise suspicion of SHD and may necessitate advice to refrain from
physical exercise until diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment. Underlying significant CAD should be ruled out according to
the patient’s pre-test probability.
CMR should be considered when cardiomyopathies or inflammatory diseases are suspected on initial evaluation ( ESC
[CardioMed chapter 10.4).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0086_update_001) [193] In addition, CMR can identify areas of
fibrosis as substrates of NSVT. [129]

5.2. Diagnostic evaluation at first
presentation with ventricular
arrhythmia in patients without known
cardiac disease

VA and (aborted) SCD are common first manifestations of a previously not known cardiac condition. A comprehensive diagnostic
evaluation is provided for five frequently encountered scenarios.

5.2.1. Scenario 1: Incidental finding of a
non-sustained ventricular tachycardia
An algorithm for the evaluation of patients presenting with an incidental finding of NSVT is presented in Figure 2.
Incidental NSVT is a common finding during routine cardiological
evaluation (e.g. for non-cardiac diseases, pre-initiation of oncological
treatments, pre-participation in sports) and monitoring before induction of anaesthesia/sedation for non-cardiac procedures. [184]

Patients with incidentally found NSVT require further evaluation.
A recent syncope suspicious for cardiac origin is a high-risk symptom
and may prompt admission to hospital. [1][,][185] The morphology of
NSVT (polymorphic or monomorphic) is important to assess.
Typical MVT morphologies (Figure 3) can suggest an idiopathic origin
with favourable prognosis. In contrast, short-coupled PVC initiating
non-sustained PVT or monomorphic NSVT with short cycle length

5.2.2. Scenario 2: First presentation of sustained
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia
An algorithm for the evaluation of patients presenting with a first
SMVT episode is presented in Figure 4.
The majority of patients presenting with SMVT have
underlying SHD. SMVT in SHD is mainly due to scar-related
re-entry and only occasionally due to re-entry involving a
diseased conduction system or due to focal sources.

ESC Guidelines 4019

according to patient profile and symptoms. [e] Consider re-evaluation in case of new symptoms or changes in patient clinical condition.


The diagnosis of the underlying aetiology and identification of
patients with idiopathic VT is important. Initial evaluation includes a comprehensive clinical and family history, 12-lead
ECG, and echocardiography. Recording of the 12-lead VT ECG
is indicated as it provides important information on the VT
site of origin. Specific VT morphologies (e.g. right ventricular
outflow tract [RVOT] or fascicular origin) (Figure 3) in the absence of a family history for cardiomyopathies and without evidence for SHD are suggestive for idiopathic VTs. [196] Atypical
ECG morphologies and uncommon clinical presentations should
raise suspicions for underlying SHD even if baseline ECG and
echocardiogram are normal. In this scenario, additional evaluation with CMR should be considered. [194] Bundle branch re
entrant ventricular tachycardia (BBR-VT), resembling bundle
branch block configuration on the ECG, is a feature of


conduction impairment, e.g. in DCM, myotonic dystrophy, and
post-cardiac valve surgery (Figure 5).
If initial evaluation raises suspicion of underlying CAD, a CAG can
exclude significant CAD. If ECG and echocardiography are suggestive
for a cardiomyopathy, CMR provides important diagnostic information on scar distribution and tissue characteristics (Section 5.1.3.4).

When non-invasive evaluation is inconclusive, electroanatomical

mapping and PES may be considered for the differential diagnosis between idiopathic VT and early ARVC. [197] Electroanatomical mappingguided biopsy can be of value to provide a tissue diagnosis for ARVC
and inflammatory diseases with a focal distribution (e.g. cardiac sarcoidosis). [198][,][199] In cases of suspected inflammatory diseases, positron emission tomography CT (PET-CT), autoimmune serology,
and biopsies of affected tissue are part of the diagnostic
evaluation. [200][,][201]

5.2.3. Scenario 3: Sudden cardiac arrest survivor

An algorithm for the evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest survivors is
presented in Figure 6.
Urgent CAG is recommended for patients presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). [203][–][206] Despite disparate findings
of pooled data analyses, [207][–][211] three randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) have found no significant benefit for early CAG in cardiac arrest (CA) without ST-elevation. In case of electrical instability after
CA, suspicious for ongoing ischaemia, this panel found a CAG indicated. Brain and chest CT scan may acutely identify non-cardiac causes
of aborted SD, [212] as well as blood test results for pertinent toxicological analysis. [213][–][215] Retention and storage of suitable blood samples
will allow subsequent diagnostic evaluation, including DNA analysis. [213]

Any ECG tracing from emergency services, as well as recordings
from interrogation of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices
(CIEDs) can also contribute to diagnosis. [216][–][219] The resting 12-lead
ECG (including high precordial lead) [220] is fundamental and should
be repeated regularly during recovery. Continuous heart rhythm
monitoring is recommended until definite treatment. [221][,][222]

Echocardiography may allow early diagnosis to identify any structural
abnormality. [222][,][223] Coronary imaging will be important to exclude
CAD, dissection, or anomalies. [62][,][224] Coronary optical coherence
tomography and/or intravascular ultrasound may be helpful to
characterize stenosis/plaque stability and underlying mechanism of
stenosis. [225] CMR has repeatedly been shown to provide significant incremental diagnostic value, in particular for concealed cardiomyopathy. [131][,][226][–][228] Primary electrical diseases may be uncovered by
provocative manoeuvres such as sodium channel blocker challenge, [136][,][229][–][231] lying to standing ECGs, [232][,][233] adenosine challenge, [144][,][234] epinephrine challenge, [141][,][152][,][235][–][239] ergonovine/
acetylcholine, [222][,][240] mental stress, [241][,][242] and exercise
testing. [116][,][117][,][119][,][232][,][243] Electrophysiological study and electroanatomic mapping may be useful to provide patient-specific insights


into the mechanism of CA and to offer therapeutic options in
some patients. [244][–][248] Genetic testing may identify a molecular
cause of SCA by identifying pathogenic mutations in genes associated with specific phenotypes. [213][,][249][,][250]

5.2.4. Scenario 4: Sudden death victim

An algorithm for the evaluation of SD victims is presented in Figure 7.
Potential genetic cardiac disease can be identified in 25–49% of
cases of SCD in the young (,50 years of age). This may also affect
relatives of the deceased. [25][,][56][,][59] To find the cause of death, it is important to collect all available data on prior symptoms, comorbidities, and family history. [25][,][56][,][215][,][262][,][263]

The main role of autopsy in SD is to establish the cause of death.
An expert cardiac pathologist alters the initial diagnosis in 41% of
cases, highlighting the need for expert evaluation. [263][–][265] Inherited
cardiac diseases identified at autopsy include cardiomyopathies
(HCM, DCM, ARVC) and premature CAD. [25][,][27][,][56][,][266] A toxicology
screen can reveal drug overdose or polypharmacy in 31–56% of
young SD cases. [267][,][268] In autopsy-negative cases with negative toxicology, the term sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS) may be
applied and primary electrical diseases are potential
causes. [56][,][183][,][223][,][253] Retaining tissue for DNA extraction is important
for post-mortem genetic analysis, where the yield can be as high as
one out of three. [183][,][269][,][270]

Clinical evaluation of first-degree relatives is important if the cause
of death after autopsy is unknown (Section 5.2.5, scenario 5) or

5.2.5. Scenario 5: Relatives of sudden arrhythmic
death syndrome decedents
An algorithm for the evaluation of relatives of SADS decedents is
presented in Figure 8.
Studies evaluating families of SADS decedents have identified underlying genetic heart disease in relatives that is pre
sumed to be the cause of death in the absence of other

findings. The overall diagnostic yield ranged from 18 to 53%,


depending on population and clinical investigative protocols. [276] Aetiologies included LQTS, BrS, CPVT, and other disorders, such as cardiomyopathy. [276] All study protocols relied
upon a similar initial approach of evaluating the decedent’s
pathological reports, medical history, and circumstances of
death, and then offering clinical evaluation to relatives with a minimum of personal history, family history, physical examination,
ECG and exercise test, and echocardiography. [223][,][252][,][253][,][277][–][282]

Where they diverged was the frequency of usage of additional
tests such as high-lead ECGs, Holter monitoring, signal-averaged
ECG, CMR, and provocative testing. [135] Sodium channel blocker
drug challenge and high-lead ECGs systematically performed in
SADS relatives provided a yield of 28% BrS diagnoses in one
study [281] ; however, there are concerns about false positives. [139]

Furthermore, epinephrine challenge has not been studied systematically in SADS families but, in the opinion of this panel,
may be of utility in CPVT-suspected patients who are unable
to exercise. [137]

Recent data indicated at least a 13% genetic yield in SADS
cases. [135][,][178][,][183][,][276][,][283] Routine follow-up of families without a diagnosis yields little in new diagnoses, [284] although children of decedents
may be followed for age-penetrant disease until adulthood. [181]

If an autopsy is ambiguous, or if an autopsy was not undertaken in
a young SCD case with family or personal history suspicious for inherited heart disease, then the yield of familial evaluation was similar
to that in clear SADS cases. [223][,][253][,][271]

### 6. Therapies for ventricular arrhythmias. General aspects

6.1. Acute management

6.1.1. Treatment of reversible causes
Reversible causes may account for up to 50% of SCA. [285][,][286] However,
most of the time it is difficult to determine the exact underlying cause of
SCA and whether it is reversible. A comprehensive evaluation of patients with SCA is mandatory if the underlying cardiac disease is unknown or disease progression is suspected (Section 5.2.3, scenario 3).
Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalaemia, may trigger VA, and a rapid rise in extracellular potassium may lead to asystole. [287][–][289] Other factors such as bradycardia, ischaemia, coronary spasm, thrombosis, fever,
acute starvation, and dieting may contribute to the occurrence of VA.
290–292 Acute correction of these reversible factors is recommended.

Drug-induced arrhythmias should be suspected in patients being
treated with agents known to alter the electrical properties of the heart
(e.g. inducing QRS and/or QT prolongation) or causing electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. thiazide and loop diuretics). When drug-induced arrhythmias are presumed, any offending drug needs to be withdrawn
and substances that are known to prolong QT (e.g. sotalol) should
be avoided. [293][,][294] Hypomagnesaemia and/or hypokalaemia may be associated with Torsades de pointes (TdP). Intravenous magnesium is an
effective therapy for TdP even in the absence of hypomagnesaemia. [295]

In refractory cases of recurrent TdP in the setting of acquired long QT,
the arrhythmia can be suppressed by increasing the underlying heart
rate using isoproterenol (isoprenaline) or transvenous pacing.
Patients who survive SCA in the context of a presumed reversible
cause may have a high mortality rate. [286] In a recent large observational
study [296] on survivors of SCA attributed to a reversible and correctable
cause, subsequent ICD implantation was associated with lower all-cause
mortality except for aborted CA occurring in the presence of acute
myocardial infarction (MI). Thus, the need for prophylactic ICD implantation should be considered based on the underlying cardiac disease and
an individual evaluation of the future risk of life-threatening VA.

6.1.2. Acute management of sustained
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia
Patients presenting with SMVT should be treated according to symptoms and aetiology (Figure 9). Patients presenting with haemodynamic instability require immediate synchronized cardioversion. If
synchronization is not possible, an unsynchronized shock should
be used. Cardioversion is not indicated in patients with repetitive
NSVTs (Figure 10). Documentation of any haemodynamically tolerated wide QRS tachycardia on 12-lead ECG is important.
Administration of adenosine [300] or vagal manoeuvres with continuous
recording of 12-lead ECG should be considered if supraventricular
tachycardia (SVT) is likely. Intravenous adenosine may also terminate
specific VT subtypes. Such a response supports cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated triggered activity as an underlying
VT mechanism. [301] Pre-excited atrial fibrillation (AF) can be recognized by the ‘FBI’ (fast, broad, irregular) ECG pattern. It may mimic
VT, and intravenous administration of drugs that slow AV conduction,

such as adenosine, beta-blockers, and amiodarone, should be
avoided. [302] Prompt termination of SMVT is recommended even for
tolerated SMVT, as rapid haemodynamical deterioration may occur.

c Considering limited availability of the other anti-arrhythmic drugs.

4030 ESC Guidelines

Termination can be achieved with electrical cardioversion, anti
arrhythmic medications, or pacing techniques. All anti-arrhythmic
drugs (AADs) may lead to hypotension, but the individual risk of
anaesthesia/sedation required for cardioversion also needs to be
considered. For pharmacological termination of a haemodynamically tolerated VT of unknown aetiology, intravenous procainamide
or amiodarone can be used. In the PROCAMIO trial, [303] procainamide therapy was associated with a higher proportion of tachycardia termination and fewer major cardiac adverse events than
amiodarone. Intravenous procainamide should not be used in patients with severe heart failure, acute MI, and end-stage renal disease.
Administration of other AADs (ajmaline, sotalol, and flecainide) [304][,][305]

may be considered in patients without significant heart disease, but
the risk of adverse events should be carefully weighed. Availability
of AADs has to be taken into account, e.g. procainamide is not available in many European countries. In patients with an ICD, manual


overdrive pacing may terminate those VTs with a cycle length under
the programmed ICD detection rate. In case of a known idiopathic VT
(Figure 4), treatment with beta-blockers (for RVOT VT) [306] or verapamil (for fascicular VT) [307] is recommended for acute conversion.
Although verapamil may terminate other types of idiopathic VT, [307]

important adverse effects such as severe hypotension may occur.
If the VT aetiology is uncertain, intravenous administration of verapamil is not recommended. [308][,][309] A comprehensive evaluation of
patients presenting with SMVT is mandatory if the underlying
cardiac disease is unknown or disease progression is suspected
(Section 5.2.2, scenario 2).

6.1.3. Management of electrical storm and incessant
ventricular tachycardia
An electrical storm is common in ICD patients and has been defined
as three or more episodes of sustained VA occurring within 24 h,

ESC Guidelines 4031


requiring either anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) or cardioversion/
defibrillation, with each event separated by at least 5 min. [310][–][312]

Patients who experience an electrical storm are prone to psychological disorders, heart failure decompensation, and increased mortality. [313][,][314] The severity of an electrical storm can range from
recurrent asymptomatic VT episodes terminated by ATP to a lifethreatening electrical instability with VA that recurs frequently after


multiple shocks. Frequent ICD shocks can also be inappropriately delivered (Figure 11).
In cases of inappropriate ICD shocks (e.g. due to SVTs or lead defects) or unnecessary ICD therapy (e.g. for NSVT or for repetitive VTs
that terminate and restart spontaneously), disabling of ICD therapies is
recommended. If an electrophysiology specialist or programmer is not
available, the ICD can be disabled by placing a magnet over the device.














Figure 11 Part One. Management of patients with electrical storm or repeated implantable cardioverter defibrillator discharges.

4032 ESC Guidelines


In case of haemodynamic instability at initial evaluation, institution
of advanced life support (ALS) is recommended. [315] Reversible conditions contributing to initiation and perpetuation of VA need to be
corrected (see Section 6.1.1). Further management depends on the
type of VA and the underlying aetiology. [312][,][316] A multifaceted approach is often required for management, consisting of ICD reprogramming when appropriate, AAD therapy, sedation, catheter
ablation, autonomic modulation, and mechanical circulatory support.
Elevated sympathetic tone needs to be addressed. For patients
with recurrent ICD shocks, sedation is indicated to alleviate psychological distress and decrease pro-arrhythmogenic sympathetic tone.
Initial treatment with beta-blockers, preferably non-selective betablockers like propranolol, which was superior to metoprolol in
one study, [317] combined with amiodarone [318] is most commonly
used. In patients with recurrent haemodynamically not-tolerated
VTs resistant to amiodarone, landiolol (ultra-short-acting
β1-selective blocker) was found to be effective for arrhythmia


suppression in two smaller studies. [319][,][320] Administration of other
AADs such as procainamide, [321] lidocaine, [322] or quinidine [296][,][297] depends on the specific situation, type of VA, and underlying aetiology.
When electrical storm remains intractable, with multiple shocks in a
few hours, despite available anti-arrhythmic therapies, deep sedation/intubation should be considered, along with mechanical ventilation. [325] If beta-blocker treatment is insufficient or not tolerated to
decrease sympathetic tone, selected patients may benefit from autonomic modulation, i.e. percutaneous ganglionic stellate blockade, [326]

thoracic epidural anaesthesia, [327] or left cardiac sympathetic
denervation. [328]

The most common arrhythmia underlying electrical storm is

SMVT associated with SHD that is amenable to catheter ablation. [313][,][329] Successful ablation was associated with a significant reduction in VT and electrical storm recurrence and improved
long-term survival in retrospective analyses. [330][,][331] In patients with incessant slow MVT, catheter ablation is preferred over AAD therapy,

which may only further slow VT. Catheter ablation should also
be considered in patients with recurrent symptomatic episodes
of PVT or VF triggered by a similar PVC. [221][,][332][–][334] Institution
of mechanical circulatory support may be considered for
haemodynamic stabilization, when conventional therapy fails,
and to provide circulatory support during ablation. [335] In a recent
meta-analysis [336] including 2465 patients, a substantially lower
mortality was observed with prophylactic mechanical circulatory
support treatment among patients suffering from electrical storm
or high-risk PAINESD score. [337] In contrast, rescue use of mechanical circulatory support during ablation was associated with a
high mortality rate. [338] In patients with electrical storm due to recurrent PVT/VF, the underlying aetiology determines further
management (Figure 11).

Modification of risk factors, when possible, is important for prevention of
pro-arrhythmia. In patients who require a potentially arrhythmiainducing drug, regular ECG and other tests according to the patient’s
profile and AAD characteristics are recommended (Figures 12 and 13).

6.2.2. Device therapy
6.2.2.1. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator
ICD is an integral part of treating patients surviving a CA due to a VA
or those deemed to be at high risk thereof. Drawbacks are the high
up-front device costs, device-associated complications, and the relatively high number-to-treat needed to prevent one SCD in primary

prevention.
A patient-level meta-analysis of the three early ICD trials [349][–][351]

comparing ICD to medical therapy for secondary prevention of
SCD demonstrated a 28% mortality reduction (HR 0.72; 95% CI
0.6–0.87; P = 0.0006) almost entirely due to reduction of arrhythmic
death (HR 0.5; 95% CI 0.37–0.67; P, 0.0001) in the ICD group. [352]


Therefore, the use of an ICD for secondary prevention of SCD
that occurred in the absence of reversible causes is widely accepted.
Several randomized controlled trials [353][–][356] have established the

role of the ICD for primary prevention of SCD in heart failure patients with an LVEF ≤35%. The reported mortality reduction has recently been supported by two large contemporary prospective
registries enrolling more than 5000 patients. [357][,][358] In the
EU-CERT-ICD trial, primary prevention ICD implantation was associated with a 27% lower mortality with similar results in CAD and
DCM. [357] Results of the DANISH trial, however, indicate that the
mortality benefit may be less clear in contemporary patients with
non-ischaemic heart failure (see Section 7.1.3.1). [359]

In the work-up for ICD therapy, it is of paramount importance to
consider the patient’s life expectancy, quality of life, and comorbidities,
and to reassess and discuss these issues with the patient at the time of
generator change. There is evidence that patients with end-stage renal
disease, with diabetes, and elderly patients benefit less or not at all from

a primary prevention ICD. [357][,][360][–][362] Women have been underrepresented in all primary prevention trials and data suggest that they may
benefit less. [361] In general, the SCD risk needs to be weighed against
the individual’s competing risk of a non-arrhythmic death. [363][,][364]

In the context of patient-centred medicine, physicians and healthcare professionals should engage ICD candidates and recipients in a
joint decision process. Communication of relevant information, ensuring a good understanding of the benefits, risks, and potential consequences of different options, to enable the patient to partake in
decision-making is mandatory. This shared decision-making process
should discuss the different scenarios including primary prevention
ICD implantation, consideration of ICD generator replacement,
and end-of-life care. Importantly, the perception of ‘good quality of
life’ depends on numerous factors that are weighed differently by
people with different cultural, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Although clinical prediction scores, such as the
MADIT-ICD benefit score, [365] may provide helpful additional information, clinical decision-making should not only rely on such scores.


Complications of ICD therapy include inappropriate therapies,
lead fractures, and device-related infections. A subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) has been introduced to address problems related to transvenous leads. S-ICD has no

intravascular lead and therefore cannot deliver ATP. In the

PRAETORIAN trial, 849 patients with an ICD but no pacing indication were randomized to an S-ICD or a transvenous ICD. [366] Over a

mean follow-up of 49 months, non-inferiority was shown for the primary endpoint of device-related complications and inappropriate
shocks. The rate of inappropriate shocks was 9.7% in the S-ICD

–
group and 7.3% in the ICD group (HR 1.43; 95% CI 0.89 2.30)
and the rate of device related complications was 5.9% in the S-ICD

–
and 9.8% in the ICD group (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.44 1.09). There
was also no difference in the secondary endpoint of death and appropriate shocks, but the trial had not been powered to show noninferiority for this secondary endpoint. Of note, more than 80% of
the included patients were in NYHA class I and II and the included
patients were younger than in prior ICD trials.

6.2.2.2. Adding cardiac resynchronization therapy [2]

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) does reduce mortality in
heart failure, [367] and careful evaluation of the potential benefit of
CRT in patients with ICD indication before implantation is mandatory. [2] The role of the addition of a defibrillator is less well established. [368][,][369] The ongoing randomized controlled RESET-CRT trial
aims to determine the impact of CRT-defibrillator on overall mortality and SCD in heart failure patients with a CRT indication.

6.2.2.3. Wearable cardioverter defibrillator
The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) is an external defibrillator that has been shown to successfully detect and treat VT and
VF. [370] It is therefore suitable for patients who are at risk but temporarily not candidates for an ICD owing, for example, to extraction of
an infected device and subsequent antibiotic treatment. [371] An unsolved problem is the protection of patients in the early phase (40
days) after an MI. The VEST trial enrolled 2302 patients with acute
MI and an LVEF ≤35% and randomized them early in a 2:1 fashion
to receive a WCD or not under guideline-directed optimal medical
treatment (OMT). [372] After a follow-up of 90 days there was no difference in the primary endpoint of arrhythmic death (1.6 vs. 2.4%; RR
0.67; 95% CI 0.37–1.21; P = 0.18). Concern was raised regarding the

–
low median wear time of 18 h (IQR 3.8 22.7). The median wear time

–
was higher (23.4 h, IQR 22.2 23.8) in a recent multicentre registry
after structured patient education. [371] However, based on the avail
able data, the task force does not recommend routine use of the

WCD in the early post-MI phase. Nevertheless, the use of the device
may be considered in selected post-MI patients deemed to be at high

risk for SCD.

Data on the benefit of the WCD for primary prevention of SCD in
other clinical situations (e.g. acute myocarditis, primary prevention
indication during pregnancy) are sparse and no recommendations
can be currently made.

6.2.3. Special aspects of device therapy
6.2.3.1. Optimization of device programming
Optimization of ICD programming is essential to minimize the burden of ICD therapy and to improve patient outcome. [373][–][375] Detailed
recommendations are available in expert consensus papers. [376][,][377]

Bradycardia mode should be customized to prevent unnecessary
RV pacing, thus reducing heart failure hospitalizations and all-cause
mortality [378][–][380] ( [ESC CardioMed chapter 43.21).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0562) [381] A tachycardia detection programming strategy incorporating prolonged settings and high rate thresholds (≥188 b.p.m. Advance III trial, [382] ≥200
MADIT-RIT [383] ) reduces ICD therapies and all-cause mortality without increasing the risk of syncope. [373][,][382][,][383] The evidence is stronger
for primary prevention compared to secondary prevention indications [382] ( [ESC CardioMed chapter 43.21).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0562) [381] Consistent use
of SVT/VT discriminators even in rates up to 230 b.p.m. is recommended in ICD recipients without complete heart block to reduce
inappropriate therapies. [383][–][385] Proper atrial sensing is a prerequisite
for activation of dual-chamber discriminators [376] ( ESC
[CardioMed chapter 43.21).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0562) [381] In general, a multi-zone detection programming is favoured to enable tailored use of detection and therapy
settings at different tachycardia rates. [383][,][386] A single-zone programming with a high cut-off rate may be considered in patients with a
high likelihood of VF only (e.g. primary electrical diseases). [387] In subcutaneous ICDs, a dual-zone configuration should be adopted.
Standardized programming including a lower ‘conditional shock’
zone with activated discrimination algorithms and a higher ‘shock
zone’ based on rate criteria only has been shown to reduce inappropriate shock rates without compromising patient safety. [388][–][390]

Systematic use of ATP before shock delivery, also for very fast ventricular tachyarrhythmias, has been shown to reduce shock therapy
without increase in arrhythmic syncope. [375][,][384][,][391] Burst ATP is preferred over ramp due to increased efficacy in first tachycardia termination. [392] Incorporation of remote monitoring into follow-up
practice of ICD recipients should be promoted to optimize surveillance of device integrity, to enable prompt detection and management of actionable events, and to prevent occurrence of
inappropriate shocks [393][–][396] ( [ESC CardioMed chapter 43.](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0562)
[21).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0562) [381] The proposed recommendations for optimal device programming are applicable to the majority of ICD recipients.
Customization may be needed in individual patients.

6.2.3.2. Concomitant treatment to avoid inappropriate
implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapy
Apart from optimization of device programming, pharmacological
and/or invasive management may prevent inappropriate ICD
therapy. Beta-blockers (carvedilol superior to metoprolol in
MADIT-CRT) should be titrated to the maximal tolerated dose
in heart failure patients to reduce the risk of inappropriate therapy. [400] In patients with inappropriate therapies due to recurrent
SVT, catheter ablation should be first-line treatment, given its high
success and low complication rate. [302][,][401][–][403] In case of AF-related
inappropriate therapies, unresponsive to optimized pharmacological rate control treatment, individualized treatment strategy
(rate vs. rhythm) dependent on patient characteristics is suggested. [348] In patients with early AF, adoption of a rhythm control
strategy improved patient outcome in the EAST-AFNET 4 trial. [404]

In CRT-defibrillator patients, AV node ablation has been associated with reduced inappropriate ICD shocks and lower hospitalization rates compared to drug treatment [405] ( ESC
[CardioMed chapter 41.14).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0507_update_001) [406]

6.2.3.3. Psychosocial impact of implantable cardioverter
defibrillator treatment
Almost 20% of ICD recipients suffer from anxiety and depression
that are associated with increased mortality. [408][–][411] In ICD patients,
psychological distress is mainly caused by the concern of potentially
receiving ICD shocks rather than by having experienced an ICD
shock. [412][,][413] Thus, assessment of ICD concerns is recommended

in all ICD patients before ICD shocks occur. Systematic screening
of ICD patients for psychological distress is feasible with the use of
specific questionnaires. [413][–][416]

A significant proportion of ICD patients with clinically relevant
symptoms of anxiety and depression remains undertreated. [417]

Communication with all ICD recipients is needed to clarify misconceptions about the device function, to discuss concerns about sexual
functioning, driving restrictions, and to recommend an action plan in
case of shock therapy. [418][,][419] Referral to mental health professionals
may be needed for specific interventions. [418][,][420] Cognitive behavioural therapy intervention may also be provided by trained cardiac
nurses to alleviate anxiety. [421] Web-based interventions may also
prove useful in improving psychosocial well-being in ICD patients
with increased psychosocial distress. [422]

VAs are common among left ventricular assist device (LVAD) carriers. [425][–][428] VAs are usually well-tolerated, as LVADs maintain adequate cardiac output and prevent circulatory collapse. [429]

However, sustained untreated VAs may lead to circulatory collapse
even in the presence of an LVAD, especially early after device implantation and in patients with higher pulmonary vascular resistance. [430] VAs pre- and post-LVAD implantation are associated with
an increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, while
ICD can significantly reduce sustained VA. [425][,][426][,][431][–][434] These data
support ICD implantation for secondary prevention in LVAD recipients with symptomatic VA.
Observational studies in patients with previous-generation, pulsatile LVADs reported a longer survival with ICD [435][–][437] ( ESC
[CardioMed chapter 37.32).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0432) [438]

Recent registries enrolling continuous-flow LVAD carriers have
questioned ICD mortality reduction, but available data are inconsistent. [425][,][426][,][428][,][439][,][440] An analysis of the INTERMACS registry, enrolling the largest continuous-flow LVAD cohort, showed that ICD
presence was not associated with prolonged survival. [428] The lack
of documented survival benefit among continuous-flow LVAD carriers, in conjunction with the likelihood of VA tolerance and the associated risks of ICD placement in these patients (risk of infection,
device interaction), favours an individualized approach.

6.2.3.5. Complications of devices
Prevention of ICD complications is important to reduce associated
morbidity, mortality, and financial burden. During implantation of devices, antibiotic prophylaxis, peri-procedural patient preparation,
and appropriate surgical technique should be implemented to prevent device infections and formation of pocket haematoma. [441][–][443]

Cephalic or axillary vein access is preferred over the subclavian
vein route to reduce the risk of pneumothorax and lead failure. [444][–][446] Proper selection of ICD systems is important.
Single-chamber ICDs are recommended in primary prevention patients without atrial or AV sequential pacing indications. This reduces
peri-procedural complications and generator replacements as compared to dual-chamber ICDs. This approach does not increase the
risk of inappropriate shocks if optimal device programming is
used. [447][–][450] Routine use of single-coil defibrillator leads is favoured
due to reduced risk of complications during lead removal without associated differences in shock efficacy. [451][,][452] Use of dual-coil leads can
be considered in clinical settings where a higher defibrillator threshold is suspected, e.g. HCM, right-sided implantations. [453][,][454]

6.2.3.6. End-of-life issues
Patients with active ICDs experience a considerable rate of shocks in
the last phase of life. [455] In terminally ill patients and at the end of life,
healthcare professionals can facilitate a decision by the patient and
the patient’s family by explaining in a sensitive and understandable
manner the benefits and burdens of continued ICD therapy. [456]

Patients should be informed about the options of ICD deactivation.
In general, deactivation of anti-bradycardia therapy is discouraged to
avoid quality-of-life impairment, and in some countries deactivation
in pacemaker-dependent patients may be prohibited by law. [457]

Deactivation should be discussed before device implantation and
when there is significant deterioration of the patient’s health status.
Despite an increasing trend to address and perform device deactiva
tion after careful consideration, current rates are still low and improved patient care is needed. [458][,][459]

6.2.4. Interventional therapy
6.2.4.1. Catheter ablation

6.2.4.1.1. Patients with structural heart disease. In patients with
SHD, SMVTs are primarily due to a scar-related re-entrant
mechanism. [460][–][465]

Because of a higher risk of SCD, an ICD implantation is usually
recommended in patients with sustained VAs associated with


SHD. [466][–][468] However, ICDs do not prevent VA, and many of these
patients will experience symptomatic VT/VF recurrences resulting in
syncope or ICD shocks and may require additional treatment. [330][,][383][,][419][,][469][–][471]

In patients with SHD, the choice of anti-arrhythmic agents is mostly limited to beta-blockers, sotalol, and amiodarone to help control
VT/VF recurrences, and this treatment is frequently hampered by
side effects. [318][,][472]

Owing to advances made over the last three decades, catheter
ablation has become increasingly important for the management
of scar-related VTs. [473] Since the early 1990s, catheter ablation of
BBR-VT has been very successful [474][–][477] and is considered as firstline therapy [466][,][467] (Figure 5). Subsequently, catheter ablation has
been shown to be very effective in controlling incessant VTs or
electrical storms [330][,][331] and in reducing subsequent VT burden.
Many observational studies have shown a positive effect of VT ablation on clinical outcome in terms of VT recurrences. [478][–][483] In patients with CAD, three randomized trials [471][,][484][,][485] have reported
that catheter ablation, compared to conventional treatment, decreases the likelihood of subsequent ICD shocks and prevents recurrent VT episodes.
The critical part of re-entrant VT circuits, referred to as the ‘protected VT isthmus’, is the primary target for ablation, [460][,][486] but it is
very challenging to unmask in haemodynamically not-tolerated
VT. [487][,][488] Due to the high likelihood of multiple re-entry circuits in
a scar and difficulties in identifying critical isthmuses, the ablation
strategy has gradually evolved over the years towards more extended ablation of the arrhythmogenic substrate. [489][–][492] Special attention should be paid to cases of PVT/VF initiated by similar
PVCs, where the triggering PVC (often related to the Purkinje network) should be targeted for ablation. [221][,][332][,][333][,][493]

The electrophysiological characteristics of VT circuits depend on
the underlying SHD. Thus, post-infarct VTs are mainly related to
an endocardial VT circuit (amenable to endocardial ablation), while
the location of re-entrant VT circuits is more variable in patients
with cardiomyopathies. [494][–][496] Here, intramural and/or epicardial involvement are more common. This significantly contributes to the

difference in the clinical outcomes of VT ablation in relation to the

underlying heart disease with a better outcome in CAD as compared
to non-ischaemic aetiologies. [497][–][499]

Effective ablation requires durable ablation lesions to arrhythmogenic tissue. In some cases, such as intramural VTs, difficulties remain
in achieving this objective with current catheters, regardless of the
approach (endocardial/epicardial). [500] To improve the formation of
myocardial lesions, new catheter-based techniques are being evaluated (e.g. bipolar/needle ablation, transcoronary alcohol ablation), [501][–][506] as well as radiotherapy ablation [507][,][508] or surgical
ablation, [509] which are currently bailout treatments.
When planning VT ablation, it is important to collect all available
information about the arrhythmogenic substrate, especially to identify scars (using CMR or CT scan), [510][–][514] and to help determine the

exit site of VAs with the 12-lead ECG documentation of clinical VTs

or PVCs that induce PVT/VF.

The mean long-term success rate of VT ablation varies from
30% to 70%, depending on the underlying SHD. [481][,][515][–][518]

Peri-procedural complications, in particular stroke, cardiac tamponade, or death, may occur. [519][–][522]

4044 ESC Guidelines


6.2.4.1.2. Patients without apparent structural heart disease.
‘Idiopathic VTs’ is the term for VTs that are not associated with
SHD or a genetic arrhythmic syndrome. Most idiopathic VTs are
mediated by triggered activity, but a re-entrant mechanism (involving
the LV Purkinje network) explains verapamil-sensitive fascicular
VTs. [523] Three important key features distinguish idiopathic VTs
from VTs associated with SHD. First, idiopathic VTs mostly originate
from a single site and specific region of the heart (namely the right or
left ventricular outflow tracts, [524][,][525] along the valve annuli, [526][–][528]

papillary muscle, [529] or the LV Purkinje network). [523] Second, no detectable scar is found in idiopathic VTs. [530] Finally, idiopathic VTs have
a benign prognosis so that ICD implantation is generally not
recommended. [466]

The earliest site of activation during VT is the ablation target for
focal sources, while abnormal Purkinje tissue (with diastolic activity
during VT) is the ablation target of left fascicular VTs. [531][,][532]

Catheter ablation is curative in most idiopathic VT patients and
peri-procedural complications are rare. [533][–][537]

6.2.4.2. Autonomic modulation

The role of the autonomic nervous system in promoting arrhythmias
has long been recognized, leading to the concept of Coumel’s triangle
of arrhythmogenesis. [538]

Sympathetic activation has been demonstrated as playing a key
role in inducing VAs in some entities, such as congenital LQTS and
CPVT, [539][,][540] and left cardiac sympathetic denervation was shown
to be associated with a decrease in the frequency of arrhythmogenic syncope in congenital LQTS. [541][,][542] The efficacy of cardiac
sympathetic blockade by different approaches (thoracic epidural
anaesthesia, percutaneous stellate ganglion anaesthesia, or surgical
stellate ganglion resection) in reducing the arrhythmia burden in
refractory VT/VF has been recognized in several small observational studies. [326][,][328][,][340] Further studies are needed to assess which patients may benefit from a modulation of the autonomic nervous
system to better control VT/VF.

7.1. Specific structural heart diseases
7.1.1. Coronary artery disease
7.1.1.1. Acute coronary syndromes and vasospasm
7.1.1.1.1. Acute coronary syndromes. SCD is a major cause of
mortality in ACS, mostly caused by sustained VAs, in particular
VF. The majority of studies have reported on patients with

–
STEMI. Of patients with STEMI, 4 12% develop VA within the
first 48 h after the onset of symptoms. [69][,][543][,][544] Pre-reperfusion
VAs are more common than reperfusion-induced or postreperfusion arrhythmias in STEMI. [545] Haemodynamic instability,
cardiogenic shock, LVEF, 40%, and the sum of ST-segment deviations in all leads are independent predictors of VA both in


STEMI and non-STEMI. [69][,][546] In addition, an early repolarization
pattern has been associated with increased risk of VAs and
SCD in ACS. [547]

Prevention of ventricular arrhythmias in ST elevation myocardial
infarction
Urgent reperfusion is the most important therapy, [292][,][548] as acute
ischaemia triggers arrhythmias. Beta-blocker treatment is also
recommended to prevent VA. [3][,][549] In a recent randomized trial of patients with STEMI, early intravenous metoprolol before percutaneous coronary intervention reduced the incidence of arrhythmias
in the acute phase and was not associated with an increase in adverse
events. [550] Prophylactic treatment with AADs has not proven beneficial, and may even be harmful. [322] Correction of electrolyte imbalances is strongly recommended. [289]

Management of sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular
fibrillation in acute coronary syndrome
Electrical cardioversion or defibrillation is the intervention of
choice to acutely terminate VAs in ACS patients (Figure 14). [205][,][339]

Recurrent sustained VT, especially when polymorphic, or recurrent
VF can indicate incomplete reperfusion or recurrence of acute ischaemia. In this case, immediate coronary angiography is indicated. [3]

For recurrent PVT degenerating into VF, beta-blockers are recommended. [551][,][552] In addition, deep sedation may be helpful to reduce
episodes of VT or VF. [553] Intravenous amiodarone should be considered to acutely suppress recurrent haemodynamically relevant VAs,
although there is a paucity of controlled studies for amiodarone during STEMI [554] and the evidence in this setting is mainly extrapolated
from studies of OHCA. [555] If treatment with beta-blockers and amiodarone is not effective, lidocaine may be considered. [322] The use of
other AADs in ACS is not recommended. [549][,][556] In haemodynamically unstable patients with refractory VA, mechanical circulatory support may be considered. [336][,][557] For VA in the context of relative
bradycardia or pause-related, pacing may be effective to prevent

re-initiation.

The prognostic significance of early ventricular arrhythmias
Early VAs are defined as VT/VF occurring within 48 h after a
STEMI. In the contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI)-based revascularization era, almost all VA occur within the first
24 h. [558] Early VA have been associated with an up to six-fold increase
in in-hospital mortality, whereas long-term prognosis seems not to
be significantly affected. [543][,][559][,][560] In a prospective cohort study, patients with VF during the acute STEMI phase had low and very similar
incidence of late SCD as compared with VF-free patients during
5-year observation. [560] Of note, early monomorphic VT was associated with significantly higher incidence of adequate ICD interventions compared with early VF, and was an independent predictor

                                         of death during long-term follow-up. [561] Thus, the prognostic signifi
cance of VT and VF occurring in the acute phase of MI may be different. The impact of VA occurring late after reperfusion (.48 h) on

late SCD is less clear.
Podolecki et al. [559] recently demonstrated that long-term all-cause
mortality after STEMI was predicted by VA occurring late after reperfusion (.48 h after reperfusion), while early reperfusion VAs
did not affect 5-year outcome. Further studies are required to clarify

of patients with variant angina who survive a CA is worse than in
other patients with variant angina. [562][,][563] In a recent multicentre
European survey, [564] patients with life-threatening VAs secondary
to coronary vasospasm were at high risk for recurrence, especially
when insufficient medical therapy was administered. While calcium
channel blockers (CCB) are capable of suppressing episodes, betablockers may trigger VAs. As medical intervention and multiple vasodilator drugs may not be sufficiently protective, placement of an ICD
should still be considered in SCA survivors with variant angina.

7.1.1.2. Early after myocardial infarction
The first weeks after a STEMI carry the highest risk both for allcause death and for SCD, particularly in patients with reduced
LVEF. [565][,][566] For this reason, early assessment of LVEF, i.e. before
discharge, is recommended. [567][,][568] Early routine prophylactic ICD
implantation in the first 40 days after MI did not reduce mortality
in post-MI patients with reduced LVEF in two randomized trials
(DINAMIT and IRIS), [569][,][570] and is therefore not recommended.
Early assessment by further non-invasive tests, apart from LVEF
measurement, has also not proven to be useful for risk stratification with regard to SCD. [571] Limited evidence suggests that invasive
risk stratification by PES in the early post-MI phase may be helpful
for identification of high-risk patients with reduced LVEF. [572]

However, the utility of this approach has not been confirmed so


far in randomized studies. The PROTECT-ICD randomized trial

(NCT03588286) is currently examining whether PES may guide
the decision on ICD implantation in patients with reduced EF in
the early phase after STEMI.

                                         Reverse remodelling following an MI is associated with signifi
cantly lower rates of death, SCA, and other adverse clinical outcomes. [573][,][574] Therefore, assessment of the indication for

prophylactic ICD implantation, usually performed by repeat echocardiography, should take place in the post-remodelling phase of
the MI after the first 6 weeks in patients with a pre-discharge
LVEF ≤40%. Reassessment of the LVEF before 6 weeks following
MI may not discriminate between myocardial stunning and
remodelling.
In the early post-MI phase, electrical storm and/or recurrent
episodes of PVT or VF are immediately life-threatening conditions. In this setting, it is important to exclude ischaemia as
the triggering factor for the arrhythmias. If medical treatment
is not sufficient to suppress the arrhythmic episodes, catheter
ablation is potentially effective particularly if the episodes are focally triggered by similar PVCs. [332][,][575] If PVT recurs despite betablocker and amiodarone treatment, suppression by quinidine
therapy has been reported. [323]

ICD implantation is recommended. [356] ICD implantation should
also be considered for asymptomatic patients with an EF ≤30%. [354]

In this population, mortality reduction by an ICD has been
demonstrated in four RCTs. [353][–][356] In patients with CAD, a
reduced LVEF (≤40%), and asymptomatic NSVT, inducibility by
PES identifies patients who benefit from an ICD, independent
from NYHA class. [355]

Since the publication of the aforementioned trials, early revascularization strategies and modern heart failure medication have reduced the overall risk of SCD in heart failure patients. [577] Although
total mortality has been reduced, the relative reduction by the
ICD is a consistent 27%, which has been corroborated in two

recent large prospective registry studies enrolling 2327 European
patients between 2014 and 2018 (EU-CERT-ICD) [357] and 2610

7.1.1.3.2. Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with
preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction. There are no data supporting primary prophylactic ICD implantation in post-infarct patients with preserved or mildly reduced LVEF. These patients are
heterogeneous with regard to their potential arrhythmic substrate,
and efforts are under way to identify those with the highest risk
for SCD. PES is recommended in post-infarct patients in whom syncope remains unexplained after non-invasive evaluation to guide patient management (Figure 15). [146]

In the PRESERVE-EF study, 41 of 575 post-infarct patients with an
LVEF ≥40% and one non-invasive ECG risk factor more than 40 days
post-MI were inducible for VT/VF during PES and received an ICD. [151]

During the 32-month follow-up period, no SCD occurred and 9 of
37 ICD patients received an appropriate ICD therapy. However,
the role of appropriate ICD treatment as surrogate for SCD in patients with preserved LVEF is unknown, and randomized trials are
needed. Prophylactic treatment with AADs other than beta-blockers
is not indicated regardless of the LVEF. [556][,][578][,][579]

of arrhythmic death (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.37–0.67; P, 0.0001) in

7.1.1.3.4. Management of patients with haemodynamically tolerated ventricular tachycardia and preserved and mildly reduced

of VT after MI, as well as improved ablation and imaging technologies,
catheter ablation has become an option for the treatment of haemodynamically well-tolerated VT in selected post-MI patients with preserved or mildly reduced EF, even without ICD back-up. One small
monocentric retrospective trial studied patients with CAD, LVEF
.40%, and haemodynamically tolerated VT who underwent catheter ablation as first-line therapy. [580] The investigators could abolish


90% of the clinical and 58% of all inducible VTs. Subsequently, 42% of
the patients received an ICD. After a mean follow-up of 3.8 years,
42% of the patients died irrespective of the presence or absence
of an ICD (P = 0.47).
A larger multicentre retrospective study looked at 166 patients
with an LVEF .30% presenting with well-tolerated SMVT, which
were treated by catheter ablation only, and compared the outcome to a control group of 378 patients implanted with an
ICD. [480] Of the 166 patients undergoing ablation as first therapy,

55% suffered from CAD. The mean LVEF was 50%, and after a

mean follow-up of 32 months, overall mortality did not differ between the groups (12%).
These data suggest that either ICD implantation or ablation in experienced centres should be considered in patients with a preserved
or mildly reduced EF presenting with haemodynamically tolerated
SMVT. Of note, although ICDs have been commonly implanted in
this population, the secondary preventive ICD trials failed to show
a survival benefit in patients with an LVEF ≥35%. [352] Although
SMVT is rarely caused by ischaemia and revascularization alone

7.1.1.3.5. Management of recurrent ventricular tachycardia in implantable cardioverter defibrillator carriers. Frequent, symptomatic VT in ICD recipients should be treated medically with either
amiodarone or sotalol. [318][,][581] In patients with CAD in whom SMVT

recurs while on amiodarone treatment, catheter ablation is recom
mended over escalation of AAD therapy. In the VANISH trial, the
composite endpoint of death, VT storm, and appropriate ICD therapy was reached significantly less often in the ablation group as compared to the escalated amiodarone-therapy group over a mean

–
follow-up of 28 months (59% vs. 68.5%; HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.53
0.98; P = 0.04). [471] The ongoing VANISH2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT02830360) addresses the question of whether catheter ablation as first-line treatment is superior to AAD therapy in
post-MI patients with SMVT.
Preventive VT ablation after a first documented SMVT, which was
followed by ICD implantation, reduced neither mortality nor hospitalizations for arrhythmia or worsening heart failure when compared
to a deferred ablation strategy only after the third ICD shock. [582]


However, in patients who present with a first VT episode and in
whom an ICD is indicated, catheter ablation performed immediately
before or shortly after ICD implantation may be considered to decrease subsequent VT and ICD shocks. [484][,][485][,][583]

7.1.1.4. Coronary anomalies
Anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery, either the left or
the right, arising from the opposite sinus of Valsalva, is associated
with an increased risk of SCD, especially in individuals,35 years
during or following vigorous exercise. [585] Anomalous aortic origin
of the left coronary artery is less common but more malignant
than anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery. Other

risk factors for SCD are interarterial course between the aorta

and pulmonary artery, slit-like shaped orifice, high orifice, acuteangle take-off, and intramural course and its length. [585][,][586]

Indications for surgical intervention, especially in asymptomatic patients, are based on the evaluation of high-risk anatomy by CTA and
the assessment of exercise-induced ischaemia using advanced imaging modalities. [586][–][588] Cardiac stress imaging is also indicated to
evaluate exercise-induced ischaemia after surgical intervention, especially in patients with an aborted CA. [588]

7.1.2. Idiopathic premature ventricular complexes/
ventricular tachycardia and premature ventricular
complex-induced cardiomyopathy

7.1.2.1. Idiopathic premature ventricular complexes/ventricular
tachycardia

PVCs/VT in patients without SHD are defined as idiopathic
(Figure 17). In patients with presumed idiopathic PVCs/VT based
on a negative history and normal physical examination, 12-lead
ECG and transthoracic echocardiography are important first diagnostic steps to exclude underlying SHD. Twenty-four-hour ECG
Holter monitoring is usually performed to determine the PVC burden.
Multiform PVCs at prolonged ECG monitoring and subtle changes on
ECG or echocardiography need to be recognized. [589] CMR should be
performed whenever ECG and echocardiography are inconclusive to
rule out SHD, or the clinical presentation raises suspicion for SHD. [590][,][591]

Patients need to be treated when PVCs/VT are symptomatic or

associated with deterioration of cardiac function. The clinical course

and responses to different treatments have been mostly studied in
those originating from the RVOT or the left fascicles.


Several drugs have been used to treat idiopathic PVCs/VT.

Recommendations are based on small or non-controlled series.

Beta-blockers and CCBs are the most-studied drugs and both have
been shown to be effective at arrhythmia suppression. [304] The evidence for flecainide is scarce. [592] In case of a higher burden of
PVCs with higher heart rate or during exercise, beta-blockers should
be preferred. [593] If there is not such a correlation, the use of flecainide
or CCB drugs have been associated with more effective PVC suppression. Beta-blockers should also be selected when a focal triggered activity mechanism is suspected. CCB should be the drug of
choice for fascicular PVC/VT. Although data are lacking, betablockers or CCBs are considered first choice for PVCs with an origin
outside the RVOT or the left fascicles because flecainide may have
proarrhythmic side effects. Amiodarone is associated with severe
systemic toxicity and should be used only if ablation or other drugs
fail or cannot be used. [594] A summary of the recommendations for the
treatment of idiopathic PVCs/VT and PVC-induced or aggravated
cardiomyopathy with AADs is provided in Table 9.
A high success rate of catheter ablation of idiopathic PVCs/VT has
been reported with rare complications, particularly for the RVOT
and fascicular types. [535] In a randomized study including patients
with RVOT PVCs, ablation was superior to AAD therapy for
arrhythmia suppression with no differences in complications. [595]

Ablation is therefore recommended as the first-line therapy for

RVOT and fascicular PVCs/VT. The available information for other

forms of idiopathic PVCs/VT is limited and mostly restricted to the
acute success of ablation, which, in general, is lower and associated
with more recurrences than for RVOT and fascicular PVCs/VT. [540]

In addition, access to and ablation at specific locations (e.g. sinus of
Valsalva, LV summit) may increase the risk for procedural complications. Therefore, when the 12-lead ECG is highly suspicious of a

PVC/VT source outside the RVOT or left fascicles, the level of rec
ommendation for ablation is lower.

In general, treatment of children should be similar to that of adults.
However, ablation should be deferred in young and small children due
to the risk of complications and the relatively larger size of the ablation
lesion as compared to the child’s heart. [596][,][597] Verapamil is not recommended as the first-line therapy in children,1 year old because it has
been associated with hypotension in some case reports. [542] Of note, all
reported patients had either heart failure, overdosing of verapamil, or
other concurrent AADs at the time verapamil was given. [598]

Patients may present with asymptomatic frequent PVCs/VTs.
Only a minority of patients with .1000 PVCs per day will develop
ventricular dysfunction after 5 years follow-up. [599] A PVC burden
of 10% seems to be the minimal threshold for development of LV
dysfunction, with higher risk when the PVC burden is
.20%. [535][,][600][,][601] Regular assessment of LVEF in this setting is therefore indicated. To date, there are no data supporting the benefit of
arrhythmia treatment for asymptomatic patients with preserved
ventricular function. In addition, PVC burden often decreases spontaneously over time, particularly in children. [599][,][602] In selected patients, e.g. patients who do not want to be followed, catheter
ablation may be considered. In patients with PVC burden, 10%, reevaluation may be appropriate in case of development of new symptoms or change in patient condition.

7.1.2.2. Premature ventricular complex-induced/-aggravated
cardiomyopathy
The importance of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy as a secondary and reversible cause of LV dysfunction in patients without
SHD has been recognized. [607][,][608] The patient’s medical and
family history, 12-lead ECG, Holter-ECG, and echocardiography form the cornerstones of the evaluation of patients
with suspected PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (Figure 18).
PVC burden has been shown to be the strongest independent
predictor of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy in several studies. [600][,][609][–][611] Day-by-day fluctuations of PVC burden have
been reported in patients undergoing 14-day monitoring, but
most data are based on 24-h registrations. [611] A PVC burden of
at least 10% appears to be the minimal threshold for development of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, and the risk increases further with a PVC burden .20%. [600][,][611] In patients with a PVC
burden,10%, other cardiomyopathy aetiologies should be suspected and further diagnostic work-up undertaken. In such patients, Holter-ECG should be repeated to assess fluctuations in
PVC burden. Factors predicting adverse LV remodelling in patients with frequent PVCs include superior PVC axis, epicardial
origin, NSVT, shorter coupling interval, and male gender. [535][,][611][–][613]

Frequent PVCs can also aggravate LV dysfunction in patients with
SHD. In such cases, LV dysfunction can either be a direct consequence of PVCs as in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, or due to the
limiting effect of PVCs on optimal biventricular pacing in CRT pa
tients. Parameters such as smaller LV end diastolic diameter and

shorter intrinsic QRS duration might help to distinguish
PVC-induced cardiomyopathy from PVC-aggravated cardiomyopathy. [614] CMR should be considered for patients suspected to have
PVC-induced cardiomyopathy to exclude subtle forms of SHD. [590][,][615]

In a patient with frequent PVCs, the presence of LGE suggests SHD
with frequent PVCs rather than PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, in
which LGE is mostly absent. Given that PVCs with a RBBB morphology
have been reported to show a stronger association with LGE, [616] those
patients should be particularly considered for CMR.
The diagnosis of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy vs. PVC-aggravated
cardiomyopathy can be confirmed only after LVEF improvement/normalization (reverse remodelling) following suppression of the PVCs.
Catheter ablation of the PVCs is very efficient, with reported success rates of 75–90%, and is considered first-line treatment for
PVC-induced cardiomyopathy. [535][,][600][,][609][,][610][,][612][,][617][–][620] Factors affecting acute ablation success and clinical outcome include the site
of origin of PVCs (highest for outflow tract PVCs), the number of
PVC morphologies, and the absence of LGE on CMR. [535][,][610][,][614] In patients with SHD, catheter ablation of frequent monomorphic PVCs
has also been shown to improve LVEF in patients with both CAD and
cardiomyopathies with and without CRT. [609][,][617][,][621][–][623] Similarly, the
use of anti-arrhythmic medications for PVC suppression has been
shown to improve LVEF. In one RCT, amiodarone resulted in a better PVC suppression and a higher LVEF improvement compared to
placebo. [624] Sodium channel blockers can also effectively suppress
PVCs. [625] In one study, flecainide reduced the PVC burden from
36% to 10% and resulted in LVEF increase from 37% to 49%. [626]

While flecainide have a more favourable adverse effect profile regarding organ toxicity, increased mortality has previously been
shown in patients with MI. [556] For selected patients with suspected
PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and PVC-aggravated cardiomyopathy,
flecainide can still be considered, particularly if an ICD is in place
(Table 9).
A rare monogenetic cause of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, referred to as multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions, has been reported. It is characterized by a DCM phenotype
and the presence of numerous PVCs with RBBB and/or left bundle
branch block (LBBB) morphologies and an increased risk of SCD. [627]

Pathogenic mutations in the SCN5A gene lead to a gain of function
of the sodium channel responsible for hyperexcitability of the fascicular Purkinje system. [627][,][628] Limited data suggest that patients with
multifocal ectopic Purkinje-related premature contractions do not
respond to beta-blockers but might benefit from therapy with flecainide, quinidine, or amiodarone. [627][–][631]

7.1.3. Cardiomyopathies
7.1.3.1. Dilated cardiomyopathy and hypokinetic non-dilated
cardiomyopathy
DCM is characterized by LV dilatation and systolic dysfunction unexplained by CAD or abnormal loading conditions. [632] The true prevalence is difficult to estimate. Older studies reported a prevalence of 1
in 2700 individuals. [633]

Historic data in adults with DCM showed a 1-year mortality of
20–25% and a 50% survival at 5 years. [634] Recent trials of DCM patients with systolic heart failure and OMT report 5-year mortality
rates in the range of 21–28%. [356][,][359] SCD occurs in up to 12% of patients with DCM and still accounts for 25–35% of all deaths. [359][,][634][,][635]

In children, the annual incidence of DCM is 0.57 cases per
100 000. [636] The prognosis in children is poor, with a 5-year incidence
of heart transplantation or heart failure-related death of 40%.
However, in contrast to adults, the incidence of SCD in paediatric
DCM patients is much lower, with a 5-year incidence of 2.4–3% as
reported in two large paediatric cardiomyopathy registries from
the United States and Australia. [637][,][638]

Causes of DCM can be genetic or acquired. [639] Genetic predisposition
may also interact with extrinsic factors such as in peri-partum, alcoholic,
or chemotherapy-related cardiomyopathies. [639] The phenotype, particularly of genetic aetiologies, can change over time and/or may not

meet standard disease criteria at the time of disease manifestation. As

a consequence, a new category of a hypokinetic non-dilated cardiomyopathy (HNDCM) has been proposed. [639]

7.1.3.1.1. Diagnostic evaluation and risk stratification. An algorithm for risk stratification and primary prevention of SCD in patients with DCM/HNDCM is presented in Figure 19.
Careful diagnostic work-up, including genetic testing and CMR,
should be considered to identify the underlying cause for
aetiology-oriented risk stratification and treatment. [341][,][639]


Pathogenic mutations are identified in 25–55% of DCM patients, [634][,][639][,][640] most often with autosomal dominant inherit
ance. Truncated mutations in the titin gene (TTN) are most
frequently found, followed by LMNA, sarcomeric, and desmosomal mutations. Mutations in genes such as LMNA, PLN,
RBM20, and FLNC are associated with a higher risk of VA and
SCD. [641][–][645] Carriers of desmosomal and LMNA variants experienced the highest rate of VA/SCD, which was independent of the
LVEF in one series. [645]

The yield of genetic testing is particularly high in DCM patients with
familial forms of DCM or SCD in a first-degree relative at younger age.
An inherited DCM is also more likely in patients who present at young
age or with signs suspicious for a specific aetiology (e.g. prolonged AV
conduction for LMNA) (Figure 20). [634][,][639][,][640][,][646] First-degree relatives
of DCM/HNDCM patients should undergo clinical diagnostic evaluation, especially if an inherited cause is suspected.
Discrimination between high- and low-risk patients for SCD
remains challenging. Beyond LVEF and NYHA class, [357][,][359][,][635][,][647][–][650]

recent data suggest that both genetic and CMR findings can contribute to risk stratification. A meta-analysis of 29 studies combining
2948 patients studied the role of CMR in patients with DCM. [129]

LGE was significantly associated with the arrhythmic endpoint,
even when including only studies that performed multivariate analysis
(HR 6.7; P, 0.001). Interestingly, the association between LGE and
the arrhythmic endpoint remained significant among patients with
mean LVEF .35%. Similarly, a recent study of 1020 consecutive pa
tients with DCM and CMR observed that LGE and LVEF were both

risk markers for all-cause mortality and cardiac death, but only LGE
was significantly associated with SCD risk. [651]

SCD risk stratification has been refined in the subgroup of patients
with LMNA mutations, which represent 5–10% of all DCM patients.
LMNA mutations are associated with early atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, premature conduction disease, a high risk of SCD, and
progression to end-stage heart failure. [80][,][642][,][652][,][653] In a multicentre
registry of 269 LMNA mutation carriers, NSVT, LVEF,45% at first
evaluation, male sex, and non-missense mutations were identified as
independent risk factors for VA. [652] VA occurred only in persons with
at least two of these risk factors. The risk stratification was subsequently externally validated. [653] Another study, which involved 589
LMNA mutation carriers, identified AV block as an additional predict[or. Recently a risk calculator has been developed (https://lmna-risk-](https://lmna-risk-vta.fr/)
[vta.fr/) to predict the risk of life-threatening VA (C-index of 0.776](https://lmna-risk-vta.fr/)

–

[95% CI: 0.711 0.842]). [80] In patients with a 5-year estimated risk
≥10% and a manifest cardiac phenotype (NSVT, LVEF, 50%, or
AV conduction delay), a primary prevention ICD implantation should
be considered to avoid potential over-implantation in mutation carriers
without a cardiac phenotype. In LMNA mutation carriers with a DCM
phenotype, high-intensity exercise has been associated with a high risk
of SCD and impaired LVEF and is therefore not recommended. [654][,][655]

A risk score for VA prediction has been recently proposed for patients with DCM or ARVC related to the p.Arg14del mutation in the
PLN gene. [656] Validation studies are needed before it can be recom
mended for clinical use.

Beyond genetics and CMR, additional SCD predictors have been
suggested, often derived from small cohorts with no or few replication studies. An unexplained syncope requires further evaluation and
PES may determine the underlying cause. The risk for arrhythmic

events in DCM patients with a low LVEF and an unexplained syncope
was similar to those with prior CA [657] and high, independent from
the outcome of PES. [148] However, data in DCM patients with a mildly
reduced EF suggest an incremental value of PES. Among DCM patients with an EF ≥40% and an unexplained syncope, who underwent
ICD implantation after a positive PES, 80% had appropriate ICD
therapy during follow-up. No SCD or symptomatic VA occurred
in non-inducible patients. [146]

7.1.3.1.2. Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. In patients

Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic
heart failure is mandatory. [342] Re-evaluation of cardiac function and
clinical status after 3 months’ OMT is required before primary prevention ICD implantation. LV function is more likely to improve in
DCM caused by myocarditis or TTN mutations.
The efficacy of primary prevention ICDs in DCM patients with
HFrEF has been addressed in six RCTs. [635]

Five studies were published between 2002 and 2005 (CAT,
AMIOVIRT, DEFINITE, COMPANION, and SCD-HeFT). The
first three were smaller studies enrolling only DCM patients,
whereas SCD-HeFT and COMPANION were larger and

[95% CI 0.55, 0.87], P, 0.002). [658] This effect persisted when

COMPANION was excluded.

More recently, the DANISH trial enrolled 1116 symptomatic patients
(NYHA class II or III) with non-ischaemic systolic heart failure (LVEF ≤
35%). Patients were randomized to ICD or no ICD after OMT. [359] No
reduction in the primary endpoint of all-cause death for patients


randomized to ICD therapy (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.68–1.12; P = 0.28)
was observed, despite a significant reduction in SCD in the ICD group
(HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.31–0.82; P = 0.005). Potential explanations are the
low SCD rate in the trial (4.3% in the ICD group and 8.2% in the control
group), the excellent medical treatment (.90% of patients on ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, .50% on MRA), and the high prevalence
(58%) of CRT. A meta-analysis of all six primary prevention trials still demonstrated a reduction, although lower, in overall mortality with ICD
therapy (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.65–0.91; P = 0.002). [635] In a sensitivity analysis, the benefit of ICD therapy was maintained after the removal of any
single study from the pooled analysis.

ESC Guidelines 4057


The results of the DANISH trial emphasize the need for further
refining the indication for primary prevention ICDs in contemporary DCM patients. Age and comorbidity need to be considered. [635]

                                         In the DANISH trial, ICD implantation was associated with a signifi
cantly lower rate of death in younger patients. [359] A further analysis
of the DANISH data [647] showed an association between reduced

all-cause mortality and ICDs in patients ≤70 years of age (HR,
0.70; 95% CI 0.51–0.96; P = 0.03), but not in patients .70 years
of age.
Prospective studies evaluating the benefit of ICDs in DCM/
HNDCM patients with intermediate LV dysfunction, but with
risk factors that have been associated with VA and SCD (including
LGE on CMR, pathogenic mutations in PLN, FLNC, RBM20, unexplained syncope, and inducibility of SMVT), are lacking. [129][,][641][,][643][,][644][,][659][–][662] Given the limitation of LVEF as the only
risk marker in DCM/HNDCM, this panel of experts shares the
opinion that in the presence of a combination of risk markers an

ICD should be considered.

7.1.3.1.3. Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death and
management of ventricular arrhythmias. Three randomized trials
(AVID, CASH, and CIDS) have compared ICD therapy and medical
treatment for secondary prevention in patients after aborted CA or
not-tolerated VT. [349][,][351][,][352] The three trials enrolled a total of 1963

patients, of whom only 292 (14.8%) had non-ischaemic aetiologies. A
significant reduction in death from any cause in patients with ICDs
was demonstrated, which was almost entirely due to a 50% reduction in arrhythmic death. [352] In the subgroup of patients with cardiomyopathies there was a similar but non-significant trend in the
reduction of death. [352] RCTs have excluded patients with haemodynamically tolerated VT. In DCM patients the VT substrate is less
well defined, and disease progression needs to be considered.
Therefore, despite the lack of data, this panel of experts shares the
opinion that an ICD should also be considered in DCM patients
with haemodynamically tolerated VT.
Optimization of ICD programming (see Section 6.2.3.1) can reduce ICD shocks delivered in response to VT, but additional therapy
to reduce symptomatic VA episodes is often required. In the OPTIC
trial, 412 patients with ICD implantation within 21 days of VT/VF
were randomized to amiodarone plus beta-blockers, sotalol alone,
or beta-blocker alone. ICD shock rates after one year were 10.3%,
24.3%, and 38.5%, respectively. The higher efficacy of amiodarone
plus beta-blockers compared to sotalol needs to be weighed against
the higher rate of medication-related adverse events on an individual
basis. [318] Although only limited data are available, sodium channel
blockers may control VT in SHD and may be beneficial in ICD recipients without advanced heart failure. The majority of SMVT is due
to scar-related re-entry, which can be targeted by catheter ablation.
Acute ablation outcome has been reported to be similar for CAD
and DCM. [497][,][663] However, VT recurrence rates are usually higher
in DCM patients (VT-free survival 40.5% in DCM vs. 57% in CAD
at 1 year). [497] After multiple procedures in 36% of the patients, long
term freedom of VT could be achieved in 69% of cases in a retro
spective, single-centre cohort of 282 patients treated between
1999 and 2014. [664]

–
Epicardial ablation is needed in 27 30% of the procedures. [497][,][664]

Outcome is particularly poor, and bailout strategies (transcoronary


ethanol ablation, bipolar ablation, surgical ablation) may be required in patients with pathogenic mutations (LMNA gene) and
in those with deep intramural, anteroseptal substrate locations. [499][,][665][,][666] Considering the complexity of the ablation procedure, DCM patients should therefore be treated only in
specialized centres.

7.1.3.2. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
ARVC is an inherited disease characterized by fibrofatty myocardial
replacement. [670] The prevalence ranges from 1:1000 to 1:5000 individuals, with male predominance among probands. [671] Patients with
SCD/VF at first presentation are typically younger (median age 23

–

[range 13 57]) compared to those who present with a SMVT

–
(median age 36 years [range 14 78]). [672]

ARVC is caused by pathogenic mutations in desmosomal genes
and less commonly in non-desmosomal genes. Genetic testing is indicated and identification of a mutation (in up to 73% of probands) is
a major criterion for the diagnosis. [116][,][671] In 4–16% compound/
digenic mutations are found, which have been associated with an increased risk of VA at younger age. [672][,][673] The disease penetrance in

–
first-degree relatives is 28 58%, [674][,][675] supporting regular clinical

evaluation of relatives.


ARVC is characterized by a predominant RV involvement. The
2010 revised international diagnostic task force criteria are based
on a multiparametric strategy [116] (Figure 21). Tissue characterization
by CMR was not included. However, RV fatty infiltration and LV LGE
are frequently observed (in 29–53% and 35.5–45% of probands, respectively) and may be present before patients meet major task force
imaging criteria. [676][–][678] Both wall motion alterations and pre-/
post-contrast signal abnormalities have been suggested to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of CMR for ARVC. [679] The identifi
cation of biventricular and left-dominant involvement in ARVC
patients [680][,][681] has recently led to the proposed term ‘arrhythmo
’
genic cardiomyopathy . [682]

Restriction from high-intensity exercise is regarded as a preventive
tool in clinically affected ARVC patients to reduce the risk of VAs and
disease progression. [683][–][685] Whether sport restriction is beneficial in
all mutation carriers without disease expression has not been evaluated in prospective cohorts, but avoidance of competitive, highintensity exercise seems to be reasonable. [686][,][687] SCD and VA occur
disproportionately during exercise in affected patients, and
high-dose isoproterenol infusion may provoke PVT in .90% of
ARVC patients, supporting the role of sympathetic stimulation for
arrhythmogeneity. [152][,][688][,][689] Whether beta-blockers can prevent
spontaneous VA is, however, unclear. Limited data suggest a potential beneficial role of atenolol. [690]

7.1.3.2.1. Risk stratification. In ARVC patients not implanted with

–
ICDs, CA occurs in 4.6 6.1%, while 23% of patients experience a

–
non-fatal SMVT during an average follow-up of 8 11 years. [691][–][694]

Whether a SMVT is acutely life-threatening depends on the VT cycle
length, cardiac function, and the circumstances under which VT occurs. Among definite/probable ARVC patients considered at high risk

–
for VA, 23 48% will experience appropriate ICD intervention during

–
a mean follow-up of 4.7 years. In 16 19% of cases, ICD intervention
is triggered by fast VT ≥250 b.p.m. or VF, which is considered as surrogate for a life-threatening event. [695][–][698] In a large cohort of 864
ARVC patients (38.8% with a prior VA), 43% had VT/VF during a median follow-up of 5.75 years, but only 10.8% a potentially lifethreatening event. Thus, in 3 out of 4 ARVC patients, ICD therapy
is appropriate but may not be considered acutely life-saving. This is
relevant because risk prediction algorithms and models are based
on combined arrhythmic endpoints, which are often equated with
ICD indications to prevent SCD. This is particularly important for
the young ARVC patients with a lifetime risk of ICD-related
complications. [695][,][699]

Randomized studies of ICD therapy for secondary prevention are
lacking, but the high rates of appropriate ICD therapy triggered by
fast VT/VF episodes in patients implanted after CA or haemodynamically poorly tolerated VT strongly suggest a survival benefit from
ICD. [700] In patients who present with a haemodynamically tolerated
VT, the survival benefit from ICD is less clear. [691][,][700][–][702] Identification
of ARVC patients at risk for SCD is difficult, and the evidence supporting risk factors for life-threatening VAs is limited. Arrhythmic
syncope was a predictor for subsequent events in most series of patients with definitive ARVC (pooled HR 3.67; CI 2.75–
4.9) [81][,][696][,][701][,][703] and, in these patients, an ICD should be considered.
RV and LV dysfunction have been associated with a higher arrhythmic risk. [675][,][704] Cut-off values are difficult to determine but, in

ESC Guidelines 4059

resonance; ECG, electrocardiogram; LBBB, left bundle branch block; RV, right ventricle; VT, ventricular tachycardia.


patients with severe RV dysfunction (RV fractional area change ≤17%
or RV ejection fraction ≤35%), an ICD should be considered.
Likewise, ARVC patients with significant LV involvement (LVEF
≤ 35%) should be treated according to the current DCM recommendation regarding ICD implantation. There are conflicting data
on the independent predictive value of NSVT for subsequent sustained arrhythmic events. [695][,][696][,][701] Likewise, the role of PES in risk
stratification, particularly in asymptomatic patients, is not well defined. [695][,][696][,][705] In one series including mainly symptomatic patients,
both NSVT and a positive PES independently predicted arrhythmic
events, while others report a low diagnostic accuracy. [696] Risk prediction based on a single parameter does not consider the potential

combined effect and interactions between factors. Therefore,


although supporting data are lacking, this panel of experts supports
that an ICD should be considered [706] in symptomatic ARVC patients
with moderate RV (,40%) and/or LV dysfunction (,45%) and who
have either NSVT or have SMVT inducible at PES. An internally validated risk model has recently been developed from 528 patients
with definite ARVC and no prior VA, including age, sex, arrhythmic
syncope, NSVT, PVC burden, leads with T-wave inversion and RV
ejection fraction, to predict any sustained VA (c-index 0.77). [81] In addition, a prediction model for specifically life-threatening VA has been
promoted based on 864 ARVC patients, with predictors including
male sex, age, 24 h PVC count, and leads with T-wave inversion
(c-index 0.74). [702] However, validation studies are needed before these

risk models can be recommended for clinical use.

4060 ESC Guidelines


7.1.3.2.2. Treatment. Up to 97.4% of all VA episodes in ARVC ICD
recipients are SMVT. The very high termination rate by ATP (92% of
all episodes) independent from VT cycle length strongly supports devices with the capability for ATP. [698] S-ICDs reduce lead-related
complications and have been proven to effectively shock terminate
VA in small cohorts of ARVC patients during short-term
follow-up. [707]

Additional treatment to supress VA is often required. Although
not confirmed by clinical data, beta-blockers are recommended as
first-line therapy in symptomatic patients.
Data on AADs to prevent VT recurrence are limited to small observational studies and registries. In general, AAD therapy has limited
efficacy. Although sotalol was effective to prevent inducibility of
VT, [708] it did not supress clinically relevant arrhythmias. [690][,][708]

Treatment with amiodarone or class 1 drugs was associated with a
trend to lower VT recurrence as compared with sotalol. [709] The addition of flecainide to beta-blockers/sotalol was beneficial in a small cohort. [710] Catheter ablation provides an alternative. Endocardial and
adjuvant epicardial substrate ablation, if needed, has been associated
with promising VT-free survival. Potential procedural risks, drug side
effects, and the patient’s preference need to be taken into
consideration. [482]

7.1.3.3. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
HCM is characterized by increased LV wall thickness not explained
by abnormal loading conditions (such as hypertension or valvular disease). [128][,][715] Because the natural history and management differs according to the underlying aetiology of LVH, diagnostic work-up is of
paramount importance (see Section 7.1.3.5) and includes CMR and
genetic testing. [716][–][725] HCM is usually caused by a mutation with
autosomal dominant inheritance, supporting cardiac screening in
first-degree relatives, in parallel with genetic testing in the index patient. A sarcomeric gene mutation is identified in 30–60%, most frequently in patients who are younger at diagnosis or with a family
history of HCM. [646][,][722]

The estimated prevalence of HCM in adults is 1 in 500. [726] In children, the prevalence is much lower.

ESC Guidelines 4061


Annual mortality related to HCM is 1–2% in most studies with
contemporary management strategies, [128][,][715] and may be as low
as 0.5%. [727] The annual rate of SCD or appropriate ICD therapy
is about 0.8% but is largely dependent on age and risk profile. [85][,][728][–][730] HCM patients are at risk for heart failure, AF, and
stroke. [128][,][715] Most HCM-related deaths at age ≤60 years occur
suddenly, while older patients die more often of stroke or heart
failure. [731] SCD is often related to VA, which can be a consequence
of ischaemia, left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, or
supraventricular arrhythmias. SCD may also be triggered by exercise, and participation in competitive sport has been discouraged. [732] However, recent data suggest that even vigorous


exercise in HCM patients without risk markers may not be associated with VA. [733][,][734]

7.1.3.3.1. Risk stratification and primary prevention of sudden cardiac death. In primary prevention, the challenge remains to identify
the relatively small group of patients with the highest risk of SCD.
NSVT is identified on continuous (24/48h) ambulatory ECG monitor
–
ing in 20 25% of patients. [128][,][715] Its prevalence increases with age
and correlates with LV wall thickness and LGE on CMR. [716][–][721][,][735]

The prognostic value of NSVT for SCD is more important in young
patients (,30 years). [735] The relation between the duration, frequency, or rate of NSVT and HCM prognosis remains unclear. [735]

magnetic resonance; ECG, electrocardiogram; LGE, late gadolinium enhancement; LV, left ventricular; RBBB, right bundle branch block; VT,
ventricular tachycardia.

4062 ESC Guidelines


Documented NSVT during exercise test is very rare, but was associated with a higher risk of SCD. [732] Additional risk factors have been
identified and a 5-year SCD risk stratification score based on seven
factors (age, LV wall thickness, LA size, LVOT gradient, NSVT, unexplained syncope, and family history of SCD) has been developed [85]

[(HCM Risk-SCD: https://doc2do.com/hcm/webHCM.html) and ex-](https://doc2do.com/hcm/webHCM.html)
ternally validated. [85][,][728][,][729] The calculator is not intended for use in
elite athletes, or in individuals with metabolic or infiltrative diseases,
or after myectomy or alcohol septal ablation. [85]

Additional factors not captured by the Risk-SCD model should
also be considered in patients with intermediate or low calculated
risk, including LV systolic dysfunction, apical aneurysm, extensive
LGE on CMR, and presence of single or multiple sarcomeric mutations (Figure 22). [716][,][717][,][722][,][736][–][739] Extensive LGE on CMR defined
as ≥15% of LV mass has been suggested as good predictor of
SCD in adults. However, thresholds may be difficult to use because
LGE quantification is dependent on CMR acquisition, type, and

amount of contrast.

Periodic reassessment is mandatory as part of the longitudinal
evaluation of patients. VA induced by PES is considered non-specific,
although conflicting results have been reported. [740][,][741]

In children few data on primary prevention were available until the
recent development of scores and related risk calculators. [83][,][84] The
HCM Risk-Kids score [84] has been developed and externally validated [742] specifically in children with HCM (1–16 years of age) and
includes unexplained syncope, maximal LV wall thickness, large left
[atrial diameter, low LVOT gradient, and NSVT (https://hcmriskkids.](https://hcmriskkids.org)
[org). In contrast to adults, including age and family history of SCD](https://hcmriskkids.org)
did not improve the performance of the paediatric model. Patients
with prior VF or sustained VT, known inborn errors of metabolism,
and syndromic causes of HCM were excluded. The predictive value
of LGE in children is less defined, although preliminary data were
reported. [743]

7.1.3.3.2. Treatment to prevent ventricular arrhythmia recurrence. Patients surviving a CA due to VT/VF or haemodynamically
not-tolerated VT remain at high risk for future life-threatening VA,
and will benefit from ICD therapy. [128][,][744][–][746]

There are no RCTs in HCM or cohort studies supporting a
significant role of drugs to prevent SCD. [128][,][715][,][747] Amiodarone
may reduce VA but with conflicting results regarding SCD prevention. [747][,][748] Disopyramide and beta-blockers are efficient to control
symptoms and LVOT obstruction, but there is no evidence that
they reduce the risk of SCD. [128][,][715] Similarly, surgical myectomy or

alcohol ablation are not recommended with the aim to reduce risk
of SCD in patients with LVOT obstruction. [128][,][715] Following ICD implantation for primary or secondary prevention, the most common
documented VA subtype is SMVT, and ATP is successful in 69–76.5%
of all episodes. [749][–][751] Although data on drug efficacy are lacking,
AADs (beta-blockers, amiodarone, sotalol, sodium channel blockers)
should be considered in HCM patients with symptomatic VA.
Catheter ablation may also be considered in highly selected HCM pa
tients with SMVT, in whom AADs are ineffective, contraindicated or

not tolerated, as outcome after ablation is inferior compared to
other non-ischaemic aetiologies. [752][–][754]

7.1.3.4. Left ventricular non-compaction
LVNC comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases. The diagnosis is
challenging, and various diagnostic criteria have been proposed. The
yield of genetic tests in index patients is low. [755]

The morphological phenotype of non-compaction based on imaging parameters may also appear in a healthy population. [756]

A meta-analysis including 2501 LVNC patients revealed a risk of
cardiovascular mortality similar to that of DCM patients, with no relation to the extent of trabeculation. [757] CMR-based detection of fo
cal fibrosis using LGE in LVNC with preserved ejection was
associated with serious cardiac events (aborted death, ICD therapy,
heart transplantation [HTX]/LVAD) in another meta-analysis including 574 patients (OR 6.1; CI 2.1–17.5; P, 0.001). [758] A combination
of CMR criteria with systematic genotyping may overcome current
uncertainties regarding risk stratification. [759]

Recommendation Table 31 — Recommendations for
implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation in
left ventricular non-compaction


Heart failure is one of the leading symptoms in primary and secondary RCM. [760]

In Fabry disease the majority of the reported cardiovascular
deaths have been categorized as SCD in a recent systematic review
of 13 studies including 4185 patients. [761] Higher age, male gender,
LVH, LGE, and NSVT have been identified as potential risk factors
associated with SCD events. However, SCD rates were reported
in only 11 of the studies, including 623 patients. The retrospective,
observational nature of most of these small, single-centre studies
and the low absolute number of cardiovascular deaths (36/623)
and SCD (30/623) do not currently allow guidance for primary prevention ICD implantation. [761]

Amyloidosis can be caused by different misfolded precursor proteins leading to deposits in tissue and organs. Cardiac amyloidosis is
mainly related to light-chain amyloid or transthyretin amyloid. The
latter can be subdivided into wild-type, also called senile amyloid,
more often complicated by AV conduction delay and atrial arrhythmias, and amyloid due to pathogenic mutations in the TTR gene.
Disease manifestation depends on the mutation. Despite advances
in the treatment of amyloid light-chain amyloidosis, outcome is still
poor in patients with manifest cardiac involvement. [762] Causes of
death are progressive heart failure, autonomic dysfunction, and
electromechanical dissociation. [762][,][763] The benefit of primary prevention ICD implantation in patients with cardiac amyloidosis is uncertain. Currently, an ICD should be considered in patients with
haemodynamically not-tolerated VT after careful discussion of
the competing risks of non-arrhythmic death and non-cardiac

death.

7.1.3.6. Neuromuscular disorders

An algorithm for risk stratification, SCD prevention, and treatment
of VAs in myotonic dystrophy is presented in Figure 23.
Arrhythmias are common and often the first manifestation of
neuromuscular disorders. [764] Myotonic dystrophy is the most common
muscular dystrophy in the adult population (prevalence 1 in 8000).
Myotonic dystrophy is the consequence of trinucleotide repeat expansion in the end of DMPK gene, which results in mis-splicing of SCN5A
and cardiac conduction system delays and arrhythmia. Duchenne dystrophy also has a high incidence (1 in 3500 male births). As most patients die before the age of 20, it is rarely seen in adulthood. Other
neuromuscular disorders, such as Becker (1 in 100000 male births)
and facioscapulohumeral (1 in 100000) dystrophies, are less common.
Most of these disorders are associated with conduction and rhythm

disturbances, some life-threatening, and with mechanisms amenable to
specific anti-arrhythmic therapy. [17] Anti-arrhythmic therapy should be
considered, as muscular function and life expectancy are often only
moderately limited. [765] It is generally recommended to treat patients

with neuromuscular diseases who have survived a CA or have VAs

or ventricular dysfunction in the same way as patients without extracardiac manifestations. However, the benefit of ICD implantation
should be balanced with the overall prognosis in some subtypes,
such as Duchenne dystrophy.
Symptoms may be the result of bradycardia or tachyarrhythmias and invasive electrophysiological evaluation is warranted


unless a cause, such as AV block, has been clinically documented. [153] Sudden increase of PR interval and QRS duration have

been associated with AV block and SCD in myotonic dystrophy
despite the absence of symptoms, and electrophysiological evaluation should be considered. [766][,][767] An HV interval ≥70 ms should

prompt pacemaker implantation regardless of symptoms.
Induction of BBR-VT in a symptomatic patient strongly supports
BBR-VT ( [ESC CardioMed chapter 42.5)](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0537) [768] as an underlying
cause of symptoms, and ablation of the right bundle branch is recommended. [153] Following bundle branch ablation, the risk of AV
block at follow-up is considered particularly high due to

ESC Guidelines 4065


–
progressive His Purkinje disease, and a pacemaker should be implanted. Prolonged PR or QRS intervals, [13][,][16][,][80] concurrent atrial
arrhythmias, [6][,][16][,][80] and LGE at CMR [14][,][15][,][18] in patients older than
40 years have all been associated with AV block and SCD at
follow-up in myotonic dystrophy. Accordingly, pacemaker implantation may be considered even in the absence of symptoms.
Although data are lacking, implantation of an ICD rather than a
pacemaker may be preferred in myotonic dystrophy patients,
with additional risk factors for VA and SCD (Figure 23).
Permanent pacemaker implantation may also be considered in
patients with Kearns–Sayre syndrome, Emery–Dreiffus, or
limb–girdle muscular dystrophy with any degree of AV block because of the substantial risk of rapid progression to total block.
In patients with limb–girdle type 1B or Emery–Dreifuss muscular
dystrophies who have an indication for pacing or significant LGE
on CMR, ICD implantation should be considered. [769]

Implantation of an ICD rather than a pacemaker may be also considered in patients with Duchenne/Becker, when there is significant
LGE on CMR. [770][,][771] However, the general prognosis of these diseases should be taken into consideration. In patients who have survived a CA due to a SMVT, implantation of an ICD is recommended
when other than BBR-VTs (e.g. scar-related VTs) are inducible or if
VT is not inducible. Myotonic dystrophy patients with a syncope likely due to a VA, even if not inducible, and those with palpitations and
induction of a non-BBR-VT are considered at risk for arrhythmic

SCD, and ICDs should be considered.

Due to the progressive nature, annual follow-up with an ECG is
recommended, even in the concealed phase of the disease when patients are asymptomatic and the ECG is normal. [6][,][13] Due to slow progression and the fact that significant changes are often reflected on
the surface ECG, serial electrophysiological evaluation to assess
AV conduction and arrhythmia induction is not recommended in patients without arrhythmia suspicion or progression of ECG conduction disorders. [767][,][772]

7.1.4. Inflammatory cardiac diseases
Cardiac inflammation has been associated with altered myocardial
electrical properties and arrhythmias, and has been reported in various cardiomyopathies such as, obviously, myocarditis, but also inherited cardiomyopathies or after MI. [773][,][774]

Inflammatory cardiomyopathies are characterized by myocardial
inflammation (i.e. myocarditis) as the primary cause of cardiac damage, whereas secondary myocardial inflammations are caused by an
initial myocardial pathology. [775][,][776]

Myocarditis, sarcoidosis, and Chagas’ disease are among the major
entities within inflammatory cardiomyopathies.

7.1.4.1. Myocarditis
The diagnosis of myocarditis can be challenging. There is no pathognomonic clinical presentation of this disease, [777] with cardiac manifestations ranging from subtle symptoms to severe heart failure,
complete AV block, and SCD. [778] In young people, it is estimated
that 2–12% of SCD are related to myocarditis. [779][–][781]

Myocarditis is diagnosed on endomyocardial biopsy by established
histological, immunological, and immunohistochemical criteria, as
well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral genomes. [782][,][783] This implies that endomyocardial biopsy, although not
widely used, is the diagnostic gold standard for myocarditis. [778][,][784]

In current practice, the diagnosis of myocarditis relies on clinical
presentation, elevated troponin level, ECG changes, evidence of LV
dysfunction, absence of significant CAD or valvular heart disease,
and suggestive findings on CMR or PET-CT.
In the context of suspected or confirmed acute myocarditis, patients with a life-threatening presentation (fulminant myocarditis,
sustained VAs, or complete AV block) are to be referred to a specialized centre. [785][,][786] A specialized centre must have the capacity to
perform cardiac catheterization, endomyocardial biopsies, use
mechanical circulatory support devices, and manage complex VAs.
Sustained VAs may occur in acute myocarditis. In a large series of
patients, [786] in-hospital VF or CA was reported in 2.5% of cases. In
another series of acute myocarditis in children, [787] sustained tachyarrhythmias were reported in 11.5% of patients, with VAs accounting
for most cases (79.5%). Tachyarrhythmias were associated with a
2.3-fold increased risk of death. [787] Giant cell myocarditis, although
rare, has a higher risk of life-threatening VAs, which are seen in
14% of giant cell myocarditis patients on initial presentation, and
then develop as refractory arrhythmias in more than half of the patients during the course of the disease. [788][,][789]

The management of acute myocarditis depends on clinical presentation, viral PCR from myocardial biopsies, and histological findings.
In patients with suspected myocarditis who present with mild heart

failure, it is recommended to avoid exercise and use beta-blockers
and ACE inhibitors. [790] Patients with VAs or AV block must be admit
ted to the hospital and continuously monitored.
Treatment of arrhythmias in patients with inflammatory heart disease does not differ from generally accepted clinical principles.
Symptomatic VAs may require AADs such as amiodarone and/or
beta-blockers. [791][–][793] Of note, in a retrospective observational study,
patients with sustained VAs during the acute phase of myocarditis
(LVEF 53 + 10%) had a high risk (45% at 3 years) of VT/VF recurrences during follow-up. [794]

Myocarditis may resolve without sequelae, recur, or become
chronic. Thus, myocarditis is often considered a precursor of


DCM. [795] Development of DCM has been observed in 21% of patients with acute myocarditis over a mean follow-up period of 3
years. [796] The exact proportion of chronic DCM consecutive to
the progression of acute myocarditis remains unknown, but myocarditis has been identified as the cause of DCM in up to 12% of cases in
a large retrospective study. [797] In patients with SMVT of unclear aetiology, myocarditis should be suspected especially when CMR reveals
subepicardial and/or intramural abnormal fibrotic myocardial tissue.
The presence of LGE at CMR has also been associated with the late
occurrence of VAs in patients with endomyocardial biopsy-proven
viral myocarditis. [798][–][800]

The management of documented VAs in chronic myocarditis is
similar to that of patients with DCM, including ICD implantation

and the use of AADs. Catheter ablation can be effective to treat

SMVT, the arrhythmogenic substrate of which is often found on
the epicardium of the lateral/basal left ventricle. [752][,][801][–][803] In one
publication, [802] non-inducibility of VT after catheter ablation led to
avoidance of ICD implantation in one-third of patients, with subsequently no VT recurrence during follow-up.

7.1.4.2. Cardiac sarcoidosis

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown cause,
with a genetic predisposition, [807] characterized by the accumulation
of T lymphocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, and non-caseating
granulomas leading to tissue scarring. [808] Although lung involvement
is most frequent, any organ can be affected. It is estimated that 5% of
patients with sarcoidosis have symptoms indicative of cardiac involvement. However, using advanced cardiac imaging modalities
(CMR/PET-CT), subclinical cardiac sarcoidosis is increasingly diagnosed. [808][–][811]

The diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis is challenging. It can mimic the
ARVC phenotype in the event of a predominant RV involvement [810]

or the heart is the only organ affected by sarcoidosis (so-called ‘isolated cardiac sarcoidosis’). [812] Cardiac electroanatomical voltage
mapping may help in the differential diagnosis between isolated cardiac sarcoidosis and ARVC. [813] The three usual cardiac manifestations

of cardiac sarcoidosis are LV dysfunction, AV conduction abnormalities, and VAs. Complete AV block develops primarily during the
acute inflammatory phase as opposed to sustained VT, which frequently develops in the advanced stage of the disease (Figure 24). [814]

In addition to isolated cardiac sarcoidosis, [812] three independent

factors have been found associated with an adverse outcome and,
particularly, the risk of VAs: (i) an LVEF,35% [812] ; (ii) documentation
of high-degree AV block [815][,][816] ; and (iii) presence of RV or LV scarring
at CMR (Figure 25). [817][–][821] However, VAs and SCD may occur in patients with a mildly reduced or normal LVEF. PES, [822][–][825] PET-CT, [826]

and LGE-CMR help stratify the risk of VAs in such patients. [827] In a
series of 120 patients with biopsy-proven extracardiac sarcoidosis
and preserved LV/RV systolic function, VT inducibility at PES was
low (6%) but associated with the composite endpoint of VAs and
SCD, which occurred in 3 patients, all with abnormal PET or CMR
(P = 0.009). [825] In a cohort of 66 asymptomatic patients with biopsyproven extracardiac sarcoidosis and abnormal PET-CT or CMR, 8
(11%) were inducible at PES and 6 of 8 had VA or died during followup, compared to 1 of 68 non-inducible patients (P, 0.0001). Of
note, inducible patients had a lower LVEF at PES, which further deteriorated at 2-year follow-up. [823]

The benefit of ICDs, both for primary and secondary prevention, has
been reported. [828][–][832] Data support the use of ICDs for primary prevention of SCD in patients with LVEF ≤35%. [812][,][830] In addition,


whatever the LVEF, ICD should also be considered in patients with
anindication for permanent cardiacpacingor the presence of significant
scaratCMR. [833][,][834] Indeed,asshownintworecent meta-analyses, [821][,][832]

the occurrence of VA is higher in patients with complete AV block (OR
= 2.19; P, 0.01), and the presence of scar at CMR is associated with a
higher risk of the composite endpoint of ventricular arrhythmic events
and mortality (OR = 10.74; P, 0.00001). A widely accepted definition
of significant LGE is not available. LGE in ≥9/29 segments (17 LV and 12
RV segments) and LGE affecting ≥22% of the LV mass have been associated with arrhythmic endpoints. [820][,][827][,][835]

Corticosteroid therapy is a mainstay of cardiac sarcoidosis

treatment, but the effect of this treatment on the occurrence of
VAs has only been ascertained from observational studies. [836][–][838]

Obviously, based upon pathophysiology of the disease, inflammation plays a role in the development of ventricular scar in patients

with cardiac sarcoidosis. However, so far there is no evidence that
VAs are directly triggered by active inflammation itself. Indeed, a
scar-related intramural or epicardial substrate (with a predilection
in peri-valvular regions) explains most VTs in patients with cardiac
sarcoidosis. [839] The VT substrate was more likely located in segments with scar transmurality at CMR and a lower degree of inflammation on PET-scan. [840] Catheter ablation may help to
prevent VT, [839][,][841][,][842] in particular if AAD treatment fails, [837] but
VT recurrences are still frequent, [752][,][839] in particular if catheter ablation is performed during active inflammation, with AADs continued in many patients. [839][,][843]

Trypanosoma cruzi, is the most common cause of non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy in Latin America. After the incubation period, the vast
majority of infected persons have minor or no symptoms, and very
few (,1%) develop acute myocarditis. [845] However, people are in
–
fected for life, and years to decades after the initial infection 20
30% of them will develop cardiomyopathy, [846] which can lead to
heart failure, heart block and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.
SCD, particularly due to VF, is the most common cause of death
in patients with Chagas’ cardiomyopathy. [847][,][848] A risk score developed by Rassi et al. [849] as well as the presence of myocardial fibrosis
at LGE-CMR [850] are useful in assessing the risk of death in Chagas’ disease patients. However, whether such risk stratification can translate
into clinical benefit through ICD treatment needs to be assessed in
prospective trials, also considering the high annual mortality in
Chagas patients with ICDs. [851]

Although ICD implantation may seem reasonable for the secondary prevention of SCD in patients with Chagas’ cardiomyopathy,
there are controversial studies [851][–][856] about the benefits and risks

of ICD implantation in these patients. Indeed, a meta-analysis of observational studies found no benefit of ICD (n = 483) vs. amiodarone
(n = 115) for the secondary prevention of SCD in patients with
Chagas’ disease as all-cause annual mortality rates were comparable
in both groups (9.7% and 9.6%, respectively). [856] Another
meta-analysis found a 4.7% annual incidence of inappropriate shocks


and a high 9.0% annual mortality rate in 1041 ICD patients with
Chagas’ disease. [851]

Amiodarone [857] and catheter ablation [858][–][860] have been successful
ly used to control recurrent VAs in some patients. As with various
forms of myocarditis, the arrhythmogenic substrate is often found
at the epicardium in Chagas’ cardiomyopathy.

7.1.5. Valvular heart disease

Valvular heart diseases predispose to SCD both in the preoperative period and after valvular surgery. In old cohorts of symptomatic, non-operated patients with severe aortic stenosis or severe mitral regurgitation, the incidence of SCD was 50–60%. In
these studies, the rate of SCD secondary to VA was not
specified. [861][,][862]

Rates of SCD in patients with prosthetic valves range from 15%
to 30%, with an estimated annual risk of 0.2–0.9%. [863] In a large series of 1533 patients who underwent aortic or mitral valve replacement, 6% of deaths were caused by arrhythmias. [864] A recent
report of 3726 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) showed 5.6% SCD during 22 months of followup, emphasizing the remaining SCD risk also after valve
replacement. [865]

Small observational studies have shown that patients with residual
LV dysfunction after valvular surgery who undergo ICD implantation
have appropriate therapy and mortality rates similar to patients with
ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. [866][–][868] ICD implantation in
these patients should therefore follow DCM/HNDCM

recommendations.

In patients after TAVI, SCD has been associated with the presence of new-onset conduction disturbances (LBBB, QRS .
160 ms) and reduced LVEF ≤40%. [865] SCD in these patients may
be the consequence of advanced AV block, and permanent pacing
indication should follow the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiac pacing
and cardiac resynchronization therapy. [2] The role of ICD implantation for prevention of SCD after TAVI is less clear. Two recent
retrospective analyses including a total of 203 patients in whom


the LVEF remained ≤35% did not show survival benefit from
ICD implantation, probably related to the high competing risk of

death from heart failure and relevant comorbidities in this
population. [869][,][870]

In patients presenting with SMVT after aortic valve replacement,
PES is indicated because of the high probability of BBR-VT as the

—
underlying mechanism an arrhythmia that is potentially curable
with catheter ablation. [871][,][872]

–
SCD has been reported to occur in 0.2 0.4% of patients with MVP
per year. [873][,][874] However, the total number of patients dying suddenly with this condition is most likely underestimated, considering that
it is a common valve variant with an estimated prevalence of 2–3% in
the general population. [875]

Using rigorous criteria for morphologic diagnosis (i.e. myxomatous mitral valve) at post-mortem, MVP has been associated with
7% of all cases of juvenile SCD in the Registry of the Veneto region
of Italy. [228] Recent pathological and clinical studies on SCD victims
with MVP or patients with MVP and major VAs have provided insights into the potential VA substrate. [130][,][228][,][876][–][880] In particular,
myocardial fibrosis affecting both the infero-basal LV free wall and
the papillary muscles has been recognized in pathological and
LGE-CMR studies. [228] The scarring process has been related to
mechanical stretch secondary to the excessive mobility of the mitral
valve apparatus due to mitral valvular disjunction and posterior systolic curling. [876] This indicates a promising role of CMR for arrhythmic risk stratification beyond traditional electrophysiological

markers.

Proposed criteria for an ‘arrhythmic MVP syndrome’ that have
been associated with an increased risk for SCD include: young
adults (most often women), QTc prolongation and/or negative
T-wave in inferior ECG leads, mitral annular disjunction, bi-leaflet
involvement on echocardiography, frequent PVCs, or nonsustained PVT on Holter monitoring and/or exercise testing. [130][,][228][,][876][–][880] Reduced LVEF and/or myocardial fibrosis on
CMR may add to the risk profile. These data are mainly derived
from small retrospective series of SCD survivors and post-mortem
studies. Therefore, identification of the small subgroup of patients
at risk of SCD remains challenging. [228][,][874] Robust data to support
recommendations for risk stratification of SCD in patients with

MVP are not available.

7.1.6. Congenital heart disease
Advances in surgical repair and medical treatment have improved the
long-term prognosis of children born with congenital heart disease
(CHD). More than 90% now survive to adulthood, [882] and consequently
the prevalence of adult CHD has steadily increased. [883] With fewer patients dying from peri-operative events and early heart failure, SCD has
become a leading cause of death in adults with repaired CHD. [884] The


combination of surgical incisions, myocardial scar and residual or new
anatomical abnormalities form the substrate for VAs (Figure 26).
Risk stratification for SCD in CHD patients and no documented
sustained VA remains difficult due to a mixed patient population,
the absence of RCTs, and relatively small observational studies. In patients with biventricular physiology and a systemic LV, the standard
criterion of an LVEF ≤35% is used for patient selection for primary
prevention ICD implantation. [885][,][886] For patients with unexplained
syncope, severe arrhythmia symptoms such as palpitations or presyncope and NSVT, PES should be considered. [887] In asymptomatic
patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) but other indicators for a
VA substrate, electrophysiological evaluation may refine risk stratification. [888] The surgical era and the techniques used affect the VA sub
strate and occurrence of VAs and should be considered. The use of a

transannular patch repair in TOF patients, for example, was found to
be associated with a lower risk for VA. [889] The benefit of primary prevention ICD therapy in patients with single or systemic RVs is less
well established and requires consideration of disease- and patientspecific factors. [890][,][891]

4072 ESC Guidelines


In CHD patients with sustained VA or CA survivors, a comprehensive evaluation of inciting factors, including cardiac imaging (particularly CMR) and haemodynamic assessment, is important
(Figure 26). [892] If pre-existing or new anatomical abnormalities requiring intervention are detected, the treatment plan should consider
pre- or intra-operative mapping and transection of the VT substrate,
because accessibility might be impaired post-operatively. [888][,][893][,][894]

Pre-operative evaluation and intervention are especially important
in TOF patients undergoing surgical pulmonary re-valving. In selected
patients with CHD (including those with atrial baffle repair for transposition of the great arteries, Fontan operation and Ebstein anomaly), evaluation and treatment of SVT (such as intra-atrial
re-entrant tachycardias or AV re-entrant tachycardias) with rapid
ventricular conduction should also be considered. [890][,][895][,][896]

In the absence of identifiable reversible factors, ICD implantation
for secondary prevention of SCD is recommended. [349][,][350] While
transvenous ICD systems have been most frequently used and
have the advantage of anti-tachycardia and anti-bradycardia pacing,
subcutaneous ICDs may be an alternative in selected patients with

limited venous access to the ventricle or with intracardiac shunts.

In CHD patients, MVT most often arises from re-entrant tachycardias using anatomical isthmuses bounded by valves, patch material, and surgical incisions. Early mapping and ablation studies,
particularly in TOF patients, identified critical anatomical isthmuses
of reproducible anatomical location. [897][,][898] Following this concept,

those anatomical isthmuses can be reconstructed and transected

in sinus rhythm during catheter ablation procedures using electroanatomical mapping systems, achieving acute success rates of
80%. [888][,][899][–][901] The use of conduction block across anatomical isth
muses as a procedural endpoint, in addition to non-inducibility of VT,
has further improved long-term ablation outcomes. [888][,][899]

Accordingly, catheter ablation is recommended in particular in
TOF patients with recurrent SMVT. Due to the complexity of
CHD patients as well as the VT substrate, those procedures should
be performed in centres with expertise in catheter ablation of CHD
patients. Catheter ablation may be considered in lieu of ICD implantation in selected TOF patients with SMVT and preserved biventricular function, provided the combined procedural endpoint of
non-inducibility and conduction block across the anatomical isthmus
can be reached. [888][,][899]

Isoproterenol, verapamil, or quinidine have been employed for acute
treatment of recurrent ICD discharges or electrical
storm. [912][,][913][,][918][,][922][–][926] In several small studies, quinidine was highly
effective in reducing or even preventing arrhythmia inducibility during programmed stimulation. [923][,][924][,][926] Moreover, a retrospective
study in 46 patients showed a reduction of mean ICD shocks from
7.5 per patient over 2.9 years to 0.9 shocks per patient over 3.7
years, with a decrease in ventricular storms from 36 to 3 after quinidine initiation. [922] In patients with recurrent episodes of VF triggered
by a similar PVC unresponsive to medical treatment, catheter ablation has shown success (Figure 28). [186][,][221][,][333][,][493][,][927][–][930] PVCs most
commonly originate from the Purkinje system and can be eliminated
with a high acute success rate of 87–100%. [186][,][221][,][333][,][493][,][927][–][930]

Detailed electroanatomic mapping may also reveal localized structural alterations (62.5% in one study). [248]

7.2. Primary electrical disease
7.2.1. Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation
The diagnosis of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) is made in
SCA survivors, preferably with documented VF, after exclusion of
structural, channelopathic, metabolic, or toxicological aetiologies. [135][,][222][,][911][–][913] Diagnostic tests include blood chemistry, ECG (including high lead), cardiac CT/coronary angiography, telemetry/
Holter, exercise stress test, echocardiogram, sodium-channel blocker testing and CMR (see Section 5.2.3, scenario 3). [135][,][222][,][911] Genetic
testing for channelopathy and cardiomyopathy genes may be considered with a mutation yield of 3–17%. [249][,][914][,][915] Clinical evaluation of
first-degree family members may be considered, but the diagnostic
yield is low. In particular the significance of detected early repolarization pattern (ERP) in asymptomatic relatives is uncertain. [182][,][916]

In IVF patients, ICD implantation reduces the risk of arrhythmic
death by up to 68% compared to amiodarone [352][,][917][–][921]

(Figure 27). In observational studies with a mean follow-up of 5–6

–
years, 21.0 29.6% of IVF patients experienced an arrhythmic recur
–
rence, corresponding to an annual ICD shock rate of 3.6 5.7%,
whereas 4.5–17.5% experienced inappropriate shocks. [919][–][921]

7.2.2. Long QT syndrome (including acquired long
QT syndrome)
LQTS is characterized by a prolonged QT interval and VAs mainly
triggered by adrenergic activation. The mean age at presentation is
14 years. The annual rate of SCD in asymptomatic patients with untreated LQTS has been estimated to be less than 0.5%, [82] while it increases to around 5% in those with history of syncope. [931]

Rare variants in 17 genes [932] have been associated with LQTS.
However, the causality for several of the identified genes has been
questioned. [166] The undisputed genes are those causing LQT1, LQT2
and LQTS3: KCNQ1, KCNH2 and SCN5A, respectively, with genespecific triggers being exercise (LQTS1), emotional stress (LQTS2)
and sleep (LQTS3). Genetic screening identifies a mutation in 75% of
LQTS cases and three main genes account for 90% of positively genotyped cases. [178] The subtypes of LQTS may be grouped as follows:

(1) Autosomal-dominant LQTS (prevalence: 1 in 2500) without

extra-cardiac manifestation.

(2) Autosomal-dominant LQTS with extra-cardiac manifestation,

comprising:


–
(a) Andersen Tawil Syndrome (LQT7), increasingly considered
its own entity. [933][,][934]

(b) Timothy Syndrome (LQT8), characterized by prolonged
QT, syndactyly, cardiac malformations, autism spectrum disorder and dysmorphism. [935]

(3) Autosomal-recessive LQTS (Jervell and Lange–Nielsen
Syndrome), combining extreme QT prolongation with congenital deafness. [936]

This panel of experts has confirmed the diagnostic criteria proposed in the previous version of the guidelines: a QTc ≥480 ms or
a LQTS risk score .3 [937] (Table 10) for clinical diagnosis (Figures
29 and 30). In the presence of arrhythmic syncope or CA, a QTc
≥460 ms is sufficient to consider a diagnosis of LQTS. A challenge
for the clinician is establishing the duration of the QT interval in patients with broad QRS complexes (e.g. in the presence of ventricular
pacing or ventricular conduction defects). In this setting, a formula
has been proposed that adjusts QT by QRS duration. [938] While
measuring the QT, the patient moving briskly from recumbent to

ESC Guidelines 4075

ventricular complex; VF, ventricular fibrillation.


orthostatic position may be helpful for the diagnosis of LQTS. [232][,][939]

Epinephrine challenge is not recommended as a routine diagnostic
tool, as reproducibility is modest. [137] Patients with a clinical diagnosis
of LQTS are recommended to undergo genetic counselling and testing in specialized centres to receive genotype-specific management
and permit identification of relatives at risk. Relatives with a mutation
but without QT prolongation still receive a diagnosis of LQTS, as
they are at risk of experiencing VA, although less frequently than
phenotype-positive patients. [940]

All LQTS patients receive advice on avoidance of hypokalaemia, QT-prolonging medications and genotype-specific triggers. [941][–][943] Beta-blockers are also recommended in all LQTS
patients. Non-selective beta-blockers nadolol and propranolol


have greater efficacy in reducing arrhythmic risk. [940][,][944][–][946]

Clinical, electrocardiographic and genetic parameters should be
considered for the individual risk estimation. [82] Recently, risk
stratification based on QT interval duration and genotype has
been integrated in a LQTS calculator (the 1-2-3 LQTS Risk
calculator). [947]

The utility of genetic testing is exemplified by the need to avoid
genotype-specific risks and by the use of mexiletine as a genotypespecific treatment for LQT3, which reduces the length of QT interval
and the number of arrhythmic events. [948] It should be noted that different mutations in SCN5A show different responses to mexiletine.
For example, selected mutations identified in patients not responding to mexiletine showed a distinctive electrophysiological profile

when studied in vitro. [949][,][950] Additionally, in the case of mutations that
cause overlapping syndromes, mexiletine does not induce ST segment elevation, while flecainide has been reported to do so. [951]


Given the uncertain role of beta-blockers in LQT3, there are no in
dications on whether mexiletine should be administered as a

stand-alone therapy or in combination with beta-blockers.
Considering that some mutations may not respond to mexiletine,
it is advisable to perform oral testing to verify that the QTc shortens
40 ms before prescribing chronic treatment. [948]

Survivors of a CA have a high risk of recurrences, even on betablockers (14% within 5 years on therapy), supporting the use of
ICD in CA survivors. [952] Moreover, ICD implantation is indicated
when a patient experiences syncope and/or VA despite optimal
pharmacological therapy, as syncopal events are associated with
increased risk of CA. [953][,][954] Women with LQTS, particularly
LQT2, have an increased risk of arrhythmia both during pregnancy
and especially first year post-partum. [955] Silent carriers of mutations present a low, but not negligible, risk of cardiac events, and
the use of beta-blockers should be considered in this group of
patients. [956]

Left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) is recommended for
symptomatic patients despite beta-blockers when ICD is contraindicated or declined, or for an ICD carrier who experiences multiple
shocks while on beta-blockers. This is supported by the evidence
that LCSD, especially when performed with a video-assisted technique, is safe and effective, [957] well-tolerated by patients [958] and
does not have a negative impact on cardiovascular performance. [959]

However, because complications do occur and half of the patients
experience breakthrough events after the procedure, LCSD is not
an alternative to ICD for high-risk patients. [960] Prophylactic ICD

7.2.3. Andersen–Tawil syndrome Type 1
Andersen–Tawil syndrome Type 1, also classified as LQT7, is a rare disease (1:1 000000) characterized by three main symptoms: frequent VA
(e.g. bidirectional VT), dysmorphologies and periodic paralysis. [964][–][967]

The inward rectifier current (I K1 ) decreased by KCNJ2 loss of function
mutation [968] causes an increase in U wave amplitude rather than QT
prolongation. [964][,][967][–][970] Syncope or documented VT is associated with
life-threatening VA, and a study found a 5-year probability of 7.9%
of life-threatening VA. [967] In patients with sustained haemodynamically not-tolerated VT or CA, an ICD is recommended. [964][,][967]

Flecainide and/or beta-blockers seem to reduce VA, [964][,][970][,][971]

whereas amiodarone may be proarrhythmic and should only be
used with an ICD. [967] In patients with syncope despite medical therapy, an ICD or ILR should be discussed. [967]

7.2.4. Brugada syndrome
The type 1 Brugada ECG pattern is characterized by J point elevation

of .2 mV with coved ST elevation and T wave inversion in at least

one right precordial ECG lead, V1 or V2, positioned in the second,
third or fourth intercostal spaces (Figure 32). It may occur either
spontaneously or be induced by exposure to sodium channelblocking drugs or fever. [135][,][231][,][973][–][978] It is mandatory to exclude
other conditions that may explain the type 1 pattern, so-called
phenocopies. [979]

BrS is diagnosed in patients without other heart disease and a
spontaneous type 1 pattern, regardless of symptoms, due to its
rarity in the general population and association with
risk. [231][,][979][,][980] The type 1 pattern may also be induced by administration of a sodium channel-blocking drug as a diagnostic test in
patients suspected to have concealed BrS but without a spontaneous type 1 ECG. [135][,][136][,][231][,][387][,][973][,][978][,][981][–][985] However, provocation with drug or fever is less specific than previously thought,
with 2–4% prevalence in healthy subjects and higher prevalence
in patients with AV nodal reentry tachycardia or an accessory
pathway in one study. [977][,][978][,][986] In the opinion of this panel of experts, an induced type 1 ECG pattern therefore requires other
clinical features, such as documented PVT/VF, arrhythmic syncope, or relevant family history.
The yield of genetic testing in BrS patients is approximately 20%,
with the SCN5A gene the only gene with evidence of association
for clinical testing purposes. [164][,][980] Phenotype and genotype mismatch is seen in SCN5A families, which is explained by variable effects
of mutation severity and a polygenic risk score derived from
genome-wide association studies. [170][,][979][,][987] Recent data also support
a potential for prognostication. [988][,][989]

Psychotropic drugs, selected AADs, anaesthetic agents, cocaine,
excessive alcohol intake and fever are potential triggers to exacerbate the type 1 pattern and trigger VF. [231][,][297] The risk of recurrent
VF among patients presenting with CA is 48% at 10 years. ICD implantation is therefore indicated in symptomatic BrS patients who
are survivors of CA or have documented spontaneous sustained
VA (Figure 33). [980][,][990][–][994] Approximately one-third of BrS patients
present with syncope. [995] The risk of arrhythmic events in BrS patients with unexplained syncope is 4 times higher than the risk in
asymptomatic patients. [155][,][990][–][992][,][994][,][996] Detailed patient history, including absence of prodrome or specific triggers, is essential for distinguishing arrhythmic from non-arrhythmic syncope. Nonetheless,
the aetiology of syncope is difficult to determine in up to 30% of
BrS patients. In small studies, arrhythmia detected by ILR changed

–
clinical management in 20 36% of the BrS patients with unexplained
syncope. [997][–][999]

Asymptomatic patients represent a majority of newly diagnosed
BrS patients with an incidence of arrhythmic events of 0.5% per
year. [1000][,][1001] Their risk stratification remains challenging. A spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern, as well as other ECG markers such as
early repolarization pattern and QRS fragmentation, have been associated with higher risk. [980][,][992][,][1002][,][1003] Some have been incorporated into risk scores, although their utility in intermediate-risk
patients remains low. [1004][,][1005] Electrophysiological studies remain
controversial. A multicentre pooled analysis showed that

induction of sustained VA during electrophysiological studies was
associated with a higher future risk of VA. [155] Inducibility, however, was associated with a potentially clinically actionable result
only in asymptomatic patients with a spontaneous type 1 Brugada
pattern ECG.
In case of recurrent ICD shocks for VF, quinidine or catheter ablation have been successful in reducing shock frequency. [922][,][1006][,][1007]

Isoproterenol infusion can suppress electrical storm. [1008] In several
small studies, quinidine was effective in reducing or even preventing
arrhythmia inducibility during programmed stimulation. [922][,][1006][,][1007]

However, adverse effects of quinidine can occur in up to 37% of patients, and quinidine is inaccessible in many countries. Cilostazol
(phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor) can be an alternative to quinidine. [1008] Electrophysiological mapping data linked to histopathological studies suggest that an abnormal fibrotic arrhythmogenic
substrate in the epicardial RVOT is responsible for the ST-segment
elevation in the right precordial leads and VF occurrence in BrS patients. [1009] Ablation of these abnormal areas can markedly suppress
recurrent VF and normalize the ECG in .75% of patients. [1009][–][1015]

In patients with recurrent episodes of VF triggered by a similar
PVC non-responsive to medical treatment, catheter ablation may
target the PVC, which most commonly originates from the RVOT
or Purkinje system. [1013] However, data regarding the long-term
follow-up after ablation are limited, with neither trial data nor evidence for ablation in asymptomatic patients.

7.2.5. Early repolarization syndromes
Early repolarization syndrome (ERS) is diagnosed in a patient
resuscitated from PVT or VF without any heart disease and
the early repolarization pattern (ERP); J-point elevation
≥1 mm in ≥2 adjacent inferior and/or lateral ECG leads
(Figure 32). [135][,][231][,][1017][–][1019] However, ERP is most often a benign
finding and the prevalence of ERP has been reported as 5.8% in
adults and is more common in young males and athletes. [135][,][231][,][1017][–][1021] Nonetheless, ERP is over-represented in
relatives of SADS cases [282][,][1022] and of CA survivors. [182][,][916] The
diagnostic yield and utility of genetic testing is low. [1023][–][1025]

High-risk ECG features have been proposed to increase likelihood of ERS: prominent J-waves ≥2 mm, dynamic changes in
J-point elevation (.0.1 mV) and J-waves associated with a horizontal or descending ST-segment (Figure 34). [231][,][1026][,][1027] ERP
with a horizontal ST-segment was associated with arrhythmic
risk in an elderly and IVF population. [1027] Nonetheless, ERS survivors and relatives of SADS cases also exhibit a higher prevalence of the ascending/upsloping ST segment than
controls. [282][,][1018] At least 40% of ERS patients with VF have subsequent episodes, with 27% suffering multiple episodes. [231][,][1028][,][1029] Isoproterenol infusion is effective in acute
suppression of recurrent ICD discharges and electrical
storm. [1030][–][1032] AADs that block the transient outward potassium current can prevent VF. [922][,][1030][,][1033] A retrospective multicentre study showed a reduction of recurrent VF after initiation
of quinidine. [1030] Phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitors such as cilostazol and milrinone also reduced the recurrence of VF. [1032]

Ablation of a PVC trigger, usually from the Purkinje system,
has an acute success rate of 87–100% and may be effective in
preventing recurrence in patients with drug-refractory
VF. [1010][,][1017] Detailed electroanatomic mapping may reveal localized structural alterations in 39% of ERS patients. [1010] Ablation
of these areas successfully suppressed electrical storm and
may be a therapeutic option in experienced centres. Whether
catheter ablation improves long-term outcomes is currently

unknown.

Data for risk stratification of patients with suspected ERS without prior CA are unavailable. In individuals with ERP and unexplained syncope, this panel has recommended that follow-up
with an ILR should be considered. As the prognosis of asymptomatic subjects with ERP is good, ICD therapy is usually not indicated. [1034][–][1036] If, however, there is a high-risk ERP and a strong
family history of unexplained juvenile SD, then ICD implantation
or quinidine may be considered.

7.2.6. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia
CPVT is a heritable disorder characterized by catecholamine
induced bidirectional VT and PVT in the absence of SHD or ischaemia.
The disease has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 10000 (Figure 35). [135]

There are two main genetic types: a dominant disorder due to mutations in the gene encoding for the cardiac ryanodine receptor
(RYR2) and a recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cardiac
calsequestrin gene (CASQ2). [135][,][178] Mutations in TRDN and
CALM1-3 have been identified in patients with atypical forms of catecholaminergic VAs. [1042] At the present time, however, it is unclear
whether they are distinct arrhythmic entities. [1043] Patients with

–
KCNJ2 mutations causing Andersen Tawil syndrome type 1 may
sometimes exhibit bidirectional and PVT, but are distinguished by
their syndromic associations. [1044]

tachycardia; ICD, implantable cardioverter defibrillator; LCSD, left cardiac sympathetic denervation; PVC, premature ventricular complex; VA, ventricular
arrhythmia; VT, ventricular tachycardia. [a] General recommendations: avoidance of competitive sports, avoidance of strenuous exercise, avoidance of
stressful environments. [b] Preferred beta-blockers: nadolol, propranolol.


The clinical manifestations of CPVT usually occur in the first
decade of life prompted by physical activity or emotional
stress. [1045] Most CPVT patients have normal ECG and echocardiogram. Nonetheless, some patients present mild ECG abnormalities, such as sinus bradycardia and prominent U waves. Exercise
stress test is the most important diagnostic test, because it elicits
the distinguishing bidirectional or PVT that establish the diagnosis
(Figure 36). [135] A diagnosis can also be made in the presence of a
mutation in genes associated with CPVT. Epinephrine or isoproterenol challenge may be considered when exercise stress testing is not feasible. [1046]

Diagnosis in childhood, the lack of beta-blocker therapy, and complex arrhythmias during the exercise stress test on a full dose of betablockers are independent predictors for arrhythmic events. [1047]

Exercise restriction and beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are the first-line therapy for CPVT patients. [135]

Non-selective beta-blockers such as nadolol and propranolol are
preferred. [1048][,][1049] This panel has confirmed the indication to treat
genetically positive family members with beta-blockers, even in the
absence of documented exercise- or stress-induced VAs. [1047][,][1050]

Data suggest that flecainide significantly reduces the VA burden in
CPVT patients and should be considered in addition to beta-blockers
when control of arrhythmias is incomplete. [1051][–][1053] In selected


patients who show intolerance to beta-blocker therapy, pharmacological therapy with flecainide alone is an option. [1054]

Maximal protection with beta-blockers, flecainide and ICD is indi
cated in survivors of a CA. An ICD should also be considered in

CPVT patients with breakthrough VA on beta-blockers and flecainide. [135] The ICD should, however, be programmed with long delays
and high rates before defibrillation, because initiating bidirectional VT
responds less effectively to defibrillation than subsequent PVT/VF,
and painful shocks can trigger further and incessant arrhythmias. [1055]

LCSD has been proposed as an additional therapy in patients in
whom pharmacological treatment is not effective or feasible.
Although LCSD reduces the recurrence of major cardiac events in
previously symptomatic patients, one-third of patients still suffer recurrences of arrhythmia. [1056] Therefore, LCSD has not been considered to be a replacement for ICD therapy but a complementary
therapy in symptomatic patients.
A recent systematic review of 53 studies including CPVT patients
with an ICD concluded that secondary prevention patients managed
with OMT, LCSD and exercise restriction could reduce ICD use. [1057]

This observation was supported by a subsequent multicentric investigation showing that all the three SCD observed occurred in patients
with an ICD. [1058] At present it seems premature, on the base of this evidence, to demote ICD implant in survivors of CA with CPVT. [1057]

threshold for diagnosis: A QTc ≤320 ms alone, or B a
QTc ≤360 ms combined with a family history of SQTS,
aborted CA in the absence of heart disease or pathogenic mutation [1064][–][1067] (Figure 37). The disease has high lethality in all age
groups, including the first months of life. [1063][,][1068][,][1069] The probability of a first CA by the age of 40 years is .40%. [1068] While an
ICD is used for secondary prevention, [1069] primary prevention
remains contentious and is based upon prior symptoms and
QTc interval. [1063][,][1068][,][1069] Quinidine is currently the best supported AAD, but should be monitored for excessive QT prolongation, while isoprenaline may be considered in electrical
storm. [1070][,][1071] Drugs that shorten QT interval should be
avoided, e.g. nicorandil. [1072] Loop recorder implantation should
be considered in children and young asymptomatic SQTS

patients.

4088 ESC Guidelines

### 8. Special aspects in selected populations

8.1. Pregnant patients and peri-partum
cardiomyopathy
Pregnancy and the post-partum period contribute a significant risk in
women with arrhythmic heart disease and is covered in the 2018
ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during
pregnancy. [1076][–][1080] New-onset VT may present during pregnancy and
risk of recurrent VT is higher in patients with previous VT and SHD. [1081]

Peri-partum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) should be ruled out in the case
of new-onset VT during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy or in the early
post-partum period. [1082] A genetic contribution may be present in up
to 20% of patients with PPCM (in particular titin-truncating variants) [1083] and future studies should reveal if genetic testing plays a
role in PPCM patients with a positive family history.

8.1.1. Electrocardioversion and implantable
cardioverter defibrillator therapy in pregnancy
Cardioversion seems safe in all phases of pregnancy and case reports
show neither compromise in fetal blood flow nor initiation of preterm labour. [1084] Foetal heart rate should be routinely controlled
after cardioversion. [1085] If an ICD is indicated, ICD implantation
should be performed beyond 8 weeks of gestation with radiation
protection by experienced operator teams. [1086] Echocardiographic
guidance or a 3D mapping system may be helpful in ICD implantation
to avoid radiation. [1087][,][1088] In pregnant patients with existing ICD,
routine ICD interrogation is recommended prior to delivery. In patients with PPCM, thresholds for early ICD implantations are higher
than in other conditions because of a high rate of spontaneous recovery after delivery. [1089] WCD have been suggested to temporarily
prevent SCD during the first 3–6 months after diagnosis of PPCM
with LVEF ≤35%, while awaiting recovery. [1090][,][1091]

8.1.2. Pharmacological treatment
Pharmacological treatment of arrhythmias and heart failure in pregnant
women should follow treatment in non-pregnant patients with avoidance of drugs contraindicated in pregnancy, such as ACE inhibitors,
ARB inhibitors/ARNI and renin inhibitors. [1080][,][1082][,][1092][,][1093] The first trimester is associated with the greatest teratogenic risk. Start of pharmacological therapy is advised to begin at the latest possible point in the
pregnancy and with the lowest effective dose. Drug exposure in the second and third trimestera may confer adverse effects on foetal growth
and development as well as increasing the risk of pro-arrhythmia.
It is recommended to check drugs and safety data before initiation of
a new drug during pregnancy, according to the 2018 ESC Guidelines for
the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy. [1080] From

this list, AADs can be summarized as followed:

- Well tolerated: sotalol, oral verapamil

- Use only if potential benefit outweighs potential risk: bisoprolol, carvedilol, digoxin, diltiazem (possible teratogenic effects), disopyramide (uterine contractions), flecainide, lidocaine,
metoprolol, nadolol, propranolol, verapamil IV, quinidine

- Inadequate data: Ivabradine, mexiletine, proprafenone,

vernakalant

- Contraindicated: amiodarone, atenolol, dronedarone.


In LQTS (LQT2 in particular), risk of cardiac events increases substantially in the post-partum period (up to one year after delivery). [1094] Therefore, it is important to continue beta-blocker
therapy throughout pregnancy and post-partum. [955][,][1094][,][1095]

Continuation of beta-blocker treatment is recommended in LQTS
and CPVT [1096] and should be considered in ARVC. [1097][–][1099] No additional risk by pregnancy is known in women with BrS [1100][,][1101]

( [ESC CardioMed chapter 53.6).](https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780198784906.003.0692) [1102]

In patients with PPCM, use of bromocriptine as disease-specific
therapy in addition to standard heart failure therapy has shown
promising results in two clinical trials. [1103][,][1104]

8.1.3. Catheter ablation

In planned pregnancies, symptomatic tachyarrhythmia should be
treated by catheter ablation before pregnancy. If catheter ablation
is indicated in a pregnant patient, one should avoid the procedure
in the first trimester, and electroanatomical mapping-guided procedures should be preferred. [1105][,][1106]

8.2. Heart transplantation
Patients listed for HTX are exposed to an SCD risk and have a high
incidence of VA. Data from large registries suggest a survival benefit
from ICDs. [1108][–][1111] The only randomized study including patients
listed for HTX was prematurely stopped because of low enrolment. [1112] There are no data regarding the role of WCD in patients
listed for HTX. The median expected time on the waiting list, 8–16
months, needs to be considered. [1108][,][1110] However, this panel shares
the opinion that a WCD may be an alternative for an ICD in selected
patients waiting for HTX. [371][,][1113]

In post-HTX patients, SCD is responsible for around 10% of
deaths. [1114][,][1115] Transplant rejection and allograft vasculopathy are
associated with SCD [1114][,][1116][,][1117] ; therefore, ICD implantation may
be appropriate in selected high-risk patients. [1118]

the prevention of sudden cardiac death before and
after heart transplantation

Recommendations Class [a] Level [b]


it is unfeasible as a routine test in mass screening. More cardiovascular diseases are identified by serial (annual) evaluations of
adolescent athletes. [1129][,][1131] The prevalence of false-positive results strongly depends on the criteria used to define an ECG
as ‘abnormal’. [1132][,][1133] Additional tests, such as echocardiography, 24-hour Holter monitoring, stress testing, and CMR, are
requested for athletes who had positive findings at the initial
evaluation. Athletes diagnosed with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease are managed according to available ESC
Guidelines. [4][,][1134][–][1136]

In middle-aged/senior athletes, the most common cause of
SCD is CAD. [1125][,][1137] Before engaging in a vigorous physical
activity, asymptomatic middle-aged/senior athletes should be
evaluated using risk score systems such as the ESC
SCORE2. [4][,][65]

Excellent rates of survival with favourable neurological outcome
after CA has been reported in sports centres equipped with
AED. [1137][,][1138] This justifies the efforts for implementing emergency
programs for SCD prevention, with distribution of AED in sports
arenas and training of coaches and staff to perform CPR and
defibrillation. [1139]

8.3. Sudden cardiac death in athletes
The incidence of SCD in athletes increases with age. [4][,][1120] In apparently healthy athletes (.35 years), the estimated incidence of SCD
ranges from 2 to 6.3 per 100 000 participant-years. In comparison,
in young competitive athletes (≤35 years) the incidence of fatal

–
events is significantly lower, 0.4 3 per 100 000 participantyears. [46][,][47][,][1120] Women athletes are at low risk of SCD; on average,
1 in 14 SCD in athletes occurs in women. [1121]

Pre-participation cardiovascular evaluation offers the potential
to identify athletes at-risk for cardiovascular disease before onset of symptoms. [1122][–][1126] The evaluation protocol needs to be
adapted to the age of the athlete to account for age-specific cardiovascular disease. [1125] Pre-participation evaluation, including
medical history, physical examination, and ECG, appears effective in identifying cardiovascular disease in young athletes (≤35
years of age) by identification of relevant symptoms (e.g. exertional syncope) or ECG abnormalities consistent with inheritable
cardiomyopathies or channelopathies. [1127][–][1130] Although echocardiography can increase the sensitivity of screening for SHD,

4090 ESC Guidelines


8.4. Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome
In patients with Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, the
most common arrhythmia is AV re-entry tachycardia (AVRT;

–
80%), followed by AF (20 30%). SCD secondary to pre-excited AF
resulting in VF is the most feared manifestation of WPW syndrome.
The risk of CA/VF in untreated WPW patients has been estimated at
0.9–2.4 per 1000 person-year. [1143][,][1144] The management of WPW
patients has recently been reviewed in the 2019 ESC Guidelines
for the management of patients with SVT [302] and updated with a particular focus on athletes in 2020. [1145] In patients with ventricular
pre-excitation and symptomatic AVRT, catheter ablation is recommended (class I). In asymptomatic patients with ventricular
pre-excitation, both invasive (class IIa) and non-invasive (class IIb)
assessment are options for risk stratification for SCD. While catheter ablation is recommended for asymptomatic accessory pathways
with high-risk features (class I), clinical follow-up (class IIa), or catheter ablations (class IIb) are options based on informed patient

choice. This decision should take into account the location of the ac
cessory pathway, the local ablation experience and the fact that
symptomatic arrhythmias will frequently develop during followup. [1146] For the paediatric population, SVT due to WPW can usually
be managed pharmacologically, and accessory pathways often lose
antegrade conduction in the first years of life. [1147] In children with
asymptomatic accessory pathways, risk stratification is not recommend before the age of 8 years. [1148]

8.5. Prevention of sudden cardiac death

in the elderly
Age is a strong risk factor for death. In several studies, advanced
age was one of the factors associated with a reduced expected
benefit from ICD treatment. In patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy enrolled in MADIT-II trial, a risk scheme composed of 5
clinical factors including age .70 years was predictive of the absence of long-term benefit conferred by the ICD. [1149] In a recent
analysis of ICD patients enrolled in four MADIT studies, age,75
years was a predictor of VT/VF whereas age ≥75 years was a predictor of non-arrhythmic mortality. [365] Consistently, in the recent
randomized DANISH trial in patients with non-ischaemic heart

failure, the association between the ICD and survival decreased

linearly with increasing age, while an age cut-off at ≤70 years
yielded the highest survival. [647] Contemporary non-randomized
data corroborate these findings. In the EU-CERT-ICD prospective cohort study in patients with CAD or cardiomyopathies
with indication for primary prevention ICD implantation, no
ICD benefit was observed in patients aged ≥75 years. [357] In contrast, there was a significant survival benefit in patients aged
,75 years. Further retrospective data are in line with this
observation. [1150]

Biological age may vary in part according to comorbidities.
Indeed, comorbidities significantly influence survival of ICD recipients and a high comorbidity index is associated with less survival
gain in primary or secondary prevention ICD patients. [1149][,][1151]

Therefore, a simple age cut-off cannot guide the decision on ICD
implantation adequately and the ICD indication in elderly patients
should be based on a personalized assessment considering the

overall condition and comorbidities.

|Recommendations|Classa|Levelb|
|---|---|---|
|In elderly patients in whom a benefit from the<br>defibrillator is not expected due to the patient’s<br>age and comorbidities, omission of ICD<br>implantation for primary prevention may be<br>considered.647,1150,1152|IIb|B|



Increased availability of public access defibrillators and community
training in basic life support are key elements to improve survival of
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims.

- Risk calculators for SCD and VA implemented in clinical practice
need to meet agreed high standards for the development, external
validation, and reporting of prediction models.

- Patients with genetic cardiomyopathies and arrhythmia syndromes
require genetic testing as a routine part of their care.

- Genetic testing and counselling require access to an expert multidisciplinary team.

- A systematic workup of cardiac arrest survivors requires a multimodal approach.

- A comprehensive autopsy is recommended in all cases of sudden
death under 50 years and is desirable in all sudden death victims.

- Clinical and genetic evaluation of SADS decedents and their families leads to a diagnosis of genetic heart disease in a substantial
proportion of families.

- An electrical storm refractory to drug treatment requires the availability of advanced catheter ablation techniques, mechanical circulatory support, and autonomic modulation.

When considering ICD therapy benefit, competing risk factors for
non-arrhythmic death and the patient’s wishes and quality of life

need to be taken into account.

9.2. Structural heart disease

- Catheter ablation is recommended in CAD patients with recurrent
symptomatic SMVT despite chronic amiodarone therapy.

- Catheter ablation is the first-line treatment for PVC-induced
cardiomyopathy.

- In HNDCM/DCM patients, indication for primary prevention
ICD implantation should not be restricted to an LVEF ≤35%.
Additional risk factors (e.g. CMR and genetics) are important to

consider.

- Patients with an LMNA mutation require specific risk stratification

for SCD.

- ARVC patients have a high rate of appropriate ICD interventions
which may not necessarily be classified as lifesaving.

### 9. Key messages

9.1. General aspects


ESC Guidelines 4091



- A validated risk calculator (HCM Risk-Kids score) is useful to assess
the risk for SCD in HCM patients younger than 16 years.

- Myotonic dystrophy patients with palpitations suspected of arrhythmia, syncope or aborted sudden death need to be evaluated
by invasive electrophysiological study.

- In patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and monomorphic VT,
catheter ablation is the preferred treatment.

9.3. Primary electrical disease

- Nadolol or propranolol are the preferred beta-blockers in LQTS
and CPVT patients.

- In asymptomatic LQTS patients the arrhythmic risk (1-2-3 Risk calculator) may be useful to calculate.

- A type 1 Brugada ECG pattern provoked by sodium channel
blocker test in the absence of other findings does not diagnose

the BrS.

- SCD risk stratification in asymptomatic BrS patients with a spontaneous type 1 pattern remains controversial.

- Routine catheter ablation is not recommended in asymptomatic
BrS patients.

- The diagnosis of idiopathic VF requires exclusion of an
underlying structural, channelopathic, or metabolic
aetiology.

ERP can be a benign finding and is distinct from ERS.

- Left cardiac denervation plays an important role in the management of CPVT and LQTS patients.
### 10. Gaps in evidence

10.1. General aspects

- Accurate screening tests to detect heart conditions associated
with SCD in asymptomatic individuals in the general population
are required.

- In patients with SHD, the optimal time interval between repeated
non-invasive and invasive prognostic tests, in case of a negative

test, is unknown.

- Improved assessment of genetic variants of uncertain significance
and likely pathogenic variants is needed.

- The utility of polygenic risk scores in patients at risk of SCD re
quires investigation.

10.2. Structural heart disease—general

The long-term safety and efficacy of S-ICDs is unknown.

- The role of primary preventive ICD therapy in patients with SHD
and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction has not been
studied systematically.

- The optimal techniques to undertake VT substrate mapping and

ablation in SHD remain to be determined.

- The role of ICD implantation in end-stage heart failure patients
supported by current-generation, continuous-flow LVADs is

unclear.


10.3. Idiopathic premature ventricular
complexes/ventricular tachycardia

- The beneficial role of catheter ablation or anti-arrhythmic drug
treatment in patients with asymptomatic, frequent PVCs and pre
served cardiac function needs to be determined.

10.4. Coronary artery disease

- It is unknown which patients with chronic CAD and severely impaired LVEF are at low risk for SCD.

- The role of LGE-CMR for risk stratification for SCD in chronic

CAD is unclear.

- RCTs are needed to determine the role of ICDs after successful

VT ablation in chronic CAD with mildly reduced or preserved

LVEF.

10.5. Cardiomyopathies

- It is unknown if PVC-induced cardiomyopathy is a diagnosis on its
own or if an underlying predisposition is needed.

The predictive value of LGE-CMR findings (e.g. pattern and
amount of LGE) for individual risk stratification for SCD in patients

with cardiac sarcoidosis, HCM, and DCM/HNDC is unclear.

- Studies are needed to determine the role of PES in patients with
cardiac sarcoidosis and DCM/HNDC who have a mildly reduced
or preserved cardiac function and LGE on CMR.

- Prospective data on the association between intensity and duration of exercise and manifestation and severity of the phenotype
in healthy ARVC mutation carriers are lacking.

- The beneficial role of ICDs after successful ablation in ARVC patients who present with haemodynamically tolerated VT needs

to be studied.

- Data on clinical outcome, predictors for arrhythmic events, and indication for treatment, including ICD therapy, in patients with biventricular and left-dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy are
required.

10.6. Valvular heart disease

- There is a lack of knowledge to identify patients with MVP at risk

for VA and SCD.

10.7. Congenital heart disease

- There is a lack of knowledge regarding the absolute risk for VA and
SCD in CHD that have undergone repair with contemporary surgical approaches.

10.8. Primary electrical disease

- Robust evidence is required to support the prophylactic use of the
ICD on top of medical therapy with beta-blockers and genespecific therapy in LQTS patients.

- More data are required to determine the role of LCSD and ICD in
high-risk LQTS patients who do not tolerate medical therapy.

4092 ESC Guidelines



Improved diagnostic and risk stratification tools for asymptomatic
Brugada patients and suspected early repolarization syndrome are

needed.

- The role of endo-epicardial mapping to identify localized structural
alterations potentially related to IVF and targeted catheter ablation

needs to be further studied.



Long-term data are required on the efficacy of the ICD vs. no ICD

in CPVT survivors of cardiac arrest.

- It is poorly understood why women are at low risk of
sport-related SCD.

### 12. Quality indicators

Quality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care quality, including structural aspects, process, and outcomes of care. [1153] They
serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to guideline recommendations, through associated quality improvement initiatives and the
benchmarking of care providers. [1154][,][1155] As such, the role of QIs in improving care and outcomes is increasingly recognized by healthcare authorities, professional organizations, payers, and the public. [1153]

The ESC understands the need for measuring and reporting quality and outcomes of cardiovascular care, and has established methods for the development of the ESC QIs for the quantification of
care and outcomes for cardiovascular disease. [1153] In parallel with
the writing of this Clinical Practice Guideline document, a process
has been initiated to develop QIs for patients with, or at risk of,
VA or SCD using the ESC methodology and through the collaboration with domain experts and the European Heart Rhythm


Association. These QIs, alongside their specifications and development process, will be published separately.
