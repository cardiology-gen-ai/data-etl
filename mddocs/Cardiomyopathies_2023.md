### **1. Preamble**

Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or thera-­
peutic approach for an individual patient with a given condition.
Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals and the
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) makes its Guidelines freely

available.

ESC Guidelines do not override the individual responsibility of health
professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consider-­
ation of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that pa-­
tient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is
also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and reg-­
ulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of
prescription, and, where appropriate, to respect the ethical rules of
their profession.

ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given
topic and are regularly updated. ESC Policies and Procedures for for-­
mulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website
[(https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines).](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)

The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to re-­
present professionals involved with the medical care of patients with
this pathology. The selection procedure aimed to include members
from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC
Subspecialty Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and in-­
clusion, notably with respect to gender and country of origin. The Task
Force performed a critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic ap-­
proaches, including assessment of the risk-benefit ratio. The strength of
every recommendation and the level of evidence supporting them were
weighed and scored according to predefined scales as outlined below.
The Task Force followed ESC voting procedures, and all approved re-­
commendations were subject to a vote and achieved at least 75%
agreement among voting members.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration
of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or
potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest
were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and
[can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[Guidelines) and have been compiled in a report published in a supple-­](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
mentary document with the guidelines. The Task Force received its

entire financial support from the ESC without any involvement from
the healthcare industry.

The ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee supervises
and co-ordinates the preparation of new guidelines and is responsible
for the approval process. ESC Guidelines undergo extensive review
by the CPG Committee and external experts, including members
from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC
Subspecialty Communities and National Cardiac Societies. After appro-­
priate revisions, the guidelines are signed off by all the experts involved
in the Task Force. The finalized document is signed off by the CPG
Committee for publication in the *European Heart Journal* . The guidelines
were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical
knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their writing. Tables
of evidence summarizing the findings of studies informing development
of the guidelines are included. The ESC warns readers that the technical
language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this

respect.

Off-label use of medication may be presented in this guideline if a suf-­
ficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically ap-­
propriate for a given condition.

However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be
made by the responsible health professional giving special consideration

to:

- The specific situation of the patient. Unless otherwise provided for
by national regulations, off-label use of medication should be limited
to situations where it is in the patient’s interest, with regard to the
quality, safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has
been informed and has provided consent.

- Country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental
drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which health profes-­
sionals are subject, where applicable.
### **2. Introduction**

The objective of this European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guideline is
to help healthcare professionals diagnose and manage patients with car-­
diomyopathies according to the best available evidence. Uniquely for
relatively common cardiovascular diseases, there are very few rando-­
mized controlled clinical trials in patients with cardiomyopathies. For
this reason, the majority of the recommendations in this guideline are
based on observational cohort studies and expert consensus opinion.
The aim is to provide healthcare professionals with a practical diagnos-­
tic and treatment framework for patients of all ages and, as an increasing
number of patients have a known genetic basis for their disease, the
guideline also considers the implications of a diagnosis for families
and provides advice on reproduction and contraception. As cardio-­
myopathies can present at any age and can affect individuals and families
across the entire life course, this guideline follows the principle of con-­
sidering cardiomyopathies in all age groups as single disease entities,
with recommendations applicable to children and adults with cardio-­
myopathy throughout, while accepting that the evidence base for
many of the recommendations is significantly more limited for children.
Age-related differences are specifically highlighted.

This is a new guideline, not an update of existing guidelines, with the
exception of the section on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), in
which we have provided a focused update to the *2014 ESC Guidelines*
*on diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy* . [1] As such,
most of the recommendations in this guideline are new. It is beyond
the scope of this guideline to provide detailed descriptions and


recommendations for each individual cardiomyopathy phenotype; in-­
stead, the aim is to provide a guide to the diagnostic approach to car-­
diomyopathies, highlight general evaluation and management issues,
and signpost the reader to the relevant evidence base for the

recommendations.

Adoption of morphological and functional disease definitions means
that the number of possible aetiologies is considerable, particularly in
young children. As it is impractical to provide an exhaustive compen-­
dium of all possible causes of cardiomyopathy, the guideline focuses
on the most common disease phenotypes, but additional references
for less common disorders are also provided. Similarly, treatment re-­
commendations focus largely on generic management issues but refer
to specific rare diseases when appropriate. The central illustration
( *Figure 1* ) highlights key aspects in the evaluation and management of
cardiomyopathies addressed in this guideline.

This is the first major international guideline to address cardiomyop-­
athies other than HCM. Other major innovations include:

- A new phenotypic description of cardiomyopathies, including up-­

dated descriptions of dilated and non-dilated left ventricular (LV) car-­
diomyopathy phenotypes, and highlighting the key role of ventricular
myocardial scar assessment using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
imaging.

- A focus on the patient pathway, from presentation, through initial as-­

sessment and diagnosis, to management, highlighting the importance
of considering cardiomyopathy as a cause of common clinical presen-­
tations (e.g. heart failure, arrhythmia) and the importance of utilizing a
multiparametric approach following the identification of the present-­
ing phenotype to arrive at an aetiological diagnosis.

- Updated recommendations for clinical and genetic cascade screening
for relatives of individuals with cardiomyopathies.

- A focus on cardiomyopathies across the life course, from paediatric
to adult age (including transition), and considering the different clin-­
ical phases (e.g. concealed, overt, end stage).

- New recommendations on sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk stratifi-­

cation for different cardiomyopathy phenotypes, including in child-­
hood, and highlighting the important role of genotype in the

assessment of sudden death risk.

- Updated recommendations for the management of left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) in HCM.

- A multidisciplinary approach to cardiomyopathies that has the pa-­

tient and their family at its heart.
### **3. Phenotypic approach to ** **cardiomyopathies**

In medicine, classification systems are used to standardize disease no-­
menclature by grouping disorders according to shared characteristics.
In 2008, the ESC promoted a pragmatic system for the clinical descrip-­
tion of cardiomyopathies in which a historical focus on ventricular
morphology and function was maintained, while signposting aetiological
diversity through subdivision into genetic and non-genetic subtypes. [2]

Since then, knowledge of cardiomyopathies has increased substantially
through the application of new imaging and molecular technologies.

In this guideline, the Task Force took a number of considerations into
account when deciding its approach to disease description. These in-­
cluded: (i) a historical legacy which, while still useful, has led to contra-­
dictory and confusing terminology in many situations; (ii) the evolving
nature of cardiomyopathies over a lifetime; (iii) aetiological complexity
with multiple disease processes contributing to disease phenotypes;

(iv) differential disease expression in families; and (v) emerging
aetiology-focused therapies.

The Task Force concluded that a single classification system that em-­
braces all possible causes of disease and every clinical scenario remains
an aspiration that is outside the scope of this clinical guideline. Instead,
the Task Force updated the existing clinical classification to include new


phenotypic descriptions and to simplify terminology, while simultan-­
eously providing a conceptual framework for diagnosis and treatment.
This nomenclature prompts clinicians to consider cardiomyopathy as
the cause of several clinical presentations (e.g. arrhythmia, heart failure),
and focuses on morphological and functional characteristics of the
myocardium ( *Figure 2* ). It is important to recognize that different

**3514** ESC Guidelines


cardiomyopathy phenotypes may coexist in the same family, and that
disease progression in an individual patient can include evolution
from one cardiomyopathy phenotype to another. Nevertheless, the
Task Force recommends an approach to disease nomenclature and
diagnosis that is based on the predominant cardiac phenotype at
presentation.

While recognizing the fact that genes encoding cardiac ion channels
may be implicated in some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM), conduction disorders, and arrhythmias, the Task Force was
not persuaded that there is sufficient evidence to consider cardiac chan-­
nelopathies as cardiomyopathies, in keeping with the approach taken by
other recent ESC Guidelines. [3]

The most important changes in this guideline relate to the group of
conditions variously included under the umbrella term ‘arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathies’. This term refers to a group of conditions that fea-­
ture structural and functional abnormalities of the myocardium (identi-­
fied by cardiac imaging and/or macroscopic and microscopic
pathological investigation) and ventricular arrhythmia. This nosology
has evolved in response to the recognition of the clinical and genetic
overlap between right ventricular (RV) and LV cardiomyopathies, but
a lack of a generally accepted definition has meant that the term encom-­
passes a broad range of diverse pathologies and has introduced a num-­
ber of inconsistencies and contradictions when applied in a clinical
setting. [4] The term ‘arrhythmogenic right ventricular (dysplasia/) cardio-­
myopathy’ (ARVC) was originally used by physicians who first discov-­
ered the disease, in the pre-genetic and pre-CMR era, to describe a
new heart muscle disease predominantly affecting the right ventricle,
whose cardinal clinical manifestation was the occurrence of malignant
ventricular arrhythmias. Subsequently, autopsy investigations, geno-­
type–phenotype correlation studies and the increasing use of
contrast-enhancement CMR led to the identification of fibro-fatty re-­
placement of the myocardium as a key phenotypic feature of the dis-­
ease that affects the myocardium of both ventricles, with LV
involvement which may even exceed the severity of RV involvement.
This has led to the catch-all term of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
(ACM), which represents the evolution of the original term of
ARVC. [5] Consistent with its general approach, the Task Force agreed
to highlight the vital importance of arrhythmia as a diagnostic red flag
and prognostic marker across a range of clinical phenotypes, but did
not recommend the use of the term ACM as a *distinct* cardiomyopathy
subtype as it lacks a morphological or functional definition consistent
with the existing classification scheme. While acknowledging that
‘ACM’ as an umbrella term that encompasses diverse clinical pheno-­
types has been previously used, this decision will, it is hoped, help to re-­
solve many of the circular arguments that currently bedevil the field.
The fundamental tenet throughout this guideline is that aetiology is vital
to the management of patients with heart muscle disease and that a
careful and consistent description of the morphological and functional
phenotype is a crucial first step in the diagnostic pathway, while the final
diagnosis will ideally describe aetiology alongside the phenotype. [6][,][7]

**3.1. Definitions**
A cardiomyopathy is defined as ‘a myocardial disorder in which the
heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence
of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, valvular disease, and
congenital heart disease (CHD) sufficient to cause the observed myo-­
cardial abnormality’. [2] This definition applies to both children and
adults and makes no a priori assumptions about aetiology (which
can be familial/genetic or acquired) or myocardial pathology. While



![Page 53 Images](Cardiomyopathies_2023_images/page_053_images.png)

the focus of this guideline is on genetic cardiomyopathies, the system-­
atic approach to diagnosis starting from the phenotype at presenta-­
tion described in this guideline enables clinicians to reach precise
diagnoses that may also include non-genetic (e.g. inflammatory, toxic,
and multisystem diseases) causes. It is important to note that cardio-­
myopathies can coexist with ischaemic, valvular, and hypertensive dis-­
ease and that the presence of one does not exclude the possibility of

the other.

The morphological and functional traits used to describe the cardio-­
myopathy phenotypes are shown in *Table 3* . The major innovation is
the specific inclusion of myocardial tissue characterization traits, includ-­
ing non-ischaemic ventricular scarring or fatty replacement, which can
occur with and without ventricular dilatation, wall motion abnormal-­
ities, or global systolic or diastolic dysfunction. This phenotype is im-­
portant to recognize, as it may be the sole clue to the diagnosis of a
cardiomyopathy and has prognostic significance that varies with the
underlying aetiology.

Atrial dilatation (left and/or right) is an important additional clinical
finding in the phenotypic description of cardiomyopathies. Ultra-rare,
usually autosomal recessive, cases of pure dilated atrial cardiomyopathy
are reported, [8] but these are outside the scope of this guideline.

**3.2. Cardiomyopathy phenotypes**
**3.2.1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined as the presence of in-­
creased LV wall thickness (with or without RV hypertrophy) or mass
that is not solely explained by abnormal loading conditions. [2]

**3.2.2. Dilated cardiomyopathy**
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is defined as the presence of LV dilata-­
tion and global or regional systolic dysfunction unexplained solely by ab-­
normal loading conditions (e.g. hypertension, valve disease, CHD) or
CAD. [2] Very rarely, LV dilatation can occur with normal ejection frac-­
tion (EF) in the absence of athletic remodelling or other environmental
factors; this is not in itself a cardiomyopathy, but may represent an early
manifestation of DCM. The preferred term for this is *isolated left ven-­*
*tricular dilatation.*

Right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction may be present but are
not necessary for the diagnosis. When dilatation or wall motion abnor-­
malities are confined or predominant to the right ventricle, the possibil-­
ity of ARVC should be considered (see *Section 3.2.4* ).

**3.2.3. Non-dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy**
Hitherto, the definition of DCM had a number of important limita-­
tions, most notably the exclusion of genetic and acquired disorders

that manifest as intermediate phenotypes that do not meet standard
disease definitions in spite of the presence of myocardial disease on
cardiac imaging or tissue analysis. In a previous ESC statement, this
phenomenon inspired the creation of a new disease category, hypo-­
kinetic non-dilated cardiomyopathy. [9] In this guideline, we propose
replacement of this term with non-dilated left ventricular cardiomy-­
opathy (NDLVC), which can be further characterized by the pres-­
ence or absence of systolic dysfunction (regional or global).
Isolated LV dysfunction (regional or global) without scarring should
also be considered under this diagnostic category. The NDLVC
phenotype is defined as the presence of non-ischaemic LV scarring


or fatty replacement regardless of the presence of global or regional
wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs), or isolated global LV hypokine-­
sia without scarring.

The NDLVC phenotype will include individuals that up until now may
have variably been described as having DCM (but without LV dilata-­
tion), arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy (ALVC), leftdominant ARVC, or arrhythmogenic DCM (but often without fulfilling
diagnostic criteria for ARVC) ( *Figure 3* ). The simple worked example
( *Figure 4* ) shows how the identification of an NDLVC phenotype should
trigger a multiparametric approach that leads to a specific aetiological
diagnosis, with implications for clinical treatment.

showing how a systematic multiparametric approach to clinical phenotyping, starting from the recognition of a clinical phenotype and integrating extended
phenotypic information and targeted diagnostics, including genetic testing, can be used to arrive at highly specific phenotypic descriptions that can result in
personalized treatment plans. In this worked example, the diagnosis transforms from a simplistic categorization to a complex genetic disorder characterized
by myocardial scar and a propensity to ventricular arrhythmia.


**3.2.4. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular**
**cardiomyopathy**

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is
defined as the presence of predominantly RV dilatation and/or dys-­
function in the presence of histological involvement and/or
electrocardiographic abnormalities in accordance with published
criteria. [10]

For decades, ARVC has been one of the principal cardiomyopathy
subtypes. It has been defined in accordance with published consensus
criteria that comprise RV dysfunction (global or regional), histological
abnormalities in the form of fibro-fatty replacement of cardiomyocytes,
electrocardiographic characteristics, ventricular arrhythmia of RV ori-­
gin, and the presence of familial disease and/or pathogenic variants in
desmosomal protein genes.


Over time, the clinical paradigm of ARVC has moved from a focus on
severe RV disease and malignant ventricular arrhythmia to a broader
concept that includes concealed or subclinical phenotypes and biventri-­
cular or even left-dominant disease. This has led to a plethora of new
terms, including ‘arrhythmogenic left ventricular cardiomyopathy
(ALVC)’, ‘left and right dominant cardiomyopathy’, ‘arrhythmogenic di-­
lated cardiomyopathy’, and most recently, the catch-all term ‘arrhyth-­
mogenic cardiomyopathy’. The term ARVC can be used to describe
the original variant in which ventricular dilatation or wall motion abnor-­
malities are predominantly confined to the right ventricle, with or with-­
out LV involvement, and the 2010 modified Task Force criteria for the
diagnosis of ARVC can be applied. [10] Predominant LV disease can also
occur in the same family; [5] see *Section 7.3* for recommendations on as-­
sessment and management of this phenotype.

ESC Guidelines **3517**


**3.2.5. Restrictive cardiomyopathy**
Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is defined as restrictive left and/or
RV pathophysiology in the presence of normal or reduced diastolic vo-­
lumes (of one or both ventricles), normal or reduced systolic volumes,
and normal ventricular wall thickness. [2]

Restrictive cardiomyopathy commonly presents as biatrial enlarge-­
ment. Left ventricular systolic function can be preserved, but it is rare
for contractility to be completely normal. Restrictive pathophysiology
may not be present throughout the natural history, but only at an initial
stage (with an evolution towards a hypokinetic-dilated phase). [11]

Restrictive physiology can also occur in patients with end-stage hyper-­
trophic and dilated cardiomyopathy; the preferred terms are ‘hyper-­
trophic’ or ‘dilated cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology’.
Restrictive ventricular physiology can also be caused by endocardial
pathology (fibrosis, fibroelastosis, and thrombosis) that impairs diastolic
function.

**3.3. Other traits and syndromes associated**
**with cardiomyopathy phenotypes**
**3.3.1. Left ventricular hypertrabeculation (left**
**ventricular non-compaction)**

The term ‘left ventricular non-compaction’ (LVNC) has been used to
describe a ventricular phenotype characterized by prominent LV tra-­
beculae and deep intertrabecular recesses. The myocardial wall is often
thickened with a thin, compacted epicardial layer and a thicker endocar-­
dial layer. In some patients, this abnormal trabecular architecture is as-­
sociated with LV dilatation and systolic dysfunction. Left ventricular
non-compaction is frequently a familial trait and is associated with var-­
iants in a range of genes, including those encoding proteins of the sarco-­
mere, Z-disc, cytoskeleton, and nuclear envelope. [12][–][16]

Left ventricular non-compaction has also been used to describe an
acquired and sometimes transient phenomenon of excessive LV trabe-­
culation (e.g. in athletes, during pregnancy, or following vigorous activ-­
ity) [17][–][19] that must reflect increased prominence of an otherwise
normal myocardial architecture, given that cardiomyocytes are termin-­
ally differentiated and the formation of new cardiac structures is
impossible. [20]

The Task Force does not consider LVNC to be a cardiomyopathy in
the general sense. Instead, it is seen as a phenotypic trait that can occur
either in isolation or in association with other developmental abnormal-­
ities, ventricular hypertrophy, dilatation, and/or systolic dysfunction.
Given the lack of morphometric evidence for ventricular compaction
in humans, [21][,][22] the term ‘hypertrabeculation’, rather than LVNC, is re-­
commended, particularly when the phenomenon is transient or clearly

of adult onset.

**3.3.2. Takotsubo syndrome**

Transient LV apical ballooning syndrome, or takotsubo syndrome, is
characterized, in its most typical variant, by transient regional systolic
dysfunction, dilatation, and oedema involving the LV apex and/or midventricle in the absence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary
angiography. [23] Patients present with an abrupt onset of angina-like
chest pain and have diffuse T wave inversion (TWI), sometimes pre-­
ceded by ST-segment elevation and mild cardiac enzyme elevation.
Most reported cases occur in post-menopausal women. Symptoms
are often preceded by emotional or physical stress. Norepinephrine
concentration is elevated in most patients and a transient, dynamic out-­
flow tract pressure gradient is reported in some cases. Left ventricular


function usually normalizes over a period of days to weeks, and recur-­
rence is rare. The same kind of reversible myocardial dysfunction is oc-­
casionally encountered in patients with intracranial haemorrhage or
other acute cerebral accidents (neurogenic myocardial stunning).

Takotsubo syndrome is sometimes referred to as takotsubo or
stress cardiomyopathy. Given the transient nature of the phenomenon,
the Task Force does not recommend its classification as a
cardiomyopathy.
### **4. Epidemiology**

Cardiomyopathies have a variable expression throughout life. [24]

Geographical distribution of genetic variants influences estimated
prevalence in different populations, ethnicities, regions, and countries.
The complexity of diagnostic criteria for some conditions, such as
ARVC, limits the evaluation of the true prevalence of the disease in
the general population. Moreover, epidemiological data are often not
collected systematically at population level. For example, the preva-­
lence of idiopathic DCM has been recently estimated to be almost
10 times higher based on several population-based estimates and indir-­
ect assumptions of the prevalence of genetic variants associated with
the disease in general populations, [25] and with less stringent diagnostic
criteria. [9]

There are no specific data on the epidemiology of the NDLVC
phenotype, but patients affected by it have previously been included
in DCM or ARVC cohorts, from which extrapolations may be pos-­
sible. Contemporary epidemiological metrics for the main cardiomy-­
opathies are shown in *Table 4* . Further details on the epidemiology of
cardiomyopathies can be found in the [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data)

**3518** ESC Guidelines


**4.1. Special populations**
Several forms of cardiomyopathy previously considered secondary to
external factors were recently proved to have genetic contributors,
leading to the ‘second hit theory’, and a genetic aetiology should be
kept in mind for family history taking and genetic testing.

- Titin gene truncating variants ( *TTN* tv) represent a prevalent genetic
predisposition for alcoholic cardiomyopathy (present in 13.5% of pa-­
tients vs. 2.9% in controls), as they are associated with a worse left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in DCM patients who consume
alcohol above recommended levels. [42]

- Unrecognized rare variants in cardiomyopathy-associated genes, par-­

ticularly *TTN* tv (in 7.5% of cases), appear to be associated with an in-­
creased risk of cancer therapy-induced cardiomyopathy in children
and adults. [43]

- Rare truncating variants in eight genes are found in 15% of women
with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), and two-thirds are
*TTN* tv (10% of patients vs. 1.4% of the reference population). [44][,][45]

Additionally, other truncating variants are identified in the *DSP*
(1%), *FLNC* (1%), and *BAG3* (0.2%) genes. [45]

- Anderson–Fabry disease is found in 0.94% of males and 0.90% of fe-­

males in cardiac screening programmes for left ventricular hyper-­
trophy (LVH) in selected populations and HCM. [46]

- Screening with bone scintigraphy found a high prevalence of trans-­

thyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) in specific populations: 8%
in severe aortic stenosis, 12% in heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF) with LVH, 7% in LVH/HCM depending on the age,
and 7% in carpal tunnel syndrome undergoing surgery (a higher
prevalence if it is bilateral), mainly for the wild-type form. [47][,][48]

- Disease-causing variants in genes implicated in DCM, NDLVC, and
ARVC have been identified in 8–22% of adults and children present-­
ing with acute myocarditis. [49][–][51] Individuals with an acute myocarditis
presentation and desmosomal protein gene variants were shown to
have a higher rate of myocarditis recurrence and ventricular arrhyth-­
mia compared with myocarditis patients without a desmosomal vari-­
ant identified. [52]
### **5. Integrated patient management**

The diagnosis, assessment, and management of patients with cardiomy-­
opathy requires a co-ordinated, systematic, and individualized pathway
that delivers optimized care by a multidisciplinary and expert team.
Central to this approach is not only the individual patient, but also
the family as a whole; clinical findings in relatives are essential for under-­
standing what happens to the patient, and vice versa. [53][,][54]

**5.1. Multidisciplinary cardiomyopathy**

**teams**

Healthcare professionals encounter diseases affecting the myocardium
in many and varied clinical settings. Some may manifest for the first time
with an acute event, including sudden unexplained death, whereas
others present with progressive symptoms or are detected incidentally.
Patients with cardiomyopathy can also have extracardiac manifesta-­
tions (e.g. neurological, neuromuscular, ophthalmological, nephrologic-­
al). Patient care requires the collaboration of different specialties. [55] The
composition of the multidisciplinary team will depend on the patient’s
and family’s needs and the local availability of services ( *Figure 5* ). Patients
with complex needs benefit from a multidisciplinary team, including


relevant specialties as well as the general cardiologist, general practi-­
tioner, and the family/carer. In addition, the integration of genetics
into mainstream cardiology services requires expertise from different
specialties:

- Adult and paediatric cardiologists subspecialized in cardiogenetic

conditions.

- Cardiac imaging specialists (technicians, cardiologists, radiologists), in-­

cluding CMR experts.

- Specialist nurses and/or genetic counsellors with skills in family his-­

tory taking, drawing pedigrees, and patient/family management, par-­
ticularly when the number of disciplines or the complexity implicated
in a patient’s/family’s care increases.

- Clinical psychologists to support patients and their relatives.

- Geneticists and bioinformaticians to interpret results of genetic
investigations.

- Expert pathologists to interpret findings by endomyocardial biopsy
(EMB) and autopsy of individuals dying from a suspected inherited
cardiac condition. Specialist cardiovascular pathology centres play a
crucial role in the autopsy diagnosis of cardiomyopathy when local
expertise is not available. [56][,][57]

Finally, patients’ associations should be promoted and integrated into
the healthcare process for rare and very rare cardiac conditions.

One particularly important aspect of the multidisciplinary approach
to patient care in cardiomyopathies is the need for appropriate transi-­
tion of care from paediatric to adult services. Children with a genetic
cardiomyopathy generally need lifelong cardiac follow-up. The transi-­
tion to adulthood, including the transfer of care to adult cardiomyop-­
athy services, can be challenging for both the child and the parents.
The process of transition should include adequate and timely prepar-­
ation and joint consultations, taking into consideration the child’s
wishes, and level of understanding and independence at different life
stages. Evidence from the field of CHD highlights the importance of
specific interventions that can help the process of transition of clinical
care, including adequate and timely preparation for transition and joint
consultations. [58][,][59]

**5.2. Co-ordination between different**

**levels of care**

A shared care approach between cardiomyopathy specialists and gen-­
eral adult and paediatric cardiology centres is strongly recommended.
While referral cardiomyopathy units are essential for complex cases
with diagnostic and/or treatment difficulties that require expertise
that may only be available in high-volume centres, general adult and
paediatric cardiologists have a key role to play in the diagnosis, manage-­
ment, and follow-up of patients with cardiomyopathy (see *Section 9* ). A
shared approach between cardiomyopathy units and between general
cardiologist/paediatric cardiologist is strongly recommended. This ap-­
proach can be facilitated by the implementation of telemedical contact
between units and the use of remote monitoring with patients. [60] The
creation of local/regional/national/international networks, such as the
European Reference Network for Rare and Low Prevalence
[Complex Diseases of the Heart (ERN GUARD-Heart) (https://](https://guardheart.ern-net.eu)
[guardheart.ern-net.eu) allows clinicians and health professionals to](https://guardheart.ern-net.eu)
share information about these pathologies, for the benefit of cardiomy-­
opathy patients. [61]

### **6. The patient pathway**

The diagnosis of cardiomyopathy rests on the identification of struc-­
tural and/or functional myocardial abnormalities, including myocardial
fibrosis, that are not explained solely by abnormal loading conditions
or CAD. However, disease phenotypes can also include arrhythmic
and electrocardiographic manifestations, morphological abnormalities
of the cardiac valves, and abnormal coronary microcirculatory function.
As a key theme throughout this guideline, the Task Force highlights the
importance of using a systematic approach to the identification and as-­
sessment of patients with a suspected cardiomyopathy. Central to this
is the need for clinicians to consider a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy as
the cause of several common adult and paediatric clinical presentations.
The identification of a cardiomyopathy phenotype is only the beginning
of the diagnostic process and should prompt a systematic search for the
underlying aetiology, which may be genetic or acquired.

**3520** ESC Guidelines


**6.1. Clinical presentation**
Patients with cardiomyopathy may access health services through sev-­
eral pathways. Referral from primary care (e.g. general practitioners
and general paediatricians) may be triggered by symptoms (most
commonly dyspnoea, chest pain, palpitation, syncope) or incidental
findings (e.g. an abnormal electrocardiogram [ECG] in the context of
community, school, work-related medical check-ups, or sports preparticipation screening; the incidental detection of a murmur; or, in-­
creasingly, genotype-first identification as a result of secondary findings
during research or clinical sequencing for other indications). In second-­
ary and tertiary care (general cardiology and paediatric cardiology), pa-­
tients with cardiomyopathy may present to the heart failure clinic with
symptoms of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), mild-­
ly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), or preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF); to the arrhythmia clinic with early-onset conduction disease,
atrial arrhythmia, or ventricular arrhythmia; or to the emergency de-­
partment with suspected myocarditis. Frequently, patients enter the
cardiomyopathy pathway in primary, secondary, or tertiary care as a re-­
sult of family screening following the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy or a
sudden death in a relative, and may also be identified as part of the
work-up for multiorgan disease known to be associated with cardiovas-­
cular involvement. Clinicians in all these settings therefore need to con-­
sider the possibility of cardiomyopathy as a cause and use a systematic,
cardiomyopathy-oriented approach to clinical evaluation.

**6.2. Initial work-up**
The cardiomyopathy-oriented approach is based on interpreting clinic-­
al and instrumental findings to suspect and ultimately generate a
phenotype-based aetiological diagnosis to guide disease-specific man-­
agement. [62] This approach requires deliberate analysis of multipara-­
metric investigations in the individual and their relatives and an
integrated probabilistic analysis of clinical investigations. Re-analysis of
clinical data is required as new information emerges, and family infor-­
mation can provide important clues to the diagnosis, given the variable
expression and incomplete penetrance of most cardiomyopathies, and
can result in differences in diagnostic criteria between probands and re-­
latives. In this context, relatives of individuals with cardiomyopathy can
have non-diagnostic morphological and electrocardiographic abnor-­
malities that can indicate mild and early phenotypic expression of dis-­
ease and can increase diagnostic accuracy for predicting disease in
genotyped populations. The identification of diagnostic clues, or red
flags, is a crucial aspect of the initial work-up.

**6.3. Systematic approach to diagnosis of**
**cardiomyopathy**
A multiparametric approach to the evaluation of patients with sus-­
pected cardiomyopathy is recommended, with the aims of: (i) establish-­
ing and characterizing the presence of a cardiomyopathy phenotype;
and (ii) identifying the underlying aetiological diagnosis. [62] Clinicians
should approach a patient with suspected cardiomyopathy using a ‘car-­
diomyopathy mindset’ ( *Figure 2* ):

- Use multimodality imaging to characterize the phenotype and iden-­

tify abnormal ventricular morphology (e.g. hypertrophy, dilatation)
and function (systolic/diastolic, global/regional), and detect abnormal-­
ities of tissue characterization (e.g. non-ischaemic myocardial scar
and fatty replacement).

- Use a combination of personal and family history, clinical examin-­

ation, electrocardiography, and laboratory investigations to achieve


an aetiological diagnosis, looking for specific signs and symptoms
and laboratory markers suggestive of a specific diagnosis; the pres-­
ence of ventricular and atrial arrhythmia and conduction disease to
aid diagnosis, suggest specific causes, and monitor disease progres-­
sion and risk stratification; and clues from the pedigree to suggest
specific inheritance patterns and identify at-risk relatives. This ap-­
proach should result in a timely and accurate diagnosis to enable early
treatment of symptoms and prevention of disease-related
complications.

**6.4. History and physical examination**
Age is one of the most important factors to take into account when
considering the possible causes of cardiomyopathy. For example, inher-­
ited metabolic disorders and congenital dysmorphic syndromes are
more common in neonates and infants (see *Section 6.9.1* ) than in older
children or adults, whereas wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis
(ATTRwt) is a disease mostly of adults over the age of 65 years (see
*Section 7.6* ).

Construction of a three- to four-generation family pedigree helps to
identify Mendelian forms of inheritance and identifies other family
members who may be at risk of disease development. [62] Specific fea-­
tures to note in the family history include premature deaths (taking
into account that SCDs may sometimes be reported as accidental
deaths, e.g. drowning, unexplained traffic accident, and, rarely, as still-­
birth or sudden infant death syndromes), unexplained heart failure, car-­
diac transplantation, pacemaker and defibrillator implants, and evidence
for systemic disease (e.g. stroke at a young age, skeletal muscle weak-­
ness, renal dysfunction, diabetes, deafness). Most Mendelian forms of
cardiomyopathy are autosomal dominant and are therefore character-­
ized by the presence of affected individuals across generations, with
transmission from parents of either sex (including male-to-male) and
a 50% risk of allele transmission to offspring (although, due to incom-­
plete penetrance, the proportion of affected individuals in an individual
pedigree will be lower). X-linked inheritance should be suspected if
males are the most severely affected individuals and there is no
male-to-male transmission. Autosomal recessive inheritance, the least

common pattern, is likely when both parents of the proband are

unaffected and consanguineous, although severe autosomal recessive
cardiomyopathies can also occur in the absence of familial consanguin-­
ity. [67][,][68] When women—but *not* men—transmit the disease to children

of either sex, mitochondrial DNA variants should be considered

( *Table 5* ). It is important to note that the absence of familial disease
does not exclude a genetic origin (see *Section 6.8* ).

Patients with cardiomyopathy may experience dyspnoea, chest pain,
palpitation, and syncope and/or pre-syncope, although many individuals
complain of few, if any, symptoms (see *Section 6.4* for assessment of
symptoms in specific cardiomyopathy subtypes). A number of noncardiac symptoms act as pointers for specific diagnoses ( *Table 6* ).
Similarly, general physical examination can provide diagnostic clues in
patients with syndromic or metabolic causes of cardiomyopathy. [62]


**6.5. Resting and ambulatory**
**electrocardiography**
The resting 12-lead ECG is often the first test that suggests the possi-­
bility of cardiomyopathy. Although the ECG can be normal in a small
proportion of individuals with cardiomyopathy, standard ECG abnor-­
malities are common in all cardiomyopathy subtypes and can precede
the development of an overt morphological or functional phenotype
by many years; for example, in genotype-positive individuals identified
during family screening. When interpreted in conjunction with findings
on echocardiography and CMR imaging, features that would normally
indicate other conditions, such as myocardial ischaemia or infarction,
can—with age at diagnosis, inheritance pattern, and associated clinical
features—suggest an underlying diagnosis or provide clues to the

underlying diagnosis. For this reason, the ECG is recommended at the
first clinic visit in all individuals with known or suspected cardiomyop-­
athy and should be repeated whenever there is a change in symptoms
in patients with an established diagnosis. Although the ECG is often
non-specific, there are particular features that can suggest a certain aeti-­
ology or morphological diagnosis, including atrioventricular (AV) block,
ventricular pre-excitation pattern, distribution of repolarization abnor-­
malities, and high or low QRS voltages ( *Table 7* ).

Patients with cardiomyopathy may seek cardiology evaluation due
to arrhythmia-related symptoms or documented arrhythmia,


including bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias, ranging from symp-­
tomatic atrial/ventricular premature beats to life-threating ventricular
arrhythmias. The frequency of arrhythmias detected during ambula-­
tory electrocardiographic monitoring is age related and variable
across different cardiomyopathy subtypes. Some arrhythmias are
relatively common in the context of cardiomyopathy (e.g. atrial fibril-­
lation [AF] or ventricular premature beats), while others may suggest
a specific diagnosis. ECG monitoring is therefore useful at the initial
clinical assessment and at regular intervals to assess the risk of SCD

and stroke.

**6.6. Laboratory tests**
Routine laboratory testing aids the detection of extracardiac conditions
that cause or exacerbate ventricular dysfunction (e.g. thyroid disease,
renal dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus) and secondary organ dysfunc-­
tion in patients with severe heart failure. High levels of brain natriuretic
peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP),
and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) are associated with
cardiovascular events, heart failure, and death, and may have diagnostic,
prognostic, and therapeutic monitoring value. [69] Routine blood tests for
comorbidities, including full blood count, renal and liver function para-­
meters and electrolytes, thyroid function, fasting glucose, and
Haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) are recommended in all patients with
heart failure symptoms. [69] Persistently elevated serum creatinine kinase
(CK) levels can be suggestive of myopathies or neuromuscular disor-­
ders including dystrophinopathies (e.g. Becker muscular dystrophy or
X-linked DCM), laminopathies, desminopathies, or less often, a myofi-­
brillar myopathy. [62] Elevated C-reactive protein levels may be present in
patients with ARVC and NDLVC, particularly in the context of recur-­
rent myocarditis-like episodes. [70] Elevated serum levels of iron and fer-­
ritin and high transferrin saturation can suggest a diagnosis of
haemochromatosis and should trigger further aetiological refinement
(primary vs. secondary) based on genetic testing. Lactic acidosis, myo-­
globinuria, and leucocytopaenia can be suggestive of mitochondrial dis-­
eases. A list of recommended laboratory tests in adults and children is
shown in *Table 8* . Following specialist evaluation, additional tests to de-­
tect rare metabolic causes are often required in children, including
measurement of lactate, pyruvate, pH, uric acid, ammonia, ketones,
free fatty acids, carnitine profile, urine organic acids, and amino acids
(see *Section 6.9* ).

**6.7. Multimodality imaging**

**6.7.1. General considerations**

Non-invasive imaging modalities represent the backbone of diagnosis
and follow-up in patients with cardiomyopathies, including ultrasoundbased techniques, CMR imaging, computed tomography (CT), and nu-­
clear techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and scin-­
tigraphy ( *Figure 6* ). [1][,][71][,][72] Physicians should always consider the yield of
actionable results vs. the costs, advantages, and limitations of each tech-­
nique, as well as patient safety and patient exposure to ionizing radi-­
ation and contrast media. Standardized algorithms should be in place


to move hierarchically from simpler and cheaper to more complex
and expensive tests. A bi-directional flow of information between the
clinician and the imager is key to maximizing appropriateness: clinicians
should formulate and share clear pre-test hypotheses, based on avail-­
able information, to aid the interpretation of novel findings. The imager
should respond in a similarly focused fashion, assessing the likelihood of
alternative diagnoses and refraining from diagnoses that are not com-­
patible/plausible based on the overall clinical context.

**6.7.2. Echocardiography**

The non-invasive nature and widespread availability of echocardiography
make it the main imaging tool, from initial diagnosis to follow-up.
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) provides relevant information
on global and regional RV and LV anatomy and function as well as valve
function and the presence of dynamic obstruction, pulmonary hyperten-­
sion, or pericardial effusions. [71][–][73] Myocardial deformation imaging
(speckle tracking or tissue Doppler) with global longitudinal strain is a
more sensitive marker than EF to detect subtle ventricular dysfunction
(e.g. in genotype-positive HCM, DCM, and ARVC family mem-­
bers [72][,][74][,][75] ), and may help discriminate between different aetiologies of
hypertrophy [76] (e.g. amyloidosis, HCM, and athlete’s heart). Mechanical
dispersion is a marker of contraction inhomogeneity and highlights fine
structural changes that may be missed by other modalities. [77][–][80]

Three-dimensional echocardiography reliably assesses volumes of car-­
diac chambers but needs an adequate acoustic window. Contrast agents
can be considered for better endocardial delineation to depict the pres-­
ence of hypertrabeculation, apical HCM, or apical aneurysms, and to ex-­
clude thrombus. Stress echocardiography can be helpful in selected
patients to evaluate myocardial ischaemia and exercise echocardiography
is useful to identify provocable LVOTO in symptomatic patients with
HCM (see *Section 7.1.1.3* ). Transoesophageal echocardiography is limited
to selected indications, such as the exclusion of atrial thrombi related to
AF, elucidating the mechanism of mitral regurgitation, or in planning inva-­
sive interventions (e.g. septal myectomy in HCM).

When measuring cardiac dimensions and wall thickness in children, it
is important to correct for body size, using z-scores (defined as the
number of standard deviations from the population mean). Of note,
there are inherent limitations with the use of z-scores in the diagnosis
of cardiomyopathies, including the fact that there are many different
normative data published resulting in significant variation in z-scores
for the same patient. [81] In addition, there are no normative data for
wall thickness other than at the basal interventricular septum or poster-­
ior wall. The Task Force recommends using the normative data from
the Paediatric Heart Network consortium. [82]

**6.7.3. Cardiac magnetic resonance**

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combines the advantages of
non-invasiveness and independence of acoustic window with the ability
for tissue characterization. The latter advantage is particularly import-­
ant in the diagnosis of NDLVC, ARVC, myocarditis, amyloidosis, sar-­
coidosis and other forms of inflammatory disease, and iron overload/
haemochromatosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance is particularly useful
if echocardiography provides poor image quality. Initial evaluation
should routinely include cine imaging sequences, T2-weighted se-­
quences, pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping, and late gadolinium en-­
hancement (LGE). When suspecting haemochromatosis, T2*
mapping should be employed. Cardiac magnetic resonance findings
can provide important aetiological clues ( *Figure 7* ), with potential thera-­
peutic implications ( *Table 9* ) and should be assessed collectively with
genetic results and other clinical features by experienced operators
in cardiac imaging and the evaluation of heart muscle disease. Serial
follow-up CMR, every 2–5 years depending on initial severity and clin-­
ical course, can assist in evaluating disease progression as well as the
benefits of therapy (e.g. evaluation of extracellular volume [ECV] in


amyloidosis, or of iron deposition in haemochromatosis), and should
be considered in all patients with cardiomyopathy.

*6.7.3.1. Special considerations*

- Recently developed rapid CMR techniques allow scans to be performed
without general anaesthesia even in very young children. [103] In children
(and adults) unable to undergo CMR without general anaesthesia, the
relative risks and benefits of the procedure should be considered.

- Imaging artefacts caused by cardiac implantable electronic devices
have posed limitations for CMR imaging in the past. [104][–][110] A number
of solutions are available to reduce artefacts, including reducing in-­
homogeneity, technical adjustments, and the use of special sequences,
which reduce the rate of uninterpretable studies to one in five. [111][,][112]

Cardiac magnetic resonance can therefore be considered in patients
with conditional devices and nearly all non-conditional devices pro-­
vided appropriate protocols are put in place. [113]

- Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a rare complication reported in pa-­

tients with first-generation linear unstable gadolinium chelates and

severe renal disease. [114] However, gadolinium-based contrast agents
can be safely administered for patients with an estimated glomerular fil-­
tration rate >30 mL/min/1.73 m [2], and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is
virtually unreported with the use of newer linear or macrocyclic gado-­
linium contrasts. For patients with severe renal impairment, new CMR
modalities and mapping procedures, which are very informative and do
not require the use of contrast, are particularly valuable when assessing
Anderson–Fabry disease and cardiac amyloidosis. [115][–][117]

- The use of gadolinium contrast is generally not advised in pregnancy
due to the potential for adverse outcomes in the foetus and
neonate. [118]

**6.7.4. Computed tomography and nuclear medicine**
**techniques**

Other imaging modalities, including nuclear medicine-based techniques
and CT, are indicated in selected subsets of patients with cardiomyop-­
athy. [160][,][161] Indications and the risk-benefit ratio should be evaluated on
an individual patient basis, always taking into account radioprotection
issues, which are particularly relevant in the young. Nuclear medicine
is particularly helpful in the aetiological diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis
(see *Section 7.7* ). 18FDG-PET is useful in the identification of myocardial
inflammation associated with active sarcoidosis and, potentially, in
other atypical forms of myocarditis. [162][–][164] However, a negative scan
does not exclude sarcoidosis in its inactive form. In patients with
HCM, DCM, and Anderson–Fabry disease, H 152 O or 13 NH 3 dipyrid-­
amole or regadenoson PET has been used to evaluate microvascular
dysfunction, an important predictor of adverse outcome. [165]

However, this test does not currently have a role in aetiological diagno-­
sis (e.g. in distinguishing phenocopies) and is largely confined to re-­
search purposes.

Computed tomography-based imaging is primarily used in patients
with a suspicion of cardiomyopathy to rule out CAD, either as an alter-­
native diagnosis (e.g. in individuals with DCM, NDLVC, or ARVC phe-­
notypes) or as a comorbidity affecting clinical manifestations and
course. In children and adolescents, CT angiography can be useful to ex-­

**6.7.5. Endomyocardial biopsy**
Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with immunohistochemical quantifica-­
tion of inflammatory cells and identification of viral genomes remains
the gold standard for the identification of cardiac inflammation. It
may confirm the diagnosis of autoimmune disease in patients with un-­
explained heart failure and suspected giant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic
myocarditis, vasculitis, and sarcoidosis. Electron microscopy should be
employed when storage or mitochondrial cardiomyopathies are sus-­
pected. Endomyocardial biopsy should be reserved for specific situa-­
tions where its results may affect treatment after careful evaluation
of the risk-benefit ratio. Importantly, EMB is not completely risk-free
and should be performed by experienced teams. Likewise, the diagnos-­
tic work-up of a biopsy should be performed by pathologists with ex-­
pertise in cardiomyopathies.

**6.8. Genetic testing and counselling**

**6.8.1. Genetic architecture**

Familial forms of cardiomyopathies show diverse modes of inheritance.
Gene identification has, over the last three decades, primarily focused
on the identification of Mendelian (monogenic) disease genes that most
commonly display autosomal dominant inheritance, although other inher-­
itance patterns including autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial
(matrilineal) are also observed ( *Table 5* ). Major genes currently associated
with different types of cardiomyopathies are listed in *Table 10* .
Cardiomyopathies are characterized by a marked genetic and allelic het-­
erogeneity, that is, many different variants in many different genes can
cause the same phenotype. Rare pathogenic variants associated with car-­
diomyopathies often exhibit the phenomena of incomplete and
age-related penetrance, and variable expressivity. [178][,][179] That is, not all in-­
dividuals carrying a causative variant manifest the disease and, among those
who do, there is broad variability in age of onset and disease severity. Thus,
while some individuals may have severe disease necessitating cardiac trans-­
plantation at a young age, others may remain unaffected throughout their
lives or are only mildly affected. This variability could be due to heterogen-­
eity among causative variants, the additional contribution of non-genetic
(clinical, environmental) factors (e.g. hypertension in HCM, [180] exercise
in ARVC [181] ), and the co-inheritance of additional genetic factors, which
act to exacerbate or attenuate the effect of the principal Mendelian genetic
variant on the phenotype. This is an active area of research, and recent
genome-wide association studies conducted in patients with HCM have
provided strong evidence for the modulatory role of common genetic var-­
iants of individually small effect that collectively modulate the effects of
Mendelian variants ( *Figure 8* ). [182][,][183]

Across the different cardiomyopathies, the proportion of cases with a
confident genetic diagnosis (that is with identification of a likely causal
Mendelian genetic variant) is relatively low (e.g. as low as ∼40% in
HCM [124] and ∼30% in DCM [184][–][186] ). Genome-wide association studies
of common variants in HCM and DCM have provided empirical evi-­
dence for substantial polygenic inheritance in these cardiomyop-­
athies. [182][,][183][,][187] Contrary to Mendelian inheritance, where a single,
large-effect variant primarily determines susceptibility to the disorder,
complex inheritance rests on the co-inheritance of multiple susceptibil-­
ity variants. Although not yet studied systematically, besides common
variants of small effect, intermediate-effect variants with effect sizes
and frequencies between common and Mendelian variants are also ex-­
pected to contribute to such complex inheritance. [188] It is likely that car-­
diomyopathies span a continuum of genetic complexity, with Mendelian
forms at one end, determined primarily by the inheritance of an ultrarare large-effect genetic variant, and highly polygenic forms at the other
(see *Figure 8* ). Variants that contribute to disease susceptibility in the set-­
ting of complex inheritance likely overlap with those that modulate dis-­
ease penetrance and expressivity in the Mendelian form of the
disease. [182][,][183]

**6.8.2. Genetic testing**

Genetic testing of Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes has become a
standard aspect of clinical management in affected families. [3] First-line
testing should be focused on genes robustly associated with the pre-­
senting phenotype. If initial testing does not reveal a cause, but suspicion
of a monogenic cause remains high, then more extended sequencing or
analysis may be indicated, depending on the family structure and other


factors. Once a genetic cause is established in one family member, then
other family members may undergo testing for only the causative

variant.

Genetic testing in an individual with cardiomyopathy (known as *con-­*
*firmatory testing* or diagnostic testing) is recommended for their direct
benefit: (i) to confirm the diagnosis; (ii) where it may inform prognosis;
(iii) where it may inform treatment selection; or (iv) where it may in-­
form their reproductive management. Genetic testing of an affected in-­
dividual may be indicated, even if it is unlikely to alter their management,
if there are *relatives* who may benefit from testing, particularly if there
are relatives who will be enrolled in longitudinal surveillance if the gen-­
etic aetiology is not established and who may be spared this burden if a
genetic diagnosis is made in the family ( *Table 11* ). Testing may also be
helpful in broader contexts, even when not obviously informative for
immediate management; for example, a genetic diagnosis may provide
psychological benefit in a patient struggling to understand their disease.

Genetic testing in a clinically unaffected relative of an individual with
cardiomyopathy may be indicated irrespective of age, even in very
young children, if a genetic diagnosis has been established with confi-­
dence in the affected individual (known as *cascade testing*, predictive
testing, or pre-symptomatic testing). Once a pathogenic/likely patho-­
genic (P/LP) variant has been identified within an index patient following
investigations of relevant disease genes associated with the specific
phenotype, it is possible to offer cascade genetic testing of first-degree
at-risk relatives, including pre-test genetic counselling (see *Section*
*6.8.3* ). In a scenario where a first-degree relative has died, evaluation
of close relatives of the deceased individual (i.e. second-degree relatives
of the index patient) should also be considered.

Individuals who are found not to harbour the familial variant can usu-­
ally be discharged from clinical follow-up; those who do carry the famil-­
ial variant are recommended to undergo clinical evaluation and usually
ongoing surveillance. Cascade testing is not indicated when a variant of
uncertain significance is identified in the proband.

Sequencing may also be indicated for segregation analysis (rather
than as a diagnostic test) to inform interpretation of a variant of uncer-­
tain significance found in an affected individual. This is usually limited to
individuals who are clearly affected, or to testing of the parents to iden-­
tify a *de novo* variant. Genetic counselling in this circumstance would in-­
volve clear communication to family members that this is not a
diagnostic test, but rather is contributing to clarifying the pathogenicity

of the uncertain variant.

Finally, the evaluation of cardiac genes for secondary findings where data
are generated in the setting of genetic testing for another clinical indication
(also referred to as opportunistic screening) may be reasonable where the
balance of benefits and harm is known, and if the cost is acceptable.
Broader population screening might also prove reasonable if the balance
of benefits and harm proves favourable. At present there is insufficient
data to evaluate the balance of benefits and harm in either context, and
this should currently only be performed in a research context in order
to obtain such data. Careful genetic counselling to fully explain benefits
and risks in this setting is critical. At present, there are very little data to
evaluate this balance and this is an important evidence gap. In the United
States of America, the American College of Medical Genetics and
Genomics has recommended that cardiomyopathy-associated genes be
evaluated for secondary findings whenever broad clinical sequencing is
undertaken, regardless of the initial indication for testing. [192][,][193] There is
currently no international consensus around this recommendation.

Figure 8 The genetic architecture of the cardiomyopathies. GWAS, genome-wide association studies; MAF, minor allele frequency. Cardiomyopathy can be
Mendelian, caused by genetic variants that are ultra-rare in the general population and have large effect sizes. Such variants can display complete penetrance; i.e. all
individuals with the variant in the family manifest the disease (panel A). However, individual variants are often insufficient to yield a disease phenotype in isolation, and
their effect is modulated by the co-inheritance of modulatory genetic factors and by non-genetic factors (panel B). Besides increasing disease penetrance, such mod-­
ulatory variants also affect the severity of the disease (panel B). Modulatory genetic factors are thought to comprise common variants with individually small-effect
sizes and intermediate-effect variants that have population frequencies and effect sizes between rare and common variants. Some patients have a more complex
aetiology (non-Mendelian/polygenic inheritance) in which a substantial number of non-Mendelian genetic factors and non-genetic factors are required to reach the
threshold for disease (panel C). Such patients typically have a sporadic presentation or present with a less pronounced familial clustering of the disease. Family trees
demonstrate the male (square) and female (circle) family members that are affected (black filled), with incomplete phenotype (grey filled) or unaffected (white filled).
The presence or absence of the variant of interest is noted with “+” or “-”, respectively.

*6.8.2.1. Non-Mendelian cardiomyopathies and implications for*
*genetic testing*

The preceding discussion has focused on genetic testing to identify
monogenic forms of cardiomyopathy. The recognition that an import-­
ant proportion of cardiomyopathies have a more complex genetic
architecture has important implications for the use of genetic tests.

The absence of a monogenic disease-causing variant on conventional
genetic testing (i.e. sequencing for rare variants of large effect) leaves
three possibilities: (i) either there is a monogenic cause that has not
been identified (i.e. not detected or recognized as causative by current
testing); (ii) the cardiomyopathy does not have a genetic aetiology; or
(iii) the cardiomyopathy is attributable to the effects of multiple variants
of individually smaller effect ( *Figure 8* ). Recent data suggest that for many
cardiomyopathies, the absence of a rare causative variant on comprehen-­
sive testing indicates that the disease is unlikely to have a monogenic aeti-­
ology. [182][,][183][,][194] This, in turn, implies a different inheritance pattern, with a
lower risk to first-degree relatives, such that ongoing surveillance may
not be indicated if an initial clinical evaluation is reassuring. The use of gen-­
etic testing to identify families in whom the disease is unlikely to be
monogenic represents a likely new application of conventional testing,
which is gathering evidence but not yet established.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) (sometimes known as genomic risk
scores) are another form of genetic test that may, in the future, have
relevance in the management of cardiomyopathies. Instead of trying
to identify a single genetic variant that is responsible for disease,
many variants across the genome are evaluated, each associated with
a small effect on disease risk, and a score representing the aggregate
risk is calculated. [182][,][183][,][195][–][197] To date, the value of a PRS in the clinical

management of cardiomyopathies has not yet been demonstrated, and
access to genetic counselling will be even more important in conveying
risks and uncertainties to patients and families.

*6.8.2.2. Genetic test reports and variant interpretation*

Many genetic diagnostic laboratories use a standardized framework to
interpret and report diagnostic genetic test results. [3][,][198][–][200] A negative
genetic test result in a proband indicates that no causative variant has
been found in a known disease-associated gene. This does not necessar-­
ily mean the patient does not have a genetic disease, but reflects our
limited knowledge of the genetic architecture of inherited cardiomyop-­
athies at this point in time. Aspects concerning the genetic testing ap-­
proach, genetic testing methods, and variant interpretation are
[further elaborated in the Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data) *Section 2*, and in

**6.8.3. Genetic counselling**

Genetic counselling is a process that aims to support patients and their
families to understand and adapt to the medical, psychosocial, and familial
impact of genetic diseases. [201][,][202] It should be performed by healthcare
professionals with specific training, such as genetic counsellors, genetic
nurses, or clinical/medical geneticists, regardless of whether genetic testing
is being considered. Genetic counselling can include a discussion of inher-­
itance risks, provide education including the need for clinical evaluation,
perform pre- and post-genetic test counselling, review variant classifica-­
tions, obtain a three-generation family history, and provide psychosocial
support. [203][–][205] For patients with a new diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, there
can be difficulty adjusting to life with an inherited cardiomyopathy, chal-­
lenges living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and on-­
going trauma and grief for those who have experienced a young SCD in
their family. Attention to the psychological support needs of patients is
therefore critical (see *Section 6.12* ). Indeed, in the general setting, genetic
counselling can improve knowledge, recall, and patient empowerment; in-­
crease satisfaction with decision-making; and reduce anxiety. [206][–][209]


*6.8.3.1. Genetic counselling in children*
There are specific issues to be considered when counselling children
and their families and considering clinical screening and cascade genetic
testing, [75][,][210][,][211] ( *Table 12* ) and a patient-centred approach that takes in

to account the experiences and values of the family is needed ( *Figure 9* ).
The guiding principle remains that any testing, clinical or genetic, should
be in the best interests of the child and have an impact on management,
lifestyle, and/or ongoing clinical testing. [75] With appropriate multidiscip-­
linary support in a paediatric setting, psychosocial outcomes in children
undergoing clinical screening and cascade genetic testing are no differ-­
ent than those of the general population. [212]

*6.8.3.2. Pre- and post-test genetic counselling (proband)*
One critical role for genetic counselling is that it should be done along-­
side genetic testing (see *Section 6.8.2* ). [3] This includes a discussion prior
to a decision to undertake genetic testing (pre-test), and at the time of


the return of the results (post-test). Key discussion points during preand post-test counselling are summarized in *Table 13* .

*6.8.3.3. Genetic counselling for cascade testing*
Once a P/LP variant has been identified within an index patient follow-­
ing investigations of relevant disease genes associated with the specific
phenotype, it is possible to offer cascade genetic testing of first-degree
at-risk relatives, including pre-test genetic counselling (see *Section 6.8* ).
In a scenario where a first-degree relative has died, evaluation of close
relatives of the deceased individual (i.e. second-degree relatives of the
index patient) should also be considered.

Modified from Ingles *et al.* [213]




The right assignment of the level of pathogenicity of a variant is cru-­
cial for cascade genetic testing. Inappropriate use of genetic testing in a
family has the potential to introduce unnecessary worry and fear, as
well as potential harm related to the misinterpretation of genetic var-­
iants. Variants should therefore be classified by a specialized multidiscip-­
linary cardiac genetic team with an appropriate level of expertise.
Systematic reclassification of identified variants and communication
to families is crucial. Conveying information on the importance of clin-­
ical and genetic testing of at-risk relatives is typically reliant on the pro-­
band in the family understanding the information and passing it on to
the appropriate relatives. Common barriers to communication can in-­
clude poor family relationships, guilt regarding passing a causative vari-­
ant on to children, psychosocial factors including distress, and
comprehension of the result. [214][,][215] A patient will often selectively com-­
municate genetic information to relatives, assessing their ability to
understand and cope with the information, their life stage, and their
risk status. [216] Poor health literacy is an important barrier to effectively
communicating genetic risk information to relatives, highlighting the
need for targeted resources and mechanisms for support. [217]


*6.8.3.4. Pre-natal or pre-implantation genetic diagnosis*
Pre-natal or pre-implantation genetic testing can be offered to par-­
ents who have had a previous affected child with an inherited cardio-­
myopathy due to a single or multiple pathogenic variant(s), or to
couples where one or both partners carries a known pathogenic (fa-­
milial) variant. The decision to pursue pre-natal or pre-implantation
genetic testing should consider a spectrum of disease- and
parent-related aspects, including cultural, religious, legal, and avail-­
ability issues. [218] Options for pre-natal or pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis should be discussed as part of the genetic counselling pro-­
cess and in a timely manner. If pre-natal diagnostics are performed, it
should be done early enough in pregnancy to give the patient options
regarding pregnancy continuation, or co-ordination of pregnancy, de-­
livery, and neonatal care. [219]

Options for pre-natal and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis are
summarized in *Table 14* . Most reproductive diagnostic testing op-­
tions are for established pregnancies, except pre-implantation genet-­
ic diagnosis which allows for selective implantation of unaffected
embryos.

**6.9. Diagnostic approach to paediatric**
**patients**
Traditionally, cardiomyopathies in children have been considered to be
distinct entities from adolescent and adult cardiomyopathies, with dif-­
ferent aetiologies, natural history, and management. Although substan-­
tially rarer than in adults, contemporary data have shown that, beyond
the first year of life, in most cases, paediatric cardiomyopathies re-­
present part of the spectrum of the same diseases that are seen in ado-­
lescents and adults. [245] Given their rarity, data on clinical management
and outcomes are more limited than in adults, but large populationbased or international consortium data have provided important
information on clinical presentation, natural history, and outcomes of
cardiomyopathies in children. [245] Paediatric-onset cardiomyopathies of-­
ten represent two opposite ends of the spectrum of heart muscle dis-­
ease: (i) severe, early-onset disease, with rapid disease progression and
poor prognosis, in keeping with the most severe presentations in adults;
or (ii) early phenotypic expression of adult cardiomyopathy
phenotypes, increasingly identified as a result of family screening. For
this reason, the Task Force highlights the principle of considering car-­
diomyopathies in all age groups as single disease entities, with recom-­
mendations applicable to paediatric and adult populations throughout
this guideline, accepting that the evidence base for many of the recom-­
mendations is significantly more limited for children. Where there are
age-related differences, these are specifically highlighted.

**3538** ESC Guidelines


The general approach to paediatric and adult cardiomyopathies is
based on age of onset, clinical presentation, and cardiac and systemic
phenotype. [246] When a syndromic or metabolic disease is suspected,
a step-by-step approach taking into consideration age of onset, consan-­
guinity and family history, cardiac and systemic involvement, ECG and
imaging, and laboratory work-up is recommended to define phenotype,
aetiology, and tailored management. [247] As in adults, clinical presenta-­
tion varies, from an absence of symptoms to SCD as the first and un-­
ique manifestation. [35][,][81][,][248][,][249]

**6.9.1. Infantile and early childhood-onset**
**cardiomyopathy**

In contrast, the aetiology, natural history, and outcomes of
infant-onset (<1 year of age) cardiomyopathies can be substantially
different than those seen in older children, adolescents, and adults.


In infantile and early childhood-onset cardiomyopathies, clinical
presentation, cardiac phenotype, and aetiology are the main determi-­
nants of management. [2] Severe clinical onset of infantile cardiomyop-­
athies is generally managed in intensive or subintensive care units by
neonatologists and paediatric cardiologists, for respiratory distress
and/or metabolic acidosis, and/or hypoglycaemia, and/or hypo-­
tonia. [247][,][250][–][252] A comprehensive clinical approach, taking into con-­
sideration both the cardiac and systemic phenotype (consanguinity;
dysmorphisms or skeletal anomalies; mental retardation; muscle
hypotonia and weakness; hypoglycaemia with or without metabolic
acidosis; increased CK and transaminases; presence of urine ketones,
organic aciduria, acylcarnitine, and free fatty acid profiles; and calcium
and vitamin D metabolism), and involving a multidisciplinary team
(geneticist and experts in metabolic and neurological diseases), is
mandatory to guide management when reversible or specific diseases
are present ( *Figure 10* ).

ESC Guidelines **3539**


In infants with HCM, after exclusion of reversible causes (maternal dia-­
betes, [253] twin–twin syndrome, corticosteroid use [254][,][255] ), it is important to
define, along with the pattern of hypertrophy (asymmetric, concentric, bi-­
ventricular), the presence of LVOTO, diastolic and/or systolic dysfunc-­
tion, [1][,][256] and RV involvement. Early-onset sarcomeric disease (including
double/compound variants) should be excluded even in the absence of a
family history for HCM and SCD; these infants present with severe heart
failure symptoms, and survival beyond the first year of life is uncommon. [257]

In contrast, clinical presentation with heart failure is rare in infants with het-­
erozygous sarcomeric disease compared with malformation syndromes or
metabolic disorders, in whom survival rates are <90% and <70% at 1 year,
respectively. [248][,][258][,][259] In infants with HCM, in the presence of biventricular
outflow tract obstruction and ≥1 red flag for a neurocardiofaciocutaneous
syndrome (dysmorphisms, cutaneous abnormalities, skeletal anomalies,
etc.), a diagnosis of RASopathies should be strongly suspected. [260][–][263]

Severe LVOTO in RASopathy-related HCM often requires high-dose
beta blockade and, in some cases, consideration of septal myectomy. [264][– ]

267 In infants with HCM, biventricular hypertrophy, often presenting
with signs of heart failure and systolic dysfunction, and ≥1 red flag for meta-­
bolic disease (muscle hypotonia, increased CK, and transaminases, consan-­
guinity or matrilineal pattern of inheritance), it is mandatory to exclude
inborn errors of metabolism, including glycogenosis type II (Pompe dis-­
ease), fatty acid oxidation defects, and mitochondrial disorders. [268][–][272] In
infants with Pompe disease, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has
been shown to result in reversal of LVH. [269][,][273][–][275]

In infants with DCM, reversible causes (i.e. hypocalcaemic vitamin
D-dependent rickets) and CHD (aortic coarctation and ALCAPA, re-­
quiring immediate surgical management) should be ruled out. [249][,][276][,][277]

Viral myocarditis should also be excluded by non-invasive (i.e. laboratory)
and invasive (EMB) investigations, in selected cases. [278][,][279] Neuromuscular
(dystrophin- and sarcoglycan-related cardiomyopathies) should be ex-­
cluded in patients presenting with muscle hypotonia and increased CK,
and a multidisciplinary approach involving a neurologist and experts in
metabolic disease is required. [280][–][282] When a DCM phenotype is asso-­
ciated with LV hypertrabeculation, other mitochondrial/metabolic dis-­
eases, including Barth syndrome, should be considered. [283][–][285]

Isolated RCM is rare in infants, but a mixed RCM/HCM phenotype is
more frequently encountered. Familial cases are frequent, particularly
in patients with an RCM/HCM phenotype. [286][–][289] Independently of
the phenotype, it is generally associated with poor prognosis, though
the RCM/HCM phenotype has significantly better transplant-free sur-­
vival than isolated RCM. [286]

Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy and non-dilated LV cardiomy-­
opathy phenotypes are very rare in infants, and are most commonly

autosomal recessive forms associated with cutaneous manifestations
(e.g. Naxos disease and Carvajal syndrome), [290][–][292] although this may
reflect a lack of systematic clinical screening for these conditions in early
childhood. Recent data suggest that ∼15% of ARVC patients present
with paediatric-onset disease and paediatric ARVC patients more often
present with severe phenotype and higher risk of SCD. [293] Increasingly,
children with ARVC and NDLVC phenotypes presenting with acute
myocarditic presentations are recognized. [294][–][297]

**6.10. General principles in the**
**management of patients with**
**cardiomyopathy**
**6.10.1. Assessment of symptoms**

Some people with subtle structural abnormalities with cardiomyopathy
remain asymptomatic and have a normal lifespan; however, others may


develop symptoms, often many years after the appearance of ECG or
imaging evidence of disease. In infants, symptoms and signs of heart fail-­
ure include tachypnoea, poor feeding, excessive sweating, and failure to
thrive. Older children, adolescents, and adults complain of fatigue and
dyspnoea as well as chest pain, palpitations, and syncope. Because the
New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification to grade heart fail-­
ure is not applicable to children under the age of 5 years, the Ross
Heart Failure classification has been adopted in children <5 years of
age but has not been validated against outcomes. [298] Systematic
two-dimensional (2D) and Doppler echocardiography, resting and am-­
bulatory ECG monitoring, and exercise testing are usually sufficient to
determine the most likely cause of symptoms. Additional investigations
(e.g. coronary CT scanning or coronary angiography, cardio-pulmonary
exercise testing [CPET], electrophysiological study, loop recorder im-­
plantation) should be considered to investigate specific symptoms of
chest pain, syncope, and palpitation, according to established clinical
practice and guidelines. [1][,][4][,][69][,][299][–][301] Cardiac catheterization to evaluate
right and left heart function and pulmonary arterial resistance, and
CPET with simultaneous measurement of respiratory gases, is not a
standard part of the work-up, but remains recommended in severely
symptomatic patients with systolic and/or diastolic LV dysfunction
when uncertainty about filling status exists, or for those being consid-­
ered for heart transplantation or mechanical circulatory support. [69]

**6.10.2. Heart failure management**

The clinical management of heart failure has been described in the *2021 ESC*
*Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure* . [69] In
that document, recommendations are generally independent from the aeti-­
ology of heart failure and include current medical therapy, devices, and LV
assist device (LVAD)/transplantation. As such, the treatment recommenda-­
tions must be regarded as generic and not specific to the different forms of
cardiomyopathy. Medical therapies for HFrEF based on randomized con-­
trolled trials (RCTs) from large cohorts, including angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I)/angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors
(ARNIs), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA),
and sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), would be mostly
applicable to genetic DCM, NDLVC, and other phenotypes associated with
LV dysfunction (e.g. end-stage HCM, RCM, and ARVC). Indications for a
cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device and heart transplant
would also be generally applicable accordingly. Recommendations for man-­
agement of HFpEF would be mainly applicable to non-obstructive HCM,
RCM, and cardiac amyloidosis. A Focused Update is due to be published
in 2023. [69a]

Individual response to heart failure therapies may not be the same
for different specific genetic causes, as has been demonstrated in sev-­
eral observational studies. [302][,][303] Further management considerations
applicable to specific cardiomyopathy subtypes in adults and children,
and in particular contexts, such as pregnancy and rare metabolic geno-­
copies, are rapidly developing [304] and are discussed in the specific car-­
diomyopathy sections (see *Sections 7.6* and *8.2.2* ).

Cardiac amyloidosis and some forms of RCM deserve special consid-­
eration regarding heart failure management. Fluid control and mainten-­
ance of euvolaemia are central. If heart failure symptoms are present,
loop diuretics should be given, although orthostatic hypotension may
cause intolerance, and excessive fluid loss may worsen symptoms
due to restriction (e.g. in HCM or amyloidosis). The role of betablockers, ACE-Is, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or ARNIs in
the treatment of these patients has not been determined and they
may not be well tolerated because of hypotension. [305] Moreover,

**3540** ESC Guidelines


withdrawal of these drugs frequently leads to improvement in symp-­
toms and should be considered.

Heart failure with an LVEF >40–50% recovered from HFrEF or
HFmrEF (improved LVEF [306] ) is not separately considered in the *2021*
*ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart*
*failure*, but is particularly important for genetic DCM, as a substantial
proportion of patients with HFrEF or HFmrEF will improve their
LVEF with guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). [69] Patients
and physicians are faced with the dilemma of whether to continue life-­
long pharmacotherapy or wean at some point. The TRED-HF (Therapy

**—**
withdrawal in REcovered Dilated cardiomyopathy Heart Failure) trial
is the only RCT that evaluated if weaning GDMT is safe. The results
showed that a large proportion of the patients had recurrent LV dys-­
function or heart failure, so current recommendations caution against
weaning. [307]

*6.10.2.1. Preventive heart failure medical therapy of asymptomatic*
*carriers/early disease expression*

Heart failure therapy should be guided according to the *2021 ESC*
*Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure*
for HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF in patients with cardiomyopathy and
heart failure symptoms. [69][,][69a] Evidence for treatment recommendations
in asymptomatic LV dysfunction is scarce, which presents a challenge
for genetic cardiomyopathies, where a sizeable proportion of the pa-­
tients are young with no or only mild symptoms, and where asymptom-­
atic patients are frequently discovered through cascade screening.
Because heart failure medication has proved to affect LV remodelling
in symptomatic patients with LV dysfunction, first-line heart failure
therapy may be considered in patients with early forms of DCM/
NDLVC to prevent progression of LV dilatation and dysfunction (e.g.
ACE-I, ARBs, beta-blockers and MRAs, Class IIb Level C). Biomarkers
may help to identify pre-symptomatic patients who might benefit
from early neuro-hormonal blockade. [308] The effect of heart failure
drugs to prevent progression into overt disease in genetic carriers of
DCM-/NDLVC-causing variants is currently unsettled. A placebocontrolled trial (EARLY-Gene trial) is under way to test the utility of
candesartan to prevent LV dysfunction/dilatation in this scenario
(EudraCT: 2021-004577-30).

Management in other asymptomatic affected patients with diagnoses
of HCM, ARVC, and RCM should be decided individually, as medication
has not been proved to affect disease expression.

There is no evidence to support the use of current pharmacological
agents for the prevention of disease development in non-affected car-­
riers. Randomized controlled trials are warranted in order to address
the value of new pharmacologic agents in this scenario. [309]

Heart failure therapies are given to children with cardiomyopathies,
applying the evidence from adults to children or based on a limited
number of clinical studies. [310] Heart failure therapies routinely used in
children with LV dysfunction are ACE-Is, beta-blockers, diuretics, and
aldosterone antagonists. Angiotensin receptor blockers are an alterna-­
tive for ACE-Is. Early results of the multicentric randomized control
PANORAMA-HF Trial and the subsequent Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval for ARNI in children have paved the
way for this newer class of drugs for paediatric patients with symptom-­
atic heart failure with systemic left ventricle systolic dysfunction, 1 year
of age and older. Dosing recommendations in younger children are cur-­
rently pending, [311] but for children <40 kg a starting dose of 1.6 mg/kg
titrated to a maximum of 3.1 mg/kg has been suggested. [312] There are
currently no clinical trial or efficacy data available for SGLT-2 inhibitors
in children.


*6.10.2.2. Cardiac transplantation*

Orthotopic cardiac transplantation should be considered in patients
with moderate-to-severe drug-refractory symptoms (NYHA function-­
al class III–IV) who meet standard eligibility criteria (see the *2021 ESC*
*Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart fail-­*
*ure* ). [69] This may include patients with RCM and HCM with normal LVEF
but severe drug-refractory symptoms (NYHA functional class III–IV)
caused by diastolic dysfunction. [313][–][316] In patients with refractory ven-­
tricular arrhythmias that cannot be solely attributed to an acute decom-­
pensation in the setting of end-stage heart failure, a comprehensive
evaluation of all potential therapeutic options (e.g. pharmacotherapy;
ventricular tachycardia [VT] ablation including epicardial access if indi-­
cated and feasible; cardiac sympathetic denervation in patients with
electrical storm and/or refractory polymorphic VT or rapid mono-­
morphic VT) should be undertaken before recommending cardiac
transplantation (see *Section 6.10.4* ).

increasingly used as a bridge to transplant. Long-term MCS should also
be considered as destination therapy for cardiomyopathy patients with
advanced heart failure despite optimal medical therapy who are not eli-­
gible for transplantation. [69]

**6.10.3. Management of atrial arrhythmias**
Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in all subtypes of
cardiomyopathies and is associated with an increased risk of
cardio-embolic events, heart failure, and death. [331][–][333] Data from

3208 consecutive adult patients in the EURObservational
Research Programme (EORP) Cardiomyopathy Registry showed
an AF prevalence of 28.2% at baseline and 31.1% during followup, [331][–][333] although it differed among cardiomyopathy types (see
*Table 15* ). Overall, annual incidence in this registry was
3.0%. [332][,][333] In patients with cardiomyopathies, the presence of AF
is associated with more severe symptoms, an increased prevalence
of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, and an increased

incidence of stroke and death (from any cause and from heart
failure). [332][,][334][–][336]

Both the *2020 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of at-­*
*rial fibrillation* and the *2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment*
*of acute and chronic heart failure* recommend an integrated and struc-­
tured approach to facilitate guideline-adherent management. The
Atrial Fibrillation Better Care (ABC) approach has been shown to re-­
duce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism, myocardial infarction,
and mortality in the general population. [337][–][361] Although this approach
has not been specifically assessed in patients with cardiomyopathies,
heart failure was present in ∼20% of the individuals of these studies
and, where specified, cardiomyopathy in ∼5.5–6.5%. In particular,
two RCTs support integrated care. [347][,][361] The RACE 3, combining
the components of the ABC pathway into structured care, resulted
in reduced AF burden and better rhythm control among 245 patients
with early persistent AF and stable heart failure (119 randomized to tar-­
geted and 126 to conventional therapy). [347] The mobile Atrial
Fibrillation App Trial (mAFA-II), which included 714 patients with heart
failure (21.5%), 54 with HCM (1.6%), and 105 with DCM (3.2%),
showed the superiority of integrated care supported by mobile tech-­
nology in the composite outcome of ‘ischaemic stroke/systemic
thrombo-embolism, death, and re-hospitalization’ (1.9% vs. 6.0%; haz-­
ard ratio [HR] 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.67; *P* <
0.001) and re-hospitalization rates (1.2% vs. 4.5%; HR 0.32; 95% CI,
0.17 to 0.60; *P* < 0.001). [361] Adherence to the mobile health technology
beyond 1 year was good, and was associated with a reduction in ad-­
verse clinical outcomes. [362]

*6.10.3.1. Anticoagulation*

Thrombo-embolic risk varies in different cardiomyopathy phenotypes
(see *Section 7* ). [332][,][363][–][367] Cardiac amyloidosis, HCM, and RCM [368] are
associated with a particularly increased risk of stroke. [332][,][365][,][369][,][370]

The EORP registry indicated a worse prognosis for the population
with cardiomyopathy and concurrent AF with an annual incidence of
stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) about three times higher in
the cardiomyopathy group with AF. [332][,][334] Hence, considering anticoa-­
gulation is key in patients with any type of AF or atrial flutter.

Importantly, patients with cardiomyopathy and AF have more
cardio-embolic risk factors, including greater age, more advanced
NYHA class and more frequent history of stroke/TIA, hypertension,


and diabetes mellitus, among others. [332][,][333] The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (con-­
gestive heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension, age
≥75 [doubled], diabetes, stroke [doubled]-vascular disease, age 65–
74, sex category [female]) score has not been specifically tested in pa-­
tients with cardiomyopathies, [369] and retrospective evidence suggests
that it may perform suboptimally with respect to stroke prediction in
HCM and ATTR amyloidosis. [334][,][365][,][371][–][374] For this reason, although
there are no RCTs evaluating the role of anticoagulation among pa-­
tients with HCM, given the high incidence of stroke, prophylactic antic-­
oagulation is recommended in all patients with HCM and
AF. [334][,][371][,][372][,][374] A similar recommendation is given in patients with
AF and RCM or cardiac amyloidosis. [375] In patients with DCM,
NDLVC, or ARVC and AF, chronic oral anticoagulation should be con-­
sidered on an individual basis, taking into consideration the
CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score, as proposed by the *2020 ESC Guidelines for*
*the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation* . [336] Atrial fibrillation is
a rare finding in children with genetic cardiomyopathies and no data
are available regarding the performance of CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc or any
other risk stratification score, nor the risk and benefit of prescribing
oral anticoagulation. There are no data on long-term prophylactic antic-­
oagulation in children with DCM in sinus rhythm.

In the general population, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
are preferred for the prevention of thrombo-embolic events in patients

with AF and without severe mitral stenosis and/or mechanical valve

prosthesis, as they have similar efficacy to vitamin K antagonists
(VKAs) but a lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage. [376] There are no
randomized data comparing direct oral anticoagulants with VKAs in pa-­
tients with cardiomyopathy, although data suggest that they may be
used in a similar manner as the general population. [373][,][374][,][377][–][380]

*6.10.3.2. Rate control*

Rate control should be considered in any patient with cardiomyopathy
presenting with AF. [336] A strict rate control (resting heart rate
<80 beats per minute [b.p.m.] and heart rate during moderate exercise
<110 b.p.m.) did not show any benefit over lenient rate control (resting
heart rate <110 b.p.m.) in RACE II [381] and a pooled analysis of RACE II
and AFFIRM. [382] However, only 8–12% of patients had a history of car-­
diomyopathy (type unspecified) in the RACE II trial, and only 10% of the
patients in RACE II and 17% of those in the pooled analysis had a history
of heart failure hospitalization or NYHA class II or III, respectively. [381][,][382]

No data are available for the different cardiomyopathy subtypes, but
observational studies suggest that higher heart rates are associated
with worse outcomes in patients with heart failure. [383][,][384]

Accordingly, the *2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment*
*of acute and chronic heart failure* consider lenient rate control to be ac-­
ceptable as an initial approach but to target a lower heart rate in case of
persistent symptoms or suspicion of associated tachycardia-induced
cardiac dysfunction. [69]

Very little data are available regarding the choice of pharmacological
treatment for rate control in patients with cardiomyopathies.
Beta-blockers are the preferred choice in patients with cardiomyop-­
athies given their long-established safety in the presence of LV dysfunc-­
tion. [385][,][386] Digoxin is an alternative, particularly in patients with
contraindication or intolerance to beta-blockers and among patients
with AF and heart failure symptoms (RATE-AF trial), having shown
no difference in quality of life (QoL) at 6 months compared with biso-­
prolol. [387] When administering digoxin, close monitoring of plasma drug

levels is needed, as observational data suggest higher mortality in pa-­
tients with AF, regardless of heart failure; the risk of death was related
to serum digoxin concentration and was highest in patients with con-­
centrations ≥1.2 ng/mL. On the contrary, a lower mortality with betablocker therapy in AF patients with concomitant heart failure has been
observed. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (ver-­
apamil or diltiazem) may only be used in patients with LVEF ≥40%. [336]

Atrioventricular node ablation is also an alternative in patients with
poor ventricular rate control despite medical treatment not eligible
for rhythm control by catheter ablation or in patients with biventricular
pacing. [336] In patients with symptomatic persistent AF (>6 months) un-­
suitable for AF ablation or in which AF ablation had failed, narrow QRS
and at least one admission for heart failure, AV node ablation in asso-­
ciation with CRT has been shown to be superior to rate control with
pharmacological therapy, reducing the composite outcome of death
due to heart failure, or hospitalization due to heart failure, or worsening
heart failure, [388] and all-cause mortality, [389] irrespective of baseline EF
(APAF-CRT Trial). Whether conduction system-pacing is a (better) al-­
ternative to CRT needs to be further explored with only one small
crossover trial (ALTERNATIVE-AF) comparing His-Bundle pacing
(HBP) and biventricular pacing in 50 patients with LVEF ≤40% with per-­
sistent AF undergoing AV node ablation. [390] In this study, both arms sig-­
nificantly improved LVEF at 9 months, with a small, but statistically
significant superiority with HBP. [69][,][336]

*6.10.3.3. Rhythm control*
Atrial fibrillation can result in haemodynamic and clinical decompensa-­
tion due to shortening of the diastolic filling time with rapid heart rates
and dependence on atrial contraction for LV filling. Therefore, mainten-­
ance of sinus rhythm is highly desirable and a rhythm control strategy is
preferred, particularly in the presence of symptoms.

Regarding long-term pharmacological treatment, [336] antiarrhythmic
drugs (AADs) have shown limited success in maintaining sinus rhythm
over time both in the general population and in patients with cardiomy-­
opathies, [391][–][393] show high rates of withdrawal due to intolerance, [394]

and, most importantly, are associated with significant side effects, includ-­
ing proarrhythmia and extracardiac side effects, and, in some cases (so-­
talol and class IA drugs, such as quinidine and disopyramide), increased
mortality. [394] As a consequence, a degree of caution is recommended
when using antiarrhythmic drugs in this population. Data on antiarrhyth-­
mic therapy for the specific management of AF in the context of genetic
cardiomyopathies other than HCM are scarce. It is important to note the
potential for proarrhythmia of class I antiarrhythmics, particularly in the
presence of significant structural heart disease; these should therefore be
used with caution. Antiarrhythmic drug–drug treatment has mostly been
limited to amiodarone or sotalol, as there are no available data regarding
other antiarrhythmics such as dofetilide or dronedarone. Importantly,
sotalol should not be used in patients with HFrEF, significant LVH, pro-­
longed QT, asthma, hypokalaemia, or creatinine clearance (CrCl)
<30 ml/min. Likewise, dronedarone should be avoided in patients with
recent decompensated heart failure or permanent AF as it has been
shown to increase mortality. [395][,][396]

Catheter ablation of AF is a safe and superior alternative to AAD ther-­
apy for maintenance of sinus rhythm, reducing AF-related symptoms, and
improving QoL, and can be considered an alternative to AAD therapy in
practically any type and context of AF. [336][,][397] In patients with AF and nor-­
mal LVEF, catheter ablation has not been shown to reduce total mortality
or stroke. [398] In selected patients with HFrEF, [399][–][401] ablation has shown a


reduction in all-cause mortality and hospitalizations, and should be con-­
sidered as a first-line option. In the general AF population, the Early
Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial

(EAST-AFNET 4) randomized 2789 patients with early AF and associated
cardiovascular comorbidities to an early rhythm control strategy or usual
care (28.6% with heart failure). [402] The trial was stopped early after a me-­
dian follow-up of 5.1 years for a lower occurrence of the primary out-­
come of death, stroke, or hospitalization for worsening heart failure or
acute coronary syndrome in the patients in the early rhythm control
group vs. those assigned to usual care. A pre-specified analysis evaluated
the effects in patients with heart failure, showing the benefit of early
rhythm control in this subgroup of patients, [403] findings which corrobo-­
rated those of the CABANA trial. [400] In patients with AF and heart failure,
several RCTs have demonstrated an improvement in outcomes with
catheter ablation when compared with medical therapy. [399][–][401][,][404][–][409]

Some observational studies in patients with HFpEF have also suggested
better results in terms of freedom from AF and all-cause mortality, [410]

but proper RCTs are warranted.

The role of catheter ablation in patients with cardiomyopathies has
been reported in several registries, mainly in HCM patients. [397][,][411][–][420]

Overall, maintenance is achieved in up to two-thirds of patients, although
repeat procedures or continuation of antiarrhythmic medications are of-­
ten necessary. [397][,][411][,][415][–][419] Patients with cardiomyopathies may have a
higher risk of AF recurrence, particularly in the presence of atrial remod-­
elling/dilatation. [397]

*6.10.3.4. Comorbidities and risk factor management*

Cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities are also more frequent
in patients with cardiomyopathies and AF. These include smoking,
alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlip-­
idaemia, renal impairment, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
valvular and ischaemic heart disease, and anaemia. [332][,][334]

Furthermore, these patients have a larger body mass index and report
less physical activity than those without AF. [332][,][334] These risk factors

and comorbidities are associated with the risk of AF and its

complications and should therefore be appropriately identified and
managed to prevent AF progression and the occurrence of adverse
outcomes. [336]

**6.10.4. Management of ventricular arrhythmias**

Ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in the form of electrical storm and/
or repetitive appropriate ICD interventions, contribute to a significant-­
ly increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with
cardiomyopathies. [299]


The *2022 ESC Guidelines for the management of patients with ventricu-­*
*lar arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death* provide de-­
tailed recommendations on acute and long-term management of
ventricular arrhythmias in patients with cardiomyopathies. [299] Limited
data exist addressing ventricular arrhythmia management in patients
with specific genetic cardiomyopathies. Nonetheless, some general
concepts can be highlighted:

- Any reversible cause and/or precipitating factor, such as electrolyte
imbalances, ischaemia, hypoxaemia, or drugs, should be identified
and corrected when possible.

- Extensive efforts should be made in the attempt to understand the
aetiology (i.e. underlying mechanism and substrate, and their relation-­
ship with the underlying cardiomyopathy) as this will influence the
choice of treatment.

- Acute termination of sustained ventricular arrhythmias can be
achieved with electrical cardioversion, AADs, or pacing. The initial
choice of treatment will depend on the haemodynamic tolerance,
the underlying aetiology, and the patient profile.

- In patients presenting with electrical storm, mild-to-moderate sed-­

ation is recommended to alleviate psychological distress and reduce
sympathetic tone. If the electrical storm remains intractable despite
antiarrhythmic therapies, deep sedation/intubation should be

considered.

- In case of incessant ventricular arrhythmias and electrical storm not
responding to antiarrhythmic medication, catheter ablation is recom-­
mended. In refractory cases or whenever VT ablation is either not in-­
dicated or not immediately available, autonomic modulation (i.e.
stellate ganglion block or cardiac sympathetic denervation, depending
on the setting) and/or MCS may be considered.

- In patients with cardiomyopathies and scar-related ventricular ar-­

rhythmias, the therapeutic arsenal for long-term prevention of recur-­
rent ventricular arrhythmias includes antiarrhythmic medications
(mostly limited to beta-blockers, sotalol, and amiodarone) and cath-­
eter ablation (particularly in the case of sustained monomorphic VT
or in the case of polymorphic VT triggered by a premature ventricu-­
lar complex of similar morphology). Additional strategies, performed
by experienced centres, may be considered, depending on the char-­
acteristics of the patient and the ventricular arrhythmia, including
acute neuromodulation strategies (stellate ganglion block and thor-­
acic epidural anaesthesia), chronic neuromodulation strategies (car-­
diac sympathetic denervation), and stereotactic non-invasive VT
ablation. [514][–][520] Limited data are available at present concerning the
long-term cardiac and extracardiac safety of stereotactic non-invasive
VT ablation, as well as the dose–response relationship, therefore its
usage should be limited to compassionate cases or within prospective

clinical studies.

- The acute as well as the chronic management of patients with cardio-­

myopathies and refractory ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in
case of concomitant moderate-to-severe ventricular dysfunction,
should involve an integrated evaluation by a heart team including car-­
diomyopathy specialists, electrophysiologists with specific experi-­
ence in catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias and
neuromodulation, anaesthesiologists, and cardiac surgeons.

**6.10.5. Device therapy: implantable cardioverter**
**defibrillator**
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators are effective at correcting poten-­
tially lethal ventricular arrhythmias and preventing SCD, but are also as-­
sociated with complications, particularly in young patients who will

ESC Guidelines **3545**


require several replacements during their lifetimes. Implantable cardio-­
verter defibrillators reduce mortality in survivors of cardiac arrest and
in patients who have experienced haemodynamically compromising
sustained ventricular arrhythmias. [521][–][523] An ICD is recommended in
such patients when the intent is to increase survival; the decision to im-­
plant should consider the patient’s view and their QoL, as well as the
absence of other diseases likely to cause death within the following

year.

Arrhythmic risk calculators may be useful tools to predict the risk of
SCD and, where available, they may provide a clinical benefit compared
with a risk factor approach. [524][–][526] The issue of the threshold for ICD
implantation may be a reasonable concern as every cut-off point comes
with a trade-off between unnecessary ICDs with their potential compli-­
cations vs. the potential for unprotected SCD. The relative weight of
these opposing undesirable events varies significantly from one person
to another and should be part of the individualized decision-making
process. Risk stratification strategies in each cardiomyopathy and the
role of ICDs for primary prevention are discussed in *Section 7* .

The *2022 ESC Guidelines for the management of patients with ventricu-­*
*lar arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death* provide de-­
tailed recommendations regarding optimal device programming and
prevention/treatment of inappropriate therapy. The implantation of
conditional devices is reasonable taking into account the expected
need for CMR during follow-up. In children, simpler ICD devices (e.g.
single chamber/single coil or subcutaneous) should be considered, bear-­
ing in mind specific issues of body size/shape and growth. The wearable
cardioverter defibrillator has been shown to detect and treat ventricu-­
lar arrhythmias successfully. [527] However, data on its benefit for primary
prevention other than the early phase of myocardial infarction (e.g.
myocarditis, PPCM etc.) are scarce and no recommendation can be
made at present.

**6.10.6. Routine follow-up of patients with**
**cardiomyopathy**

In general, patients with cardiomyopathy require lifelong follow-up to
detect changes in symptoms, risk of adverse events, ventricular func-­
tion, and cardiac rhythm.

The frequency of monitoring is determined by the severity of disease,
age, and symptoms. A clinical examination, including 12-lead ECG and
TTE, should be performed every 1–2 years, or sooner should patients
complain of new symptoms. Ambulatory electrocardiography is re-­
commended every 1–2 years in most patients to detect asymptomatic
atrial and ventricular arrhythmia, and is indicated whenever patients
experience syncope or palpitations. Cardiac magnetic resonance evalu-­
ation should be considered every 2–5 years or more frequently in pa-­
tients with progressive disease (see *Section 6.7.3* ). Cardio-pulmonary
exercise testing can provide objective evidence for worsening disease
but need only be performed every 2–3 years unless there is a change
in symptoms. Ergometry and treadmill exercise testing may also pro-­
vide valuable functional information in patients unable to perform

CPET.


history and other factors. In families where there is only one affected
individual and where no genetic variant has been identified, the fre-­
quency and duration of clinical follow-up may be reduced (see
*Figure 11* ).

Generally, the frequency of the clinical cardiac evaluation in relatives
will be based on the inheritance pattern, the risk of events in the af-­
fected individual(s), and the quality-adjusted life-year. It would also de-­
pend on age, type of cardiomyopathy, and family history (penetrance,
phenotype expression, and risk of complications in affected relatives).

Disease-penetrance studies have demonstrated a similar sigmoid
shape pattern of phenotypic expression throughout life in families
with confirmed genetic cardiomyopathies. The penetrance during child-­
hood is ∼5% during the first decade of life, increasing to 10–20% per
decade from the second to the seventh decades, after which the slope
flattens to 5–10% in the last decades, although up to 25% of diagnoses
can be made in individuals older than 65 years in some populations. [544]

The slope in childhood and early adulthood can be steeper (20% per
decade) and similar to that in middle age for HCM, where male sex, sub-­
tle ECG abnormalities, and particular genes are predictors of disease
expression during follow-up. [178]


Penetrance in most cardiomyopathies is incomplete, reaching
70–90% by the age of 70 years in families with cardiomyopathy. [178]

**6.11. Family screening and follow-up**
**evaluation of relatives**

All first-degree relatives of patients with cardiomyopathy should be of-­
fered clinical screening with ECG and cardiac imaging (echocardiogram

[ECHO] and/or CMR). In families in whom a disease-causing genetic
variant has been identified, cascade genetic testing should be offered
(see *Section 6.8.3* ). Individuals found not to carry the familial variant
and who do not have a clinical phenotype can usually be discharged,
with advice to seek re-assessment if they develop symptoms or when
new clinically relevant data emerge in the family. Those relatives har-­
bouring the familial genetic variant(s) should undergo regular clinical
evaluation with ECG, multimodality cardiac imaging, and additional in-­
vestigations (e.g. Holter monitoring) guided by age, family phenotype,
and genotype ( *Figure 11* ). Similarly, if a genetic cause of the disease
has not been identified, either because P/LP variants are absent in the
proband or because genetic testing has not been performed, clinical
follow-up of all first-degree relatives is recommended; in families with-­
out a known disease-causing variant, children should be offered ongoing
clinical surveillance, due to age-related penetrance, and ongoing surveil-­
lance should also be offered to adult relatives dependent on family

ESC Guidelines **3547**


With some exceptions using the current diagnostic criteria, the pene-­
trance of the disease in women has been shown to be delayed (shifted)
by 10 years compared with men. [178][,][545][–][548]

Cardiac screening in: (i) carriers of genetic P/LP variants associated
with cardiomyopathies; or (ii) in those with demonstration of a familial
disease should be offered from childhood to old age. The proposed fre-­
quency of screening is every 1–3 years with ECG and ECHO (plus add-­
itional tests where this is considered appropriate) before the age of 60
years, and then every 3–5 years thereafter.

These recommendations apply to families affected by cardiomyop-­
athy. The penetrance of similar variants identified outside this context
is likely to be much lower, and the benefits and harm of screening and
surveillance remain under evaluation. [549][–][551]


**6.11.1. Special considerations in family screening**
If the comprehensive study of the index cardiomyopathy patient (includ-­
ing negative genetic testing) and first-degree relatives from informative
families (i.e. with a large enough pedigree) leads to the conclusion that
the cardiomyopathy presents in isolation (i.e. the index patient is the
only individual affected), termination of periodic surveillance could be
considered in first-degree relatives ≥50 years of age with normal cardiac
investigations.

When the pattern of inheritance is likely to be, or is definitively, other
than autosomal dominant, consideration for periodic evaluation of re-­
latives should be individualized, e.g. (i) heterozygous carriers from clear
recessive forms of cardiomyopathy could be discharged; (ii) heterozy-­
gous carriers of X-linked disease may delay cardiac evaluation, as

significance. [a] If no additional affected relatives and no variant identified on genetic testing, consider earlier termination of clinical screening.

phenotype may express later in life; and (iii) follow-up in families with
more than one likely or definitively pathogenic variant (oligopolygenicity) should be discussed in the cardiomyopathy team.

**6.12. Psychological support in**
**cardiomyopathy patients and family**
**members**

Adjusting to a diagnosis of an inherited cardiomyopathy can pose a psy-­
chosocial challenge. This includes coming to terms with a new diagnosis,
exclusion from competitive sports, or living with the small risk of
SCD. [205] While studies show patients with inherited cardiomyopathies
adjust well following an ICD, there is an important subgroup who do
require additional support. [552][–][556] The decision to have an ICD, and liv-­
ing with the device, can also pose psychological challenges, especially in

Table 16 **Psychological considerations**


those who are young or who have experienced multiple shocks and/or
have poor baseline psychosocial functioning. [553][,][554][,][557] The SCD of a
young relative not only leads to profound grief, but one in two relatives
report post-traumatic stress or prolonged grief on average 6 years after
the death. [558] Clinical psychological support for patients and their fam-­
ilies affected by inherited cardiomyopathies is an important aspect of
the multidisciplinary team’s care approach and should be available as re-­
quired. [559] Clinicians should be aware of the potential for poor psycho-­
logical outcomes and should have a low threshold for referral.

Psychological challenges for patients and their family members are
summarized in *Table 16* . While many patients and family members
will benefit from psychosocial counselling provided by any number of
healthcare professionals, it is important to highlight that for some,
treatment by a trained professional such as a clinical psychologist is
required.





|Patient group|Psychological considerations|
|---|---|
|New diagnosis|• Stigma associated with cardiovascular disease and misconception that it only affects older people.<br>• Fear of sudden cardiac death can shake confidence and create anxiety around exercise.<br>• Fear of inheritance risk to other relatives, especially children.<br>• Confidence and self-efficacy to manage their disease.<br>• Direct experience with the disease will affect perceptions about prognosis.211|
|ICD|• Most patients will adjust well following ICD insertion, although there might be an initial decline in health-related quality of life and<br>psychological well-being, this often returns to normal.552,560,561<br>• Up to 30% will develop anxiety and/or symptoms of post-traumatic stress and need additional support.562<br>• Those who are young, who experience multiple ICD shocks, and/or have poor baseline psychological functioning are at greater risk<br>of poor psychological outcomes.553–555,561,563<br>• In young people, especially women, body image concerns can be a major consideration.554<br>• Decision-making for those recommended to have an ICD should be patient-centred and include balanced discussion of benefits<br>and risks and careful attention to questions and concerns.564|
|Exercise restrictions|• Physical inactivity is a major determinant of poor health outcomes.<br>• Can reduce health-related quality of life for those who become fearful of performing even low-intensity exercise.<br>• Athletes who are recommended to reduce their activity levels can experience a profound grief and diffci ulty adjusting to this<br>advice.565<br>• Patient-centred discussions and careful attention to concerns is critical in helping to support people make drastic lifestyle<br>changes.566–568|
|Family history of young<br>SCD|• Relatives who experience the SCD of a young relative have significant risk of poor psychological functioning, including<br>post-traumatic stress and prolonged grief.558<br>• Grief is a normal response to a loss. Prolonged grief occurs when the grieving process becomes ‘stuck’.569<br>• Those who witness the death or discover the decedents body have a greater risk of psychological diffci ulties.558<br>• Mothers of the decedent have greater anxiety.558<br>• Psychological support for family members is an important and often unmet need following a young SCD.570,571|
|Children and adolescents|• Diagnosis during childhood can raise anxiety especially among parents. Access to resources to support practical issues like<br>information for schools is important.<br>• Navigating transition from paediatric to adult care can be challenging for children and their families.<br>• Decision-making regarding genetic testing of asymptomatic children can often benefti from the inclusion of a clinical psychologist to<br>support adjustment to the result.|
|Symptomatic disease|• Those managing symptoms will likely perceive a greater impact on their health-related quality of life. Factors influencing self-efficacy<br>will impact on a patient’s ability to manage their disease, including medication adherence.572<br>• Need for major intervention such as cardiac transplantation can raise significant psychological challenges and clinical psychological<br>support is very important.573|
|Genetic testing|• Despite potential adjustment issues, most patients who undertake genetic testing do not report distress.574<br>• Genetic counselling should cover any psychosocial concerns or needs.204<br>• Additional support to patients to convey the genetic risk information to at-risk family members should be provided as necessary.575|

**6.13. The patient pathway**
The systematic, multiparametric approach to diagnosis and evaluation
of patients with suspected cardiomyopathy described in this section al-­
lows clinicians to establish the presence of a cardiomyopathy and iden-­
tify its aetiology and guides the management of symptoms and
prevention of disease-related complications. While many of the aspects
of clinical care and the accompanying recommendations are common
to all cardiomyopathy phenotypes, achieving an aetiological diagnosis
is key to delivering disease-specific management; this is discussed in de-­
tail in the subsequent sections of this guideline (see *Section 7* ).
### **7. Specific cardiomyopathy ** **phenotypes**

**7.1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**
The *2014 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and management of hypertrophic*
*cardiomyopathy* provide detailed recommendations on the assessment
and management of patients with HCM. [1] The aim in this guideline is
to provide a focused update to the 2014 document, highlighting novel
aspects and signposting the reader to the assessment and management
of HCM in adults and children. Further details to support the recom-­
[mendations are available in Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data) *Table S1* .

**7.1.1. Diagnosis**
*7.1.1.1. Diagnostic criteria*
Adults: in an adult, HCM is defined by an LV wall thickness ≥15 mm in
any myocardial segment that is not explained solely by loading condi-­
tions. Lesser degrees of wall thickening (13–14 mm) require evaluation
of other features including family history, genetic findings, and ECG
abnormalities.

Children: the diagnosis of HCM requires an LV wall thickness more than
2 standard deviations greater than the predicted mean (z-score >2). [578]


Relatives: the clinical diagnosis of HCM in adult first-degree relatives
of patients with unequivocal disease is based on the presence of LV wall
thickness ≥13 mm. In child first-degree relatives with LV wall thickness
z-scores of <2, the presence of associated morphological or ECG ab-­
normalities should raise the suspicion but are not on their own diagnos-­
tic for HCM.

*7.1.1.2. Diagnostic work-up*
The initial work-up for HCM includes personal and family history, phys-­
ical examination, electrocardiography, cardiac imaging, and first-line la-­
boratory tests, as described in *Section 6* .

*7.1.1.3. Echocardiography*
As increased ventricular wall thickness can be found at any location (in-­
cluding the right ventricle), the presence, distribution, and severity of
hypertrophy should be documented using a standardized protocol
for cross-sectional imaging from several projections. [579] *Table 17* sum-­
marizes the key imaging features to assess in patients with suspected
or confirmed HCM. Several imaging features can point to a specific diag-­
nosis ( *Table 18* and *Section 6* ). [62]

Identification of LVOTO is important in the management of
symptoms and assessment of SCD risk (see *Section 7.1.5* ).
Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography during a Valsalva
manoeuvre in the sitting and semi-supine position **—** and then on

**—**
standing if no gradient is provoked is recommended in all patients
( *Figure 12* ). [587][,][588] Exercise stress echocardiography is recom-­
mended in *symptomatic* patients if bedside manoeuvres fail to in-­
duce LVOTO ≥50 mmHg. Pharmacological provocation with
dobutamine is not advised, as it is not physiological and can be
poorly tolerated.

ticularly helpful in patients with suspected apical or lateral wall hyper-­
trophy or LV apical aneurysm. *Table 17* summarizes the main

features to be assessed.

Late gadolinium enhancement is present in 65% of patients (range
33–84%), typically in a patchy mid-wall pattern in areas of hypertrophy
and at the anterior and posterior RV insertion points. [604] Late gadolin-­
ium enhancement is unusual in non-hypertrophied segments except in
advanced stages of disease, when full-thickness LGE in association with
wall thinning is common. [604] Late gadolinium enhancement may be as-­
sociated with increased myocardial stiffness and adverse LV


remodelling and the extent of LGE is associated with a higher incidence
of RWMAs. Late gadolinium enhancement varies substantially with the
quantification method used but the 2-standard deviation technique is
the only one validated against necropsy. [605]

Although CMR rarely distinguishes the causes of HCM by their
magnetic properties alone, the distribution and severity of intersti-­
tial expansion can, in context, suggest specific diagnoses (see *Section*
*6* ). The absence of fibrosis may be helpful in differentiating HCM
from physiological adaptation in athletes, but LGE may be absent
in people with HCM, particularly young people and those with

mild disease.

*7.1.1.5. Nuclear imaging*
The major clinical contribution of nuclear imaging in HCM is the detec-­
tion of TTR-related cardiac amyloidosis (see *Section 7.7* ).
Recommendations on the utility of bone scintigraphy and cardiac CT

are described in *Section 6.7.4* .


**7.1.2. Genetic testing and family screening**

In about half of cases, HCM is inherited as a Mendelian genetic trait. In
such cases, the inheritance is primarily autosomal dominant, i.e. with a
50% risk of transmission to offspring. [608] Apparently sporadic cases can
have a monogenic cause, either because of incomplete penetrance of a

**3552** ESC Guidelines


variant inherited from a parent or due to *de novo* variants that were not
carried by the parents or, less commonly, due to autosomal recessive
inheritance. In those who undergo genetic testing, ∼40–60% will have
a single variant identified as the cause of their disease, although this is
influenced by the cohort studied. [124] The likelihood of finding a causal
variant is highest in young patients with familial disease and lowest
in older patients and individuals with non-classical features.
Phenotype-based scores to predict genetic yield in HCM have been de-­
veloped and may be used to prioritize genetic testing where resources
are limited. [609][,][610] Genes with definitive evidence for gene–disease asso-­
ciation with HCM are summarized in *Table 10* . An important subgroup
characterized by no identifiable monogenic variant, no family history of
disease and often being older, more likely to be male and with a history
of hypertension, and less risk of major cardiovascular events is likely to
be underlied by complex aetiology. [238][,][611][,][612]

Less than 5% of adult patients, but up to 25% of children, with HCM,
will have a causative variant in a gene that is known to mimic the HCM
phenotype. Such genocopies can have clinically important differences
such as altered inheritance risks, and management and therapy options.
The aetiology of HCM in childhood is more heterogeneous than that
seen in adult populations, and includes inborn errors of metabolism,
malformation syndromes, and neuromuscular disorders. [613][–][615] Most
cases of HCM in childhood, however, are caused by variants in the car-­
diac sarcomere protein genes, inherited as autosomal dominant
traits. [616][,][617] The relative prevalence of different HCM aetiologies varies
according to age: HCM related to inborn errors of metabolism and mal-­
formation syndromes is most commonly diagnosed in the first 2 years
of life, whereas HCM due to neuromuscular disorders (e.g. Friedreich
ataxia) most commonly presents in adolescence. [613][–][615] Outside of


infancy, sarcomere protein gene variants account for 55–75% of cases
of childhood-onset HCM, [616][–][619] and even in infancy, sarcomeric dis-­
ease is present in up to 40% of cases. [616][,][620] Although rarer, inborn er-­
rors of metabolism and malformation syndromes can also present for
the first time in older children and adolescents (see *Section 7.6* ). [614]

A thorough and comprehensive diagnostic work-up is essential in the
diagnosis of childhood-onset HCM in order to confirm the diagnosis,
identify the underlying aetiology, and guide treatment (see *Section 6* ).

Recommendations for clinical screening, genetic counselling, and
testing are described in *Sections 6.8.3* and *6.11*, respectively.

**7.1.3. Assessment of symptoms**

Most people with HCM are asymptomatic and have a normal lifespan,
but some develop symptoms, often many years after the appearance of
ECG or echocardiographic evidence of LVH. Assessment of symptoms
in patients with cardiomyopathies is described in *Section 6.4* .
Assessment of LVOTO, as outlined in *Figure 12*, should be part of
the routine evaluation of all symptomatic patients.

**7.1.4. Management of symptoms and complications**
In the absence of many randomized trials, [621][–][623] pharmacological ther-­
apy is mostly administered on an empirical basis to improve functional
capacity and reduce symptoms. In symptomatic patients with LVOTO,
the aim is to improve symptoms by using drugs, surgery, or alcohol sep-­
tal ablation. Therapy in symptomatic patients without LVOTO focuses
on management of arrhythmia, reduction of LV filling pressures, and
treatment of angina. Patients with progressive LV systolic or diastolic
dysfunction refractory to medical therapy may be candidates for car-­
diac transplantation ( *Figure 13* ).

ESC Guidelines **3553**


*7.1.4.1. Management of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction*
By convention, LVOTO is defined as a peak instantaneous Doppler LV
outflow tract gradient of ≥30 mmHg, but the threshold for invasive
treatment is usually considered to be ≥50 mmHg (the threshold at
which theoretical models examining the relationship between the gra-­
dient and stroke volume predict that this becomes haemodynamically
significant). [587][,][624][,][625] Most patients with a maximum resting or pro-­
voked LV outflow tract gradient <50 mmHg should be managed in ac-­
cordance with the recommendations for non-obstructive HCM but, in
a very small number of selected cases with LV outflow tract gradients
between 30 and 50 mmHg and no other obvious cause of symptoms,
invasive gradient reduction may be considered, acknowledging that
data covering this group are lacking. Most asymptomatic patients
with LVOTO do not require treatment but, in a very small number
of selected cases, pharmacological treatment to reduced LV pressures
may be considered. [626][,][627]

*7.1.4.1.1. General measures.* All patients with LVOTO should avoid
dehydration and excess alcohol consumption, and weight loss should
be encouraged. Arterial and venous dilators, including nitrates and
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, can exacerbate LVOTO and
should be avoided if possible (see *Section 12.2* ). [626] New-onset or
poorly controlled AF can exacerbate symptoms caused by LVOTO
and should be managed by prompt restoration of sinus rhythm or ven-­
tricular rate control. [628]

*7.1.4.1.2. Drug therapy.* *Figure 14* describes the management of
LVOTO in patients with HCM. By consensus, patients with symptom-­
atic LVOTO have been treated initially with non-vasodilating betablockers titrated to the maximum tolerated dose, but there are very
few studies comparing individual beta-blockers. A recent small, rando-­
mized placebo-controlled trial showed reduction of resting and exer-­
tional LVOTO, and improvement in symptoms and QoL with
metoprolol therapy. [631]

If beta-blockers alone are ineffective, disopyramide, titrated up to a
maximum tolerated dose (usually 400–600 mg/day), may be
added. [632][–][634] This class IA AAD can abolish basal LV outflow pressure
gradients and improve exercise tolerance and functional capacity with a
low risk of proarrhythmic effects and without an increased risk of
SCD. [632][,][633] Dose-limiting anticholinergic side effects include dry eyes
and mouth, urinary hesitancy or retention, and constipation. [632][,][633][,][635]

The QTc interval should be monitored during dose up-titration and


the dose reduced if it exceeds 500 ms. Disopyramide should be avoided
in patients with glaucoma, in men with prostatism, and in patients taking
other drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as amiodarone and so-­
talol. Disopyramide may be used in combination with verapamil. [633]

Verapamil (starting dose 40 mg three times daily to maximum
480 mg daily) can be used when beta-blockers are contraindicated or
ineffective but, based on limited data, should be used cautiously in pa-­
tients with severe obstruction (≥100 mmHg) or elevated pulmonary
artery systolic pressures, as it may provoke pulmonary oedema. [636]

Short-term oral administration may increase exercise capacity, improve
symptoms, and normalize or improve LV diastolic filling without altering
systolic function. [637][–][640] Similar findings have been demonstrated for dil-­
tiazem (starting dose 60 mg three times daily to maximum 360 mg dai-­
ly), [641] and it should be considered in patients who are intolerant or
have contraindications to beta-blockers and verapamil.

Low-dose loop or thiazide diuretics may be used cautiously to im-­
prove dyspnoea associated with LVOTO, but it is important to avoid
hypovolaemia.

*Cardiac myosin ATPase inhibitors.* Mavacamten is a first-in-class cardiac
myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) inhibitor that acts by redu-­
cing actin–myosin cross-bridge formation, thereby reducing contractil-­
ity and improving myocardial energetics. In the recently published
Clinical Study to Evaluate Mavacamten in Adults with Symptomatic
Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (EXPLORER-HCM) trial,
mavacamten reduced the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient
and improved exercise capacity compared with placebo in patients with
HCM and symptomatic LVOTO (NYHA II–III and EF >55%); 27% of
patients on mavacamten had an LVOT gradient reduction to
<30 mmHg and improved to NYHA class I. [622] The drug was well tol-­
erated and has a good safety profile; only a small subset of patients de-­
veloped transient LV systolic dysfunction, which resolved after
temporary discontinuation of the drug. A second study (A Study to
Evaluate Mavacamten in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive HCM
Who Are Eligible for Septal Reduction Therapy [VALOR-HCM]) in
adult patients with obstructive HCM referred for septal reduction ther-­
apy (SRT) due to intractable symptoms showed that mavacamten sig-­
nificantly reduced the proportion of patients meeting criteria for SRT
at 16 and 32 weeks. [642][,][643] Small CMR and ECHO substudies suggest
that mavacamten may also lead to positive myocardial remodelling,
with reduction in myocardial mass, LV wall thickness, and left atrial vol-­
ume. [644][–][646] Aficamten, a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, was
also recently shown in a Phase II randomized placebo-controlled study
(Randomized Evaluation of Dosing With CK-3773274 in Obstructive
Outflow Disease in HCM [REDWOOD-HCM]) to significantly reduce
LVOT gradients and NT-proBNP levels in adult patients with symp-­
tomatic obstructive HCM. [647]

In the absence of a direct head-to-head comparison, the Task Force
was unable to recommend the use of cardiac myosin ATPase inhibitors
as first-line medical therapy, but did consider the evidence sufficiently
robust to support the recommendation that their use as second-line
therapy should be considered when optimal medical therapy with betablockers, calcium antagonists, and/or disopyramide is ineffective or
poorly tolerated. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, cardiac
myosin ATPase inhibitors should not be used with disopyramide, but
may be coadministered with beta-blockers or calcium antagonists.
Up-titration of medication to a maximum dose of 15 mg should be
monitored in accordance with licensed recommendations using echo-­
cardiography. In patients with contraindications or known sensitivity
to beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and disopyramide, cardiac my-­
osin ATPase inhibitors may be considered as monotherapy.

ESC Guidelines **3555**


*7.1.4.1.3. Invasive treatment of left ventricular outflow tract (septal*
*reduction therapy).* There are no data to support the use of invasive
procedures to reduce LVOTO in asymptomatic patients, regardless
of its severity. However, some retrospective data suggest that indivi-­
duals with high LVOT gradients, even if minimally symptomatic, have
a higher mortality than those without markedly elevated gradients. [651]

Delay in SRT may have an impact on long-term outcomes, particularly
when >5 years from first detection of gradient, even when successful
relief of symptoms and gradient is achieved. Earlier interventions may
be associated with lower complication rates and better prognosis. [652]

Invasive treatment (SRT) to reduce LVOTO should be considered in
patients with a LVOTO gradient ≥50 mmHg, severe symptoms


(NYHA functional class III–IV), and/or exertional or unexplained recur-­
rent syncope in spite of maximally tolerated drug therapy. Invasive ther-­
apy may also be considered in patients with mild symptoms (NYHA
class II) refractory to medical therapy who have a resting or maximum
provoked gradient of ≥50 mmHg (exercise or Valsalva) and
moderate-to-severe systolic anterior motion-related mitral regurgita-­
tion, AF, or moderate-to-severe left atrial dilatation in expert centres
with demonstrable low procedural complication rates. [653]

*Surgery.* The most commonly performed surgical procedure to treat
LVOTO is ventricular septal myectomy, in which a rectangular trough
that extends distally to beyond the point of the mitral leaflet–septal
contact is created in the basal septum below the aortic valve. [654] This










Figure 15 Pre-assessment checklist for patients being considered for invasive septal reduction therapies. AF, atrial fibrillation; MV, mitral valve; RVOTO,
right ventricular outflow tract obstruction; SAM, systolic anterior motion.

**3556** ESC Guidelines


abolishes or substantially reduces LV outflow tract gradients in over
90% of cases, reduces systolic anterior motion-related mitral regurgita-­
tion, and improves exercise capacity and symptoms. Long-term symp-­
tomatic benefit is achieved in >80% of patients with a long-term survival
comparable to that of the general population. [655][–][665] Pre-operative de-­
terminants of a good long-term outcome are age <50 years, left atrial
size <46 mm, absence of AF, and male sex. [663]

The main surgical complications are AV nodal block, left bundle
branch block (LBBB), ventricular septal defect, and aortic regurgitation,
but these are uncommon (except LBBB) in experienced centres using
intra-operative transoesophageal echocardiography guidance. [662][,][666][,][667]

When there is coexisting mid-cavity obstruction, the standard myect-­
omy can be extended distally into the mid-ventricle around the base
of the papillary muscles; however, data on the efficacy and long-term
outcomes of this approach are limited. [668]

In patients with intrinsic/primary mitral valve disease or marked mi-­
tral leaflet elongation and/or moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation,
septal myectomy can be combined with mitral valve repair or replace-­
ment. [669][–][675] In patients with AF, concomitant ablation using the Cox–
Maze procedure can also be performed. [676] In infants and very young
children, the modified Konno procedure may be an alternative to
myectomy when the aortic annulus is too small. [677]

*Alcohol septal ablation (ASA).* In experienced centres, selective injection
of alcohol into a septal perforator artery to create a localized septal scar
has outcomes similar to surgery in terms of gradient reduction, symptom
improvement, and exercise capacity, including in younger adults. [678][–][685] In
many centres, ASA has become the primary SRT modality. The main nonfatal complication is AV block in 7–20% of patients, and the procedural
mortality is lower than isolated myectomy. [679][–][683][,][686][,][687]

Due to the variability of the septal blood supply, myocardial contrast
echocardiography is essential prior to alcohol injection. Injection of
large volumes of alcohol in multiple septal branches—with the aim of
gradient reduction—in the catheter laboratory is generally not recom-­
mended, as it can be associated with a high risk of complications and
arrhythmic events. [688]

Alternative methods have been reported in small numbers of pa-­
tients, including non-ASA techniques (coils, [689][,][690] polyvinyl alcohol
foam particles, [691] cyanoacrylate [692] ) and direct endocavitary and intra-­
muscular ablation (radiofrequency, cryotherapy). [693][,][694] These alterna-­
tive methods have not been directly compared with other septal
reduction therapies and long-term outcome/safety data are not avail-­
able. Alcohol septal ablation and alternative methods should not be
used in children with HCM outside experimental settings, due to a
lack of medium- to long-term safety and efficacy data.

*Surgery vs. alcohol septal ablation.* Because of specific anatomic fea-­
tures of the LVOT and the mitral valve, some patients with HCM will
be more suitable candidates for septal myectomy than ASA.
Experienced multidisciplinary teams should assess all patients before
intervention, as morbidity and mortality are highly dependent on the
available level of expertise (see *Section 9* ). [687][,][695][,][696] A summary of the
key points in pre-operative assessment is shown in *Figure 15.*

There are no randomized trials comparing surgery and ASA, but sev-­
eral meta-analyses have shown that both procedures improve functional
status with a similar procedural mortality. [697][–][703] Alcohol septal ablation
is associated with a higher risk of AV block, requiring permanent pace-­
maker implantation, and larger residual LV outflow tract gradients. [697][– ]

702 The risk of AV block following surgery and ASA is highest in patients
with pre-existing conduction disease, and prophylactic permanent pacing
before intervention has been advocated, [704] although recent data suggest


that the long-term outcome of patients after ASA with implanted per-­
manent pacemaker is similar to those without pacemaker. [705] Repeat
ASA or myectomy procedure is reported in 7–20% of patients after
ASA, which is higher than reported following surgical myectomy. [702]

Septal ablation may be less effective in patients with very severe hyper-­
trophy (≥30 mm), but systematic data are limited. [706] In general, the
risk of ventricular septal defect following septal myectomy is very small
and could be higher in patients with mild hypertrophy (≤16 mm) at
the point of the mitral leaflet–septal contact. This risk is exceedingly
rare with ASA, but alternatives such as dual-chamber pacing or mitral
valve repair/replacement may also be considered in such cases. [707]

*Dual-chamber pacing.* Three small, randomized, placebo-controlled
studies of dual-chamber pacing and several long-term observational
studies have reported reductions in LV outflow tract gradients and vari-­
able improvement in symptoms and QoL, including one paediatric
study. [719][–][724] A Cochrane review concluded that the data on the ben-­
efits of pacing are based on physiological measures and lack information
on clinically relevant endpoints. [725]

obstruction can be relieved by transaortic myectomy, a transapical ap-­
proach, or combined transaortic and transapical incisions, with good
short-term outcomes but uncertain long-term survival. [731][,][732]

Left ventricular apical aneurysms by themselves rarely need treatment.
A few patients develop monomorphic ventricular tachycardia related to
adjacent apical scarring, which may be amenable to mapping and ablation
(see *Section 7.1.5* ). [730][,][733] Rarely, thrombi are present within the aneur-­
ysm and should be treated with long-term oral anticoagulation. [734][,][735]

Anticoagulation may also be considered in patients with HCM and apical
aneurysms in the absence of documented thrombi. [736][,][737]

in patients without LVOTO should follow the recommendations of
the *2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and*
*chronic heart failure*, summarized in *Section 6.10.2* . The aim of drug
therapy is to reduce LV diastolic pressures and improve LV filling by
slowing the heart rate with beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem
(ideally monitored by ambulatory ECG recording), and cautious use
of loop diuretics. Beta-blockers or calcium antagonists should be con-­
sidered in patients with exertional or prolonged episodes of anginalike pain even in the absence of resting or provocable LVOTO or ob-­
structive CAD. In the absence of LVOTO, cautious use of oral nitrates

may be considered. Ranolazine may also be considered to improve
symptoms in patients with angina-like chest pain and no evidence
for LVOTO. [738][,][739]

*Left ventricular mid-cavity obstruction and apical aneurysms* . Left ventricu-­

Patients with mid-cavity obstruction tend to be very symptomatic and,
in a number of studies, have shown an increased risk of progressive heart
failure and SCD. [727][–][729] Approximately 25% of patients also have an LV
apical aneurysm (see *Section 7.1.5* ). [580][,][727][,][728][,][730] Patients with LV midcavity obstruction should be treated with high-dose beta-blockers, ver-­

*7.1.4.2.2. Cardiac resynchronization therapy.* Regional heterogen-­
eity of LV contraction and relaxation can be seen in patients with
HCM, and LV dyssynchrony may be a marker of poor prognosis. [745]

Data on the impact of CRT on symptoms, LV function, and prognosis
in patients with non-obstructive HCM remain limited, but new evi-­
dence has emerged since the *2014 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and man-­*
*agement of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy* . [746][,][747] There is one small study
using a blinded crossover design of biventricular and sham pacing and a
pre-specified analysis stratified by changes in LV end-diastolic volume
(LVEDV) with exercise at baseline. [748] Biventricular pacing was asso-­
ciated with significant increases in LVEDV and stroke volume in patients

**3558** ESC Guidelines


who had a reduction in exercise LVEDV pre-pacing (consistent with the
relief of diastolic ventricular interaction). This translated into improve-­
ments in peak maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) (1.4 mL/kg/min)
and QoL scores. [748] Together, they suggest that symptomatic responses
to CRT may occur in individual patients, but that these are not asso-­
ciated with consistent changes in LVEF or evidence for a reduction in
progression to end-stage heart failure.

The *2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchroniza-­*
*tion therapy* recommend that standard criteria for CRT are used in pa-­
tients with HCM. [724] The Task Force considered these of limited utility
in HCM, as the unique pathology of this disease means that patients
with contractile impairment rarely have an LVEF ≤35%. While ac-­
knowledging this as an area of unmet research need, the Task Force
suggests a more pragmatic approach in which CRT might be consid-­
ered in individual symptomatic patients with LV impairment (LVEF
<50%) that meet current ESC ECG criteria (LBBB, QRS 130–
149 ms). Cardiac resynchronization therapy might also be considered
in patients with HCM and impaired systolic function who require per-­
manent ventricular pacing. [746] In keeping with the *2021 ESC Guidelines*
*on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy*, the Task Force


did not include these as specific recommendations, given the limited
evidence base.

**7.1.5. Sudden cardiac death prevention in**
**hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**

Most contemporary series of adult patients with HCM report an annual
incidence for cardiovascular death of 1–2%, with SCD, heart failure, and
thrombo-embolism being the main causes of death. [749] The most com-­
monly recorded fatal arrhythmic event is spontaneous ventricular fibril-­
lation (VF), but asystole, AV block, and pulseless electrical activity are
described. [532][,][750][–][754] In children with HCM, although initial studies, usu-­
ally from small, highly selected cohorts, reported SCD rates of up to
10% per year, [755][–][757] more recent, larger, population-based studies
have shown SCD rates in the region of 1.2–1.5% per year. [81][,][535][,][758]

While much lower than previously thought, this is still >50% higher
than reported in adult HCM populations. Sudden cardiac death appears
to be very rare below the age of 6 years. [81][,][759]

Estimation of SCD risk is an integral part of clinical management. Clinical

features that are associated with an increased SCD risk and that have been

used in previous guidelines to estimate risk are shown in *Table 19* .


Table 19 **Major clinical features associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death**




|Risk factor|Comment|
|---|---|
|Age|• The effect of age on SCD has been examined in a number of studies86,525,584,760–764 and two have shown a significant<br>association, with an increased risk of SCD in younger patients.525,584<br>• Some risk factors appear to be more important in younger patients, most notably NSVT,765 severe LVH,766 and<br>unexplained syncope.584<br>• Sudden cardiac death is very rare below the age of 6 years,535,767 and there are some data to suggest a peak of SCD in<br>childhood HCM between 9 and 15 years;757 however, the association between age at diagnosis and SCD risk in<br>childhood HCM remains unclear.|
|NSVT|• NSVT (defined as ≥3 consecutive ventricular beats at ≥120 b.p.m. lasting <30 s) occurs in 20–30% of patients during<br>ambulatory ECG monitoring and is an independent predictor of SCD.81,525,535,590,764,765,768–773<br>• There is no evidence that the frequency, duration, or rate of NSVT inful ences the risk of SCD.765,774<br>• NSVT occurring during or immediately following exercise is very rare, but may be associated with a high risk of SCD.768|
|Maximum LV wall thickness|• The severity and extent of LVH measured by TTE are associated with the risk of SCD.81,535,592,593,763,765,770–772,775–780<br>• Several studies have shown the greatest risk of SCD in patients with a maximum wall thickness of ≥30 mm; however,<br>there are few data in patients with extreme hypertrophy (≥35 mm).525,592,763,765,769,781–784|
|Family history of sudden cardiac death<br>at a young age|• While definitions vary,525,592,762,782 a family history of SCD is usually considered clinically signifci ant when one or<br>more first-degree relatives have died suddenly aged <40 years with or without a diagnosis of HCM, or when SCD has<br>occurred in a first-degree relative at any age with an established diagnosis of HCM.<br>• Family history of SCD does not appear to be an independent risk factor for SCD in childhood HCM.81,535 This may be<br>due to a higher prevalence of de novo variants in childhood HCM, the inclusion of non-sarcomeric disease, and/or<br>under-reporting of family history in paediatric cohorts.|
|Syncope|• Syncope is common in patients with HCM but is challenging to assess, as it has multiple causes.785<br>• Non-neurocardiogenic syncope for which there is no explanation after investigation is associated with an increased<br>risk of SCD.81,525,535,584,590,755,761,768,769,781,786–788<br>• Episodes within 6 months of evaluation may be more predictive of SCD.584|
|Left atrial diameter|• Several studies have reported a positive association between LA size and SCD.81,525,535,584,772,789 There are no data<br>on the association between SCD and LA area or volume. Measurement of LA size is also important in assessing the<br>risk of AF (see Section 6.10.3).|
|LV outflow tract obstruction|• A number of studies have reported a signifci ant association between LVOTO and SCD risk.86,525,590,762,768,790 Several<br>unanswered questions remain, including the prognostic importance of provocable LVOTO and the impact of<br>treatment (medical or invasive) on SCD.<br>• In childhood HCM, there are confilcting data on the association between LVOTO and SCD risk.81,535,772,777|

ESC Guidelines **3559**


*7.1.5.1. Left ventricular apical aneurysms*
Left ventricular apical aneurysms are defined as a discrete thin-walled
dyskinetic or akinetic segment of the most distal portion of the left
ventricle and are often associated with a mid-cavity gradient. Their
prevalence in unselected patients is uncertain but they were re-­
ported in 3% of individuals in the prospective Hypertrophic
Cardiomyopathy Registry (HCMR). [124] The first descriptions of LV
apical aneurysms in HCM suggested an association with sustained

**—**
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) [730] a relatively rare
occurrence in HCM **—** and a number of studies have suggested that
they are a useful marker of SCD risk. [580][,][728][,][736][,][737][,][791][,][792] Based on
these data, LV aneurysms were included in the recent 2020
American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology
(AHA/ACC) HCM guideline as a major independent SCD risk factor
and were considered a reasonable sole indication for an ICD. [793] In a

review for this guideline, the data from two published studies and a
meta-analysis were evaluated (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data)
*[Table S2](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data)* ). All these studies were retrospective and the absolute num-­
ber of events is too small to assess the independent predictive value
of apical aneurysms. In two small series that described a selected sub-­
group of HCM patients with mid-ventricular obstruction, there was
no increase in incidence of SCD events. In the only series that pro-­
vides a detailed analysis of SCD events, the majority were appropri-­
ate ICD interventions for monomorphic VT, suggesting significant
inclusion bias. [737] Finally, a large proportion of individuals with events
had other important risk markers including prior sustained ventricu-­
lar arrhythmia. Based on the current data, the Task Force recom-­
mends that individualized ICD decisions should be based using
well-established risk factors and not solely on the presence of an
LV apical aneurysm.

*7.1.5.2. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction*

A small number of retrospective studies and two larger registries
have examined the relation between prognosis in patients with
HCM and LV systolic dysfunction (most frequently defined by a
[LVEF <50%) (see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data) *Table S3* ). All studies
consistently show an increased rate of SCD events in patients with
left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) ranging from 7 to 20%
compared with that of patients with normal LV systolic function.
However, the independent and additional value of LVSD compared
with current risk stratification tools has not been investigated.
There is only one multivariable model that investigates the independ-­
ent relation of LVSD to the risk of SCD events but the covariables
examined were limited (age, sex, and follow-up time). [315] As with
other recently proposed risk markers in HCM, the Task Force main-­
tains its recommendation to first estimate SCD risk using the
HCM-SCD Risk and HCM Risk-Kids tools, and then to use the pres-­
ence of an LVEF <50% in shared decision-making about prophylactic
ICD implantation, with full disclosure of the lack of robust data on its
impact on prognosis.

*7.1.5.3. Late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic*
*resonance imaging*

In the *2014 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and management of hypertrophic*
*cardiomyopathy*, the extent of LGE on CMR was considered helpful in
predicting cardiovascular mortality, but data at that time were felt insuf-­
ficient to support the use of LGE in prediction of SCD risk. Since then,


more studies have been published (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data)
*[Table S1](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data)* ). In aggregate, the data show that LGE is common and, that
when extensive (expressed as a percentage of LV mass), is associated
with an increase in SCD risk and other events, particularly in the pres-­
ence of other markers of disease severity including LV systolic impair-­
ment. A meta-analysis of nearly 3000 patients from several studies
suggests that the presence of LGE is associated with a 2.32-fold in-­
creased risk of SCD/aborted SCD/appropriate ICD discharge, and a
2.1-fold increase in all-cause mortality. [794] It has been suggested that
the addition of LGE to the current AHA/ACC sudden death algorithm
or the HCM-SCD risk model improves stratification of patients who
are otherwise considered low or intermediate risk. [793]

As in 2014, a number of uncertainties persist. These include the in-­
evitable confounders in the retrospective studies that bias towards
high-risk patients or patients referred specifically for septal myectomy.
There also remains some debate about the methods used to quantify
LGE with the 2-standard deviation technique; the only one that is vali-­
dated against necropsy. [605] Retrospective CMR series also report rela-­
tively high event rates suggesting that they are not representative of the
broad spectrum of disease. In HCMR, a prospective CMR study of 2755
patients, LGE was present in 50% of patients based on visual criteria and
in 60% based on >6 SCD signal criteria, but only 2% of patients had LGE
>15% of LV mass. [124] In the most recent report from the registry, there
have been 24 deaths from any cause after a mean follow-up of 33.5 ±
12.4 months (median: 36 months and range 1–64 months); the relation
with LGE is not reported. [795] There are very limited data on the role of
CMR over and above validated risk algorithms in SCD risk prediction in
children with HCM. [796][,][797]

On balance, the Task Force maintains the recommendation to first
estimate SCD risk using the HCM-SCD Risk calculators. For patients
who are in the low to intermediate risk category, the presence of ex-­
tensive LGE (≥15%) may be used in shared decision-making with pa-­
tients about prophylactic ICD implantation, acknowledging the lack of
robust data on the impact of scar quantification on the personalized
risk estimates generated by the HCM-SCD Risk calculators.

*7.1.5.4. Abnormal exercise blood pressure response*

Approximately one-third of adult patients with HCM have an abnormal
systolic blood pressure response to exercise characterized by progres-­
sive hypotension or a failure to augment the systolic blood pressure
that is caused by an inappropriate drop in systemic vascular resistance
and a low cardiac output reserve. [798][,][799] Various definitions for abnor-­
mal blood pressure response in patients with HCM have been re-­
ported; [590][,][765][,][768][,][782] for the purposes of this guideline, an abnormal
blood pressure response is defined as a failure to increase systolic pres-­
sure by at least 20 mmHg from rest to peak exercise or a fall of
>20 mmHg from peak pressure. [590][,][765][,][768][,][782][,][800]

Abnormal exercise blood pressure response may be associated
with a higher risk of SCD in adult patients aged ≤40 years, but it
has a low positive predictive accuracy and its prognostic significance
in patients >40 years of age is unknown, and recent data have sug-­
gested that, although it may be associated with increased overall mor-­
tality largely related to heart failure, it is not consistently associated
with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia or SCD. [800][,][801]

There is no evidence to suggest that abnormal blood pressure re-­
sponse to exercise is associated with a higher risk of SCD in children
with HCM. [802] The Task Force, therefore, does not recommend the

use of abnormal blood pressure response to exercise as an indication

**3560** ESC Guidelines


for primary prevention ICD implantation in patients with a low or
intermediate risk category.

*7.1.5.5. Sarcomeric variants*

A small number of studies have explored the prognostic value of sarco-­
meric variants in HCM. Despite initial attempts to classify variants as
‘malignant’ or ‘benign’, [803][–][807] no studies have shown an independent
role for specific sarcomeric variants in SCD risk prediction. Variants ini-­
tially classified as ‘malignant’ or ‘benign’ can have very different pheno-­
typic expression, even in members of the same family, [808][–][810] and, as
variants are often found in individual families, evaluation of their prog-­
nostic implications is problematic. Similarly, while the presence of mul-­
tiple sarcomeric variants in an individual has been suggested to be
associated with a worse prognosis, [608][,][811][–][813] other cohorts have not
consistently reported this association. [807][,][814][–][816] Recent studies have
evaluated the potential prognostic role of the presence of any sarco-­
meric variant. The largest of these, comprising 2763 patients, showed
a statistically significant impact on overall prognosis in those with vs.
without a sarcomeric variant, but did not assess its association specific-­
ally with SCD. [238] A smaller study of 512 probands and 114 relatives, of
whom 327 had a disease-causing sarcomeric variant, suggested that the
presence of a pathogenic variant was independently associated with allcause, cardiovascular, and heart failure mortality as well as SCD/
aborted SCD (HR 2.88; 95% CI, 1.23–6.71). [817] Patients with a sarco-­
meric variant were younger and were more likely to have NSVT, syn-­
cope, and LVOTO and the association with SCD lost statistical
significance (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 0.99–6.01; *P* = 0.052) after adjusting
for ≥2 major clinical risk factors. The role of sarcomeric variants as a
predictor of SCD independent of SCD risk-prediction models (e.g.
HCM Risk-SCD and HCM Risk-Kids) remains to be demonstrated.
Based on the available data, the Task Force does not recommend the

use of the presence of sarcomeric variant(s) to guide decisions around
ICD implantation for primary prevention in individuals with a low or

intermediate SCD risk score.

*7.1.5.6. Prevention of sudden cardiac death*

There are no randomized, controlled data to support the use of AADs
for the prevention of SCD in HCM. Amiodarone was associated with a
lower incidence of SCD in one small observational study of patients
with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on Holter monitor-­
ing, but observational data suggest that amiodarone often fails to pre-­
vent SCD. [818][,][819] Disopyramide does not appear to have a significant
impact on the risk of SCD. [632] However, beta-blockers and/or amiodar-­
one are recommended in patients with an ICD who continue to have
symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, paroxysmal AF, or recurrent
shocks despite optimal treatment and device re-programming. [820]

There are no randomized trials or statistically validated prospective
prediction models that can be used to guide ICD implantation in pa-­
tients with HCM. Recommendations are instead based on observation-­
al, retrospective cohort studies that have determined the relationship
between clinical characteristics and prognosis. The *2014 ESC*
*Guidelines on diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy*
[recommended a risk-prediction model—HCM Risk-SCD (https://](https://qxmd.com/calculate/calculator_303/hcm-risk-scd)
[qxmd.com/calculate/calculator_303/hcm-risk-scd)—that provides indi-­](https://qxmd.com/calculate/calculator_303/hcm-risk-scd)
vidualized, quantitative risk estimates using an enhanced phenotypic ap-­
proach. [525] This approach has since been validated in independent


cohorts and a meta-analysis of available published data, relevant to
the *2014 ESC Guidelines on diagnosis and management of hypertrophic*
*cardiomyopathy* performance, for SCD prevention has shown that
pooled estimates are concordant with the observed SCD risk in pa-­
tients designated as high or low risk. [821][–][824] In children, risk stratification
for SCD has traditionally been based on risk factors extrapolated from
adults with HCM, but this approach does not identify the children most
at risk of SCD. In 2019, the first validated paediatric-specific risk model
[for SCD was developed (HCM Risk-Kids; https://hcmriskkids.org), using](https://hcmriskkids.org)
a similar approach to HCM Risk-SCD, [81][,][825] and has since been inde-­
pendently externally validated. [535][,][797][,][826] A similar paediatric riskprediction model (PRIMaCY Childhood HCM Sudden Cardiac Death
Risk Prediction tool) has also been developed, using similar clinical para-­
[meters and with similar reported accuracy to HCM Risk-Kids (https://](https://primacy.shinyapps.io/calculator/)
[primacy.shinyapps.io/calculator/).](https://primacy.shinyapps.io/calculator/) [535]

In this update, the Task Force maintains the principle of risk esti-­
mation using the validated HCM Risk-SCD tool as the first step in
sudden death prevention in patients aged 16 years or more, and re-­
commends the use of a validated risk score (e.g. HCM Risk-Kids tool)
for children and adolescents <16 years. This is in contrast to the
*2020 AHA/ACC Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of patients*
*with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy*, [793] in which the tool is considered
an aid to a shared decision-making process for ICD placement in pa-­
tients with clinical risk markers. This approach by the AHA/ACC, in
part, reflected concerns that reliance on a risk tool does not account
for individual patient perception and acceptance of pre-determined
thresholds for medical intervention, as well as the omission of clinical

risk markers such as LV systolic impairment from the HCM Risk-SCD

model.

The Task Force acknowledges the challenges associated with defining
universal thresholds for acceptable risk, but feels that reliance on an un-­
quantified estimate of risk does nothing to resolve this dilemma.
Instead, the Task Force recommends more overt shared decisionmaking based on real-world data as well as individual preferences, be-­
liefs, circumstances, and values. Gaps in evidence are acknowledged
and should be shared with patients. Similarly, competing risks related
to the disease (heart failure, stroke) and to age and comorbidity, as
well as device-related complications, should be discussed. [726][,][827][,][828]

Critically, the Task Force calls for development of enhanced patient de-­
cision aids tailored specifically to receivers of care as well as more trad-­
itional decision-support tools for healthcare practitioners.

*Figure 16* summarizes the recommendations for primary preven-­
tion ICD implantation in HCM in each risk category. These take
into account not only the absolute statistical risk, but also the age
and general health of the patient, socioeconomic factors, and the psy-­
chological impact of therapy. The recommendations are meant to be
sufficiently flexible to account for scenarios that are not encompassed
by the HCM Risk-SCD or HCM Risk-Kids models. These models
should not be used in elite athletes or in individuals with metabolic/in-­
filtrative diseases (e.g. Anderson–Fabry disease) and syndromes (e.g.
Noonan syndrome). The models do not use exercise-induced LV out-­
flow tract gradients and have not been validated before and after
myectomy. The HCM Risk-SCD model has been validated in one
study of adult patients following ASA, [829] and a recent study has
suggested that severe LVH and residual LVOTO are associated with
an increased risk of SCD following ASA, with a modest C-statistic
of 0.68. [830]

**7.2. Dilated cardiomyopathy**
**7.2.1. Diagnosis**
*7.2.1.1. Index case*

Dilated cardiomyopathy is defined by the presence of LV dilatation and
systolic dysfunction unexplained solely by abnormal loading conditions
or CAD. Left ventricular dilatation is defined by LV end-diastolic dimen-­
sions or volumes >2 z-scores above population mean values corrected
for body size, sex, and/or age. For adults this represents an LV enddiastolic diameter >58 mm in males and >52 in females and an
LVEDV index of ≥75 mL/m [2 ] in males and ≥62 mL/m [2 ] in females by
ECHO. [9][,][845][,][846] Left ventricular global systolic dysfunction is defined
by LVEF <50%. [9]

*7.2.1.2. Relatives*

Clinical testing in relatives often reveals mild non-diagnostic abnormal-­
ities that overlap with normal variation or mimic changes seen in other
more common diseases such as hypertension and obesity. In this con-­
text, the presence of isolated LV dilatation with preserved systolic func-­
tion or in the presence of a familial causative variant is sufficient for a
diagnosis of DCM in a relative. Additional electrocardiographic or im-­
aging abnormalities in the context of a family history of DCM are sug-­
gestive of disease and warrant close follow-up. [9][,][75][,][817] In the absence of
conclusive genetic information in a family, DCM is considered familial if:
(i) one or more first- or second-degree relatives have DCM; or (ii)
when an otherwise unexplained SCD has occurred in a first-degree
relative at any age with an established diagnosis of DCM.

*7.2.1.3. Diagnostic work-up*

The key elements of the diagnostic work-up for all patients with DCM
are described in *Section 6* and include clinical and family history, labora-­
tory tests, ECG, Holter monitoring, cardiac imaging, and genetic testing.
Echocardiography is central for the diagnosis and CMR provides more
detailed morphological and prognostic information. Additional labora-­
tory tests, exercise testing, EMB, cardiac CT, and cardiac catheteriza-­
tion should also be considered, as detailed in *Section 6* .

*7.2.1.4. Echocardiography*
Comprehensive TTE is recommended for all DCM patients as it pro-­
vides all the relevant information on the global and regional LV anat-­
omy, function and haemodynamics, valvular heart disease, right heart
function, pulmonary pressure, atrial geometry, and associated fea-­
tures. [71] Advanced echocardiographic techniques (tissue Doppler and
speckle tracking deformation imaging) can allow the early detection
of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in specific situations (e.g. genetic
DCM carriers, recipients of known cardiotoxic chemotherapy). [71][,][74]

Contrast agents may be considered for better endocardial delinea-­
tion, to better depict the presence of hypertrabeculation, or to exclude
intraventricular thrombus. Transoesophageal echocardiography is rare-­
ly necessary except for when atrial thrombi are present in patients with
AF, or for assessing valvular function and guiding transcatheter therapy
in patients with concomitant secondary mitral or tricuspid
regurgitation.

ESC Guidelines **3563**


*7.2.1.5. Cardiac magnetic resonance*

Cardiac magnetic resonance provides additional information on tissue
characterization in patients with DCM, including the presence of myo-­
cardial oedema, which may suggest a myocarditic or inflammatory
cause, and LGE, to determine the presence and extent of fibrosis, as
well as its distribution, which may allow exclusion of myocardial infarc-­
tion and also point towards specific aetiologies (e.g. subepicardial distri-­
bution in post-myocarditis forms, patchy in sarcoidosis, extensive
inferolateral in dystrophinopathies, septal mid-wall in *LMNA* carriers,
and ring-like in *DSP* and *FLNC* -truncating variant carriers) (see *Section*
*7.3* ). [71][,][847] Late gadolinium enhancement distribution and extent hold
prognostic value both for arrhythmia and heart failure severity. [137][,][848]

Dedicated T2* sequences describe myocardial iron deposition, which
is useful for the diagnosis of haemochromatosis. [71]

*7.2.1.6. Nuclear medicine*

There is a limited role for radionuclide imaging in DCM. Measurement
of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake using PET, with focal or
focal-on-diffuse FDG uptake patterns especially if there is concomitant
abnormal 18F-FDG-PET uptake in extracardiac tissues, can be useful in
suspected cardiac sarcoidosis. [849]

**7.2.2. Genetic testing and family screening**

The aetiology of DCM is highly heterogeneous and includes inherited
(genetic/familial) and acquired causes. [9][,][545][,][850][,][851] Direct causes of
DCM include pathogenic gene variants, toxins, auto-immunity, infec-­
tions, storage diseases, and tachyarrhythmias. Monogenic gene variants
causing DCM are highly heterogeneous, implicating many genes and di-­
verse pathways. Moreover, only 30–40% of DCM cases are attributable
to pathogenic rare variants, with a substantial polygenic/common vari-­
ant contribution in this population. Furthermore, disease modifiers can
play a role in the acceleration of the DCM phenotype. [7][,][9][,][850] This in-­
cludes conditions that may aggravate or trigger DCM, including epigen-­
etic factors and acquired modifiers, such as pregnancy, hypertension,
excessive alcohol use, and other toxins. [42][–][44] It is important to consider
the interplay between genetic and acquired causes during the diagnostic
work-up. Identification of an acquired cause does not exclude an under-­
lying causative gene variant, whereas the latter may require an addition-­
al acquired cause and/or disease modifier to manifest. Within the genes
that can cause DCM, there are genes robustly associated with classical
DCM that have been recently curated, [189] and also others classically as-­
sociated with ARVC but that very commonly can present with LV dila-­
tation and predominantly LV dysfunction. Moreover, genes described in
the context of hypertrabeculation/LVNC (e.g. *NKX2.5* and *PRDM16* ),
or that can cause DCM with or without skeletal involvement (such as
*DMD* or *EMD* ), should also be considered DCM-associated genes and
examined, particularly if phenotype is concordant. The most common
genetic and acquired causes of DCM are shown in *Table 10* and
*Table 20* . Detailed lists of causes of DCM have been previously
published. [9][,][852]

*7.2.2.1. Genetic testing*
Causative gene variants occur in up to 40% of DCM patients in contem-­
porary cohorts, [185][,][186][,][853][,][854] and between 10 and 15% in
chemotherapy-induced, alcoholic, or peripartum DCM. [42][–][44] Although
the prevalence of genetic variants is higher in familial DCM, causative
genetic variants are also identified in over 20% of non-familial DCM
cases. [185][,][854][,][855] Finding a causative gene variant in a patient with
DCM allows better prediction of the disease outcome and progression,

may contribute to the indications for device implantation, informs gen-­
etic counselling, and allows familial screening for relatives. Moreover,
genetic testing in DCM has long-term implications in terms of costeffectiveness by identifying at-risk family members with positive geno-­
types, and thus reducing the number of family members requiring serial
clinical follow-up. [229] Genetic testing can therefore be beneficial in all
patients with DCM, including children [856][,][857] and those with alcohol-/
chemotherapy-induced and peripartum DCM. Where resources are
limited, scores designed to identify DCM patients with a high probabil-­
ity of a positive genotype (e.g. the Madrid DCM Genotype Score

[[https://madridDCMscore.com]) may be considered to prioritize gen-­](https://madridDCMscore.com)
etic testing. [858] Of note, age should not be a limiting factor when decid-­
ing which DCM patients should undergo genetic testing. [185][,][858][,][859]

Recommendations for clinical screening, genetic counselling, and
testing are described in *Sections 6.8.3* and *6.11* . More detailed evalu-­
ation of conduction defects or arrhythmia, which may be an early pres-­
entation of certain genetic DCM subtypes, should be considered in the
context of certain gene variants (e.g. *LMNA*, *EMD*, *DES* ). Cardiac MRI

should also be considered in relatives with normal cardiac function

who carry causative genetic variants associated with increased risk of
SCD (e.g. *FLNC*, *DES*, *DSP*, *PLN*, *LMNA*, *TMEM43*, *RMB20* ). If there
are no additional family members with DCM, other than the proband,
periodic evaluation of first-degree relatives should follow the same in-­
tervals according to age (see *Section 6.11* ), but termination of periodic
surveillance in families in whom a genetic variant has not been identified
could be considered in first-degree relatives ≥50 years of age with nor-­
mal ECG and normal cardiac imaging tests.

**7.2.3. Assessment of symptoms**

Patients with DCM often develop symptoms of heart failure, although
this can occur many years after the appearance of ECG or echocardio-­
graphic abnormalities. Assessment of symptoms in patients with cardio-­
myopathies is described in *Section 6.10.1* .

**7.2.4. Management**

The clinical management of heart failure and other manifestations of
DCM has been described in the *2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis*
*and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure*, the *2020 ESC*
*Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation*, and the
*2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization ther-­*
*apy* . [69][,][336][,][724] In these guidelines, recommendations are generally inde-­
pendent of the aetiology of heart failure, AF, and other clinical
presentations. As such, although they summarize large and robust da-­
tasets and trials, the treatment recommendations must be regarded
as generic and not specific to the different forms of genetic DCM.
However, as large cohorts of genetic DCMs with uniform genetic fea-­
tures are relatively rare, adequately powered RCTs in cardiomyop-­
athies are scarce. The Task Force therefore recommends applying
the *2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and*
*chronic heart failure*, which contain treatment guidelines for patients
with signs and symptoms of heart failure, for symptom management
of patients with DCM. [69] Treatment recommendations for asymptom-­
atic LV dysfunction or dilatation are scarce, which presents a challenge
for genetic DCM, where a sizeable proportion of the patients are young
with no or mild symptoms, and where asymptomatic patients are fre-­
quently discovered through cascade screening. Recommendations for
the pharmacological management of heart failure symptoms in patients
with cardiomyopathies are described in *Section 6.10.2* .


**7.2.5. Sudden cardiac death prevention in dilated**
**cardiomyopathy**

Predicting SCD is a challenging aspect of the clinical care of patients
with DCM. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators are effective at treat-­
ing potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias and preventing SCD, but
are also associated with complications, particularly in young patients,
who will require several replacements during their lifetimes (see
*Section 6.10.5* ).

*7.2.5.1. Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death*
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators reduce mortality in survivors of
cardiac arrest and in patients who have experienced sustained symp-­
tomatic ventricular arrhythmias with haemodynamic compromise. [531]

An ICD is recommended in such patients when the intent is to increase
survival; the decision to implant should consider the patient’s view and
their QoL, as well as the absence of other diseases likely to cause death
within the following year.

*7.2.5.2. Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death*

Available RCTs examining the usefulness of ICDs to prevent SCD and
improve survival have included only patients with LVEF ≤35%, with
conflicting results. While a trial including both ischaemic and nonischaemic symptomatic heart failure patients showed reduction in
mortality, [860] trials including only patients without CAD did not signifi-­
cantly improve the overall risk of mortality despite the fact that there
was an absolute reduction in SCD with ICDs, and subgroup analysis
suggested that there was a survival benefit in patients ≤70 years. [861][,][862]

Nevertheless, in a recent meta-analysis of studies that examined the
effect of ICDs in DCM, a survival benefit was observed, although
the effect was modest compared with LVEF ≤35% patients with
CAD. [863]

Although LVEF ≤35% has been reported as an independent risk
marker of all-cause and cardiac death in DCM, it has also shown only
modest ability in identifying DCM patients with higher risk of SCD, sug-­
gesting that additional factors should be taken into consideration when
deciding on ICD implantation in a disease with significant aetiological
heterogeneity. Recent natural history studies suggest that phenotype
plays a role a role in SCD risk, with patients harbouring disease-causing
variants in *PLN*, *DSP*, *LMNA*, *FLNC*, *TMEM43*, and *RBM20* having a sub-­
stantially higher rate of major arrhythmic events than other causes of
DCM regardless of LVEF. [440][,][542][,][864][–][870] A recent retrospective study
of 1161 individuals with DCM has shown that DCM patients with P/
LP DCM-causing genetic variants have a worse clinical evolution and
higher rate of major arrhythmic events than genotype-negative DCM
patients and particularly in DCM patients with LVEF ≤35%. [185] The
study also observed a higher risk of major arrhythmic events in DCM
patients affected by DCM-causing variants in certain genotypes regard-­
less of LVEF. Genes associated with higher arrhythmic risk included
genes coding for nuclear envelope ( *LMNA*, *EMD*, *TMEM43* ), desmo-­
somal ( *DSP*, *DSG2*, *DSC2*, *PKP2* ), and certain cytoskeletal proteins. [185]

Together, these data suggest that DCM patients harbouring
DCM-causing variants in high-risk genes ( *LMNA*, *EMD*, *TMEM43*, *DSP*,
*RBM20*, *PLN*, *FLNC* -truncating variants) should be considered as pa-­
tients with a high-risk genetic background for SCD and primary preven-­
tion ICD implantation should be considered with LVEF thresholds
higher than 35%, particularly in the presence of additional risk factors
(e.g. NSVT, increased ventricular ectopic beats, male sex, significant
LGE, specific gene variant). For some high-risk genotypes (e.g. *LMNA*

[io/final_shiny])](https://plnriskcalculator.shinyapps.io/final_shiny) [542] risk-prediction scores have been developed that con-­
sider genotype characteristics and additional phenotypic features.
Where such scores are available, they should be used to guide primary
prevention ICD implantation ( *Figure 17* ). As discussed in *Section 7.1.5*,
the Task Force acknowledges the challenges associated with defining
universal thresholds for acceptable risk across different cardiomyop-­
athy phenotypes, but is of the opinion that a similar approach to that
taken in risk stratification for HCM is reasonable. Although the *2022*
*ESC Guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias*
*and the prevention of sudden cardiac death* have suggested a higher
threshold of 10% risk at 5 years to guide primary prevention ICD im-­
plantation in patients with DCM and *LMNA* variants, [3] this Task Force
recommends shared decision-making based on real-world data as
well as individual preferences, beliefs, circumstances, and values. Gaps
in evidence should be shared with patients, and competing risks related
to the disease (heart failure, stroke), and to age and comorbidity, as well
as device-related complications, should be discussed. In support of this,
a recent study validating the LMNA-risk VTA calculator overestimated
arrhythmic risk when using ≥7% predicted 5-year risk as threshold
(specificity 26%, C-statistic 0.85), despite a high sensitivity. [871]

Importantly, there are also data to suggest that other genotypes (e.g.
*TTN* truncating variants) are associated with recovery of LVEF with


standard heart failure criteria from the *2021 ESC Guidelines for the diag-­*
*nosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure* . [185][,][867][,][872]

In patients without a high-risk genotype and LVEF >35%, the pres-­
ence and extent of myocardial scarring determined by LGE on CMR im-­
aging can be helpful in risk stratification in patients with DCM. [873][,][874]

Late gadolinium enhancement is observed in 25–35% of patients with
DCM and its presence is a strong risk marker for all-cause mortality
and ventricular arrhythmias, both in retrospective and prospective
studies. A recent prospective study of 1020 DCM patients with a me-­
dian follow-up of 5.2 years showed that myocardial scar had a strong
and incremental prognostic value for predicting SCD, while LVEF
≤35% was not associated with SCD. [138] In another study, a risk calcula-­
tor was developed that among others, incorporated the presence of
LGE on CMR imaging [540], although this has not yet been externally va-­
lidated. There are at least two ongoing trials of ICD therapy according
to the presence of scar on CMR imaging, including DCM patients
(NCT04558723 and NCT03993730), but the Task Force’s opinion is
that the existing level of evidence can support using LGE to guide
ICD implantation in subgroups of patients with DCM ( *Figure 17* ).
Additional risk factors, such as syncope or the presence of NSVT and
burden of ventricular ectopy (VE), may also help guide ICD implant-­
ation. There are no data currently to support a specific threshold for
VE burden, and this will depend on the underlying genotype and other

**3566** ESC Guidelines


clinical factors. [542][,][867][,][872] In patients with unexplained syncope, pro-­
grammed electrical stimulation (PES) may provide additional informa-­
tion on the underlying cause. [875] There are no definitive data
supporting the routine use of PES for primary prevention risk stratifica-­
tion in patients with DCM, but this may be beneficial in patients with
DCM and myotonic dystrophy with an independent indication to elec-­
trophysiological study to assess conduction disturbances, [876] although
the clinical value of this approach has not been consistently
demonstrated. [877]

The non-dilated LV cardiomyopathy phenotype is defined by the pres-­

malities, or isolated global LV hypokinesia without scarring (as assessed

by the presence of LGE on CMR) that is unexplained solely by abnormal
loading conditions (hypertension, valve disease) or CAD. Global LV sys-­
tolic dysfunction is defined by abnormal LVEF (i.e. <50%). [9]

*7.3.1.2. Relatives*

Clinical testing in relatives may reveal non-diagnostic abnormalities. In
this context, the presence of LV systolic global or regional dysfunction,
or additional electrocardiographic abnormalities (e.g. repolarization ab-­
normalities, low QRS voltages, frequent ventricular extrasystoles

[>500 per 24 h] or NSVT) in a first-degree relative of an individual
with NDLVC (or a first-degree relative with autopsy-proven
NDLVC) is highly suggestive of NDLVC and warrants close follow-up.

In the absence of conclusive genetic information in the family,
NDLVC should be considered familial if one or more first- or seconddegree relatives have NDLVC, or when SCD has occurred in a firstdegree relative at any age with an established diagnosis of NDLVC.
Familial disease should also be suspected if a first-degree relative has
sudden death at <50 years of age and autopsy findings suggestive of
the NDLVC phenotype.

*7.3.1.3. Diagnostic work-up*

The key elements of the diagnostic work-up for all patients with
NDLVC are described in *Section 6* and include clinical history, labora-­
tory tests, Holter monitoring and cardiac imaging, and genetic testing.

ESC Guidelines **3567**


Echocardiography and CMR are both central to the diagnosis.
Additional laboratory tests, exercise testing, EMB, and cardiac catheter-­
ization may also be considered (see *Section 6* ).

*7.3.1.4. Electrocardiographic features*
Recommendations on resting and ambulatory ECG testing are de-­
scribed in *Section 6.5* and are of particular importance in patients
with NDLVC, as specific features can indicate the underlying genetic
cause. Prolonged PR interval or AV block is frequent in neuromuscular
causes of NDLVC and in sarcoidosis. Laminopathies are characterized
by prolonged PR interval, AF, and ventricular ectopics (VEs), and fre-­
quently show low voltage in pre-cordial leads. [887] Depolarization abnor-­
malities such as low QRS voltage are also a common finding in NDLVC
caused by *DSP* and *PLN* variants. [542] Ambulatory ECG monitoring is use-­
ful in NDLVC patients to reveal supraventricular and ventricular ar-­
rhythmias or bradycardias due to AV conduction block and is
recommended at least yearly, or when there is a change in clinical sta-­
tus. In some patients with NDLVC at high risk of developing conduction
disease and/or arrhythmias (including laminopathies, neuromuscular
disease, *PLN*, and *FLNC* -truncating variants), Holter monitoring may
be considered more frequently.

*7.3.1.5. Echocardiography*

Comprehensive TTE is recommended for all patients with NDLVC as it
provides all relevant information on the global and regional LV anatomy,
function, and haemodynamics; valvular heart disease; right heart func-­
tion; pulmonary pressure; atrial geometry; and other features. [71][,][73]

Advanced echocardiographic techniques (including deformation im-­
aging using tissue Doppler and speckle tracking) can allow the early de-­
tection of subclinical myocardial dysfunction in specific situations (e.g.
genetic NDLVC carriers). [71][,][74]

*7.3.1.6. Cardiac magnetic resonance*

Cardiac magnetic resonance with LGE is the foremost imaging modality
in NDLVC as it provides confirmation of the presence of non-ischaemic
myocardial fibrosis that is essential for the diagnosis in most cases.
Cardiac magnetic resonance can also be useful to detect the presence
of myocardial oedema, which may suggest an inflammatory or myocar-­
ditic aetiology, and to describe the extent and pattern of fibrosis
distribution. This can provide clues to the underlying aetiology (e.g. sub-­
epicardial distribution in post-myocarditis forms, patchy in sarcoidosis,
extensive inferolateral in dystrophinopathies, septal mid-wall in *LMNA*
carriers, and ring-like in *DSP* and *FLNC* variant carriers), [71] and may pro-­
vide additional prognostic value both for arrhythmia and heart failure
severity. [137][,][848]


*7.3.1.7. Nuclear medicine*

The role of radionuclide imaging in NDLVC is limited. Measurement of
18F-FDG uptake using PET, with focal or focal-on-diffuse FDG uptake
patterns, especially if concomitant abnormal 18F-FDG-PET uptake in
extracardiac tissues, can be useful in suspected cardiac sarcoidosis. [849]

Isolated cardiac uptake has also been described in patients with
NDLVC caused by *DSP* variants. [888]

*7.3.1.8. Endomyocardial biopsy*
Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with immunohistochemical quantifi-­
cation of inflammatory cells remains the gold standard investigation
for the identification of cardiac inflammation. It may confirm the
diagnosis of autoimmune disease in patients with unexplained heart
failure and suspected giant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocardi-­
tis, vasculitis, and sarcoidosis. In experienced centres, electroanato-­
mical voltage mapping-guided EMB may improve the yield of
diagnosis of NDLVC. [889] The risks and benefits of EMB should be
evaluated and this procedure should be reserved for specific situa-­
tions where its results may affect diagnosis or treatment (see
*Section 6.7.5* ).

**7.3.2. Genetic testing**
The genes most commonly implicated in NDLVC are *DSP*, *FLNC* (trun-­
cating variants), *DES*, *LMNA*, or *PLN*, but there is substantial overlap
with the genetic background of both DCM and ARVC ( *Table 10* ).
Desmoplakin ( *DSP* ) variants, in particular, cause a unique form of car-­
diomyopathy with a high prevalence of LV fibrosis and myocardial in-­
flammatory episodes. [864]

The identification of a P/LP gene variant in a patient with NDLVC al-­
lows better prediction of the disease outcome and progression, may
contribute to the indications for device implantation, informs genetic
counselling, and allows familial screening for relatives (see *Section*
*6.8.3* ). Therefore, genetic testing is recommended in all patients with

NDLVC.

Recommendations for clinical screening, genetic counselling, and
testing are described in *Sections 6.8.3* and *6.11* . Evaluation of conduc-­
tion disease, and atrial and ventricular arrhythmia, is of particular im-­
portance in patients with NDLVC, as these may often be early
phenotypic features. There are very few data on the natural history
of phenotype-negative variant carriers or on the clinical yield of familial
cascade screening in NDLVC, but cross-sectional studies suggest
age-related increases in penetrance. [9] Precautionary long-term evalu-­
ation of first-degree relatives is therefore recommended.

**7.3.3. Assessment of symptoms**

Most patients with NDLVC are asymptomatic, but some develop
symptoms related to arrhythmia or conduction disease (e.g. syncope,
palpitation) or diastolic heart failure (e.g. dyspnoea). Sustained ventricu-­
lar arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or SCD can be the initial presentation in a
proportion of patients. Assessment of symptoms in patients with car-­
diomyopathies is described in *Section 6.10.1* .

**7.3.4. Management**

The clinical management of heart failure and other manifestations of
NDLVC (atrial tachyarrhythmia, conduction disease) has been de-­
scribed in the *2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of*
*acute and chronic heart failure*, the *2020 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis*
*and management of atrial fibrillation*, the *2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiac*

**3568** ESC Guidelines


*pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy*, and the *2022 ESC Guidelines*
*for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the pre-­*
*vention of sudden cardiac death*, [69][,][299][,][336][,][724] and are discussed in

*Section 6.10.2* .

**7.3.5. Sudden cardiac death prevention in non-dilated**
**left ventricular cardiomyopathy**

The prediction and prevention of SCD is the cornerstone of the clinical
care of patients with NDLVC.

*7.3.5.1. Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death*
As in other cardiomyopathy subtypes, ICD implantation is recom-­
mended in survivors of cardiac arrest and in patients who have experi-­
enced sustained ventricular arrhythmias with haemodynamic
compromise; [531] the decision to implant should consider the patient’s
view and their QoL, as well as the absence of other diseases likely to
cause death within 1 year.

*7.3.5.2. Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death*

There are no available RCTs examining the usefulness of ICDs to
prevent SCD in patients with mild or moderate LV dysfunction.
Recommendations for ICD implantation in DCM individuals with
LVEF <35% are discussed in *Section 6.10.2* and also apply to pa-­
tients with NDLVC and LVEF <35%. Most patients with NDLVC,
however, have either normal or mildly impaired LV systolic func-­
tion. Much of the data on the natural history and risk prediction
in NDLVC are derived from cohorts that include either patients
with DCM or with ARVC (see *Sections 7.2* and *7.4* ), and data on
patients with NDLVC are therefore necessarily very limited.
However, the available data suggest that genotype is a major deter-­
minant of SCD risk, with patients harbouring variants in *PLN*,
*TMEM43*, *DES*, *DSP*, *LMNA*, *FLNC* (truncating variants), and
*RBM20* having a substantially higher rate of major arrhythmic events
than other causes regardless of LVEF. [440][,][542][,][864][–][869] For some
high-risk genotypes (e.g. *LMNA* [[https://lmna-risk-vta.fr]](https://lmna-risk-vta.fr) [541] ),
gene-specific (or, in the case of the *PLN* p.Arg14del variant, variant[specific [https://plnriskcalculator.shinyapps.io/final_shiny])](https://plnriskcalculator.shinyapps.io/final_shiny) [542] riskprediction scores have been developed that consider genotype
characteristics and additional phenotypic features. Where such
scores are available, they should be used to guide primary preven-­
tion ICD implantation ( *Figure 12* ). As discussed in *Sections 7.1.5* and
*7.2.5*, the Task Force acknowledges the challenges associated with
defining universal thresholds for acceptable risk across different car-­
diomyopathy phenotypes, but is of the opinion that a similar ap-­
proach to that taken in risk stratification for HCM is reasonable,
although the *2022 ESC Guidelines for the management of patients*
*with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death*
have suggested a higher threshold of 10% risk at 5 years to guide
primary prevention ICD implantation in patients with NDLVC
and *LMNA* variants. [3] This Task Force recommends more overt

shared decision-making based on real-world data as well as individ-­
ual preferences, beliefs, circumstances, and values. Gaps in evidence
are acknowledged and should be shared with patients, and compet-­
ing risks related to the disease (heart failure, stroke) and to age and
comorbidity, as well as device-related complications, should be

discussed.

There are very few data to guide risk stratification in patients with
NDLVC without a known causative gene variant, but on the basis of
the existing literature, the Task Force suggests that it may be reasonable


to consider primary prevention ICD implantation in patients with
NSVT, a family history of SCD, or significant LGE. Additional risk fac-­
tors, such as the burden of VE, may also help guide ICD implantation,
but there are no data currently to support a specific threshold for
VE burden, and this will depend on the underlying genotype and other
clinical factors. [542][,][867][,][872] In patients with unexplained syncope, PES may
provide additional information on the underlying cause. [875] There are no
definitive data supporting the regular use of PES for primary prevention
risk stratification in patients with NDLVC, but may be beneficial in pa-­
tients with NDLVC and myotonic dystrophy with an independent indi-­
cation to EP study to assess conduction disturbances, [876] although the
clinical value of this approach has not been consistently demon-­
strated. [877] Given the overlap with DCM and available data, and in keep-­
ing with the *2022 ESC Guidelines for the management of patients with*
*ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death*, the
Task Force agreed that the recommendations for primary prevention
ICD implantation in NDLVC should be the same as those for DCM
( *Figure 17* ), but the level of evidence is necessarily lower.

**7.4. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular**
**cardiomyopathy**
**7.4.1. Diagnosis**
*7.4.1.1. Index case*

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is charac-­
terized structurally by a progressive myocardial atrophy with fibro-fatty
replacement of the RV myocardium. [890] Lesions can also be present in
the LV myocardium; predominant LV disease can coexist in the same
family. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy usually mani-­
fests in the second to fourth decade of life. [891] Men are affected more

frequently than women and an age-related penetrance has been de-­
monstrated, with high clinical and genetic variability.

An ARVC diagnosis should be suspected in adolescents or young
adults with palpitations, syncope, or aborted sudden death. Frequent
VEs or VT of LBBB morphology are among the most common clinical
presentation. The presence of right pre-cordial TWI (V1–V3) in routine
ECG testing should also be suspected for ARVC. [10][,][892] Less common
ECG changes include low QRS voltages in the peripheral leads and ter-­
minal activation delay in the right pre-cordial leads. [893] Right ventricular
dilatation on 2D echocardiography is also a frequent reason for patient
referral. Less common presentations are RV or biventricular heart fail-­
ure that can mimic DCM or NDLVC. [894] Patients with multiple variants
are thought to develop a more severe phenotype, and patients with a
*DSP* or *DSG2* variant are more prone to develop heart failure. [895][,][896]

In children and young adults, syncope, palpitations, and ventricular
arrhythmias are also the usual presenting symptoms. [897] However,
chest pain, dynamic ST-T wave changes on basal 12-lead ECG, and myo-­
cardial enzymes release in the setting of normal coronary arteries are
often reported, requiring differential diagnosis with myocarditis or
acute myocardial infarction. [898]

*7.4.1.2. Relatives*

Clinical testing in relatives often reveals non-diagnostic abnormalities. In
this context, the presence of RV systolic global or regional dysfunction,
or additional electrocardiographic abnormalities (e.g. repolarization ab-­
normalities, prolonged terminal activation duration, low QRS voltages,
frequent ventricular extrasystoles [>500 per 24 h], or NSVT) in a firstdegree relative of an individual with ARVC (or a first-degree relative
with autopsy-proven ARVC) is highly suggestive of ARVC and warrants
close follow-up.

*7.4.1.3. Diagnostic work-up*

The key elements of the diagnostic work-up for all patients with ARVC
are defined by the diagnostic criteria used for the identification of af-­
fected individuals. The revised Task Force criteria for the diagnosis of
ARVC published by Marcus *et al.* in 2010 have been used for the diag-­
nosis of ARVC for more than a decade. [10] More recently, the Padua cri-­
teria have offered an updated iteration to include LV involvement but
are yet to be externally validated. [5] Key elements of the diagnostic workup include ECG, Holter monitoring, cardiac imaging, genetic testing,
and, in specific circumstances, EMB. [4][,][10][,][892] Additional laboratory tests,
exercise testing, and cardiac catheterization should also be considered,

as detailed in *Section 6* .

*7.4.1.4. Electrocardiography and Holter monitoring*
Abnormalities of the repolarization and depolarization as well as ar-­
rhythmias are key to the diagnosis of ARVC. [5] The diagnostic utility
of late potentials on signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG)


has been challenged in patients with ARVC for showing poor sensitiv-­
ity and specificity. [5][,][899] It has been noted that epsilon waves are fre-­
quently overdiagnosed and that there is poor agreement even
between experts regarding their presence. [900] Furthermore, it has
been demonstrated that they occur in the presence of severe struc-­
tural disease and thus add little to the diagnosis. [900][,][901] Therefore, ep-­
silon waves and SAECG should be utilized for diagnostic purposes

with caution.

*7.4.1.5. Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance*

A comprehensive cardiac imaging assessment is recommended for all
ARVC patients. [71][,][73] Structural and functional alterations assessed by
echocardiography and CMR are key to ARVC diagnosis. [10] The key fea-­
ture is the presence of wall motional abnormalities such as RV akinesia,
dyskinesia, or bulging, and the determinant of the diagnostic perform-­
ance is the level of RV dilatation or dysfunction (major and minor cri-­
teria). Cardiac magnetic resonance should be considered the first-line
test for assessment of the RV functional structural abnormalities criter-­
ion as it has demonstrated superior sensitivity. [10] Contrast-enhanced
CMR is the only tool allowing the detection of LV involvement which
remains otherwise underestimated by applying the 2010 Task Force
Criteria. Tissue characterization by CMR or indirectly by electroanato-­
mical voltage mapping may show signs of fibro-fatty replacement that
can be present in either ventricle. [889][,][903][,][904]

*7.4.1.6. Endomyocardial biopsy*
Differential diagnosis in patients with suspected ARVC includes inflam-­
matory processes affecting the right ventricle such as myocarditis and
sarcoidosis. In some instances, especially when dealing with probands
with a sporadic form, EMB may be helpful to rule out myocarditis
and sarcoidosis. [72][,][892][,][905] Endomyocardial biopsy can also be useful in
selected patients in whom non-invasive assessment is inconclusive. [4][,][72]

Electroanatomic voltage mapping-guided EMB may be considered in se-­
lected cases, particularly in case of negative CMR. [906]

*7.4.1.7. Nuclear medicine*

Measurement of 18F-FDG uptake using PET, with focal or
focal-on-diffuse FDG uptake patterns, can be useful in suspected car-­
diac sarcoidosis. [849] However, it has been demonstrated that patients
with ARVC can also show myocardial 18F-FDG-PET uptake. [888][,][907]

Therefore, there is a limited role for radionuclide imaging in ARVC un-­
less there is concomitant abnormal 18F-FDG-PET uptake in extracar-­
diac tissues, or other clinical features suggestive of cardiac
sarcoidosis. [904][,][908]

**3570** ESC Guidelines


*7.4.1.8. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy*
*phenocopies*
In suspicion of ARVC, a systematic approach to investigation of pheno-­
copies should be undertaken. Differential diagnosis in patients with sus-­
pected ARVC includes myocarditis, sarcoidosis, RV infarction, DCM,
Chagas disease, pulmonary hypertension, and CHD with volume over-­
load (such as Ebstein anomaly, atrial septal defect, and partial anomal-­
ous venous return, left-to-right shunt, and pericardial agenesis). [909][,][910]

Disease phenocopies also include non-structural diseases. In fact, one
of the main diagnostic dilemmas is to distinguish ARVC from idiopathic
RV outflow tract VT, since the latter is usually benign. [4] The idiopathic
nature of VT is supported by the absence of family history, a normal
basal 12-lead ECG, a normal ventricular structure by cardiac imaging
and electroanatomic mapping, a single VT morphology, and the noninducibility at programmed ventricular stimulation.

In highly trained competitive athletes, differential diagnosis with
physiological adaptation to training needs to be considered. [911] Right
ventricular enlargement, ECG abnormalities, and arrhythmias reflect
the increased haemodynamic load during exercise. While global RV sys-­
tolic dysfunction and/or RWMAs, such as bulgings or aneurysms, are
more in keeping with ARVC, the absence of overt structural changes
of the right ventricle, frequent VEs, or inverted T waves in pre-cordial
leads all support a benign nature (so-called athlete’s heart). [72][,][912][,][913]

**7.4.2. Genetic testing and family screening**

The genes underlying ARVC mainly encode proteins of the cardiac
desmosome: plakophilin-2 ( *PKP2* ), desmoplakin ( *DSP* ), desmoglein-2
( *DSG2* ), desmocollin-2 ( *DSC2* ), and plakoglobin ( *JUP* ). In addition to
desmosomal genes, P/LP variants have also been described in other
genes, including *DES*, [914] *TMEM43*, [915] and *PLN* . [190][,][882] Pathogenic or like-­
ly pathogenic variants can be identified in up to 60% of patients with a
diagnosis of ARVC. [230] Given the diagnostic importance of genetic test-­
ing in ARVC, it is important that genetic variants are frequently reappraised in terms of their pathogenicity. [916] The pattern of inheritance
in the majority of ARVC families is autosomal dominant. The pene-­
trance of the disease in genetic carriers is age, gender, and physical ac-­
tivity dependent. [892][,][917]

Recommendations for clinical screening, genetic counselling, and
testing are described in *Sections 6.8.3* and *6.11* . Cardiac evaluation
should be adapted to the particular risk of complications in the family.
Evaluation every 1–2 years including ECG, ECHO, and Holter/ECG
monitoring is generally recommended for relatives at risk of developing
the disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance should be considered at the

baseline evaluation.

**7.4.3. Assessment of symptoms**
Patients with ARVC commonly experience palpitations and can de-­
velop symptoms of heart failure, although this may occur many years
after the appearance of the initial abnormalities. Assessment of symp-­
toms in patients with cardiomyopathies is described in *Section 6.10.1* .

**7.4.4. Management**
The aim of the clinical management of ARVC relies on the improve-­
ment of symptoms, the reduction of the pace of disease progression,
and the prevention of complications. Recommendations for the
pharmacological management of atrial arrhythmias and heart failure
symptoms in patients with cardiomyopathies are described in *Sections*

*6.10.2* and *6.10.3* .


*7.4.4.1. Antiarrhythmic therapy*
Beta-blockers constitute the first option to reduce arrhythmic burden
via a reduction in adrenergic tone, particularly on exercise. Titration to
the maximal tolerated dose has been associated with an improvement
in survival from major ventricular arrhythmias in retrospective observa-­
tional studies. [918]

Amiodarone is often used when other beta-blockers fail to control
arrhythmias. [917][,][919][,][920] It should, however, be used with caution for
the long-term management of ventricular arrhythmias, especially in
young patients. Sotalol has been used for many years, but evidence re-­
garding its efficacy remain limited and conflicting. [921][,][922] Flecainide
should be considered when single agent treatment has failed to control
arrhythmia-related symptoms in patients with ARVC or when auto-­
nomic side effects limit the use of beta-blockers. [923][,][924] Experience
with other antiarrhythmics (dofetilide, ranolazine) is limited to very
small case series. [919][,][923]

A proportion of patients require invasive arrhythmic procedures
and/or ICD implantation. Complex endocardial and/or epicardial ap-­
proach guided by three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomical mapping
can be recommended but with a high recurrence rate (30–50% in ex-­
perienced centres). [919][,][925][–][927] Sympathetic denervation has also been
used. [928] Such procedures do not confer adequate protection against
SCD, but may be very useful in reducing the VT burden and the risk
of electrical storm. [917] Discontinuation of intense physical exercise
has shown a potential to slow the pace of disease progression and re-­
duce the ventricular arrhythmia burden. [917][,][919]

**7.4.5. Sudden cardiac death prevention in**
**arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy**

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is characterized by its
high propensity for ventricular arrhythmias and SCD. [919] Although esti-­
mated to be a rare disease, it has been consistently reported as one of




ESC Guidelines **3571**


the most common causes of SCD in registries around the world. [935][–][937]

Sudden cardiac death seems to be more prevalent in young athletic in-­
dividuals affected by the disease. [935][,][938]

*7.4.5.1. Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death*
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators reduce mortality in survivors of
cardiac arrest and in patients who have experienced sustained symp-­
tomatic ventricular arrhythmias. [531] An ICD is recommended in such
patients when the intent is to increase survival; the decision to implant
should consider the patient’s view and their QoL, as well as the absence
of other diseases likely to cause death within the following year.

*7.4.5.2. Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death*

Most of the current evidence on the outcomes of patients with ARVC
and their predictors is limited to observational retrospective cohort
studies that are typically of small size. [939] Thus, the number of clinical pre-­
dictors that can be studied using multivariate models is very limited, and
most studies cannot be compared with one another. A systematic review
and meta-analysis ( *n* = 18 studies) has shown that the average risk of ven-­
tricular arrhythmia ranges from 3.7 to 10.6% per year and that male sex,
RV dysfunction, and prior non-sustained or sustained VT/VF consistently
predict ventricular arrhythmias in populations with ARVC. [939]

The first comprehensive effort to offer an approach to risk stratifica-­
tion in the context of decision-making for ICD implantation was made
in the 2015 International Task Force consensus statement (ITFC) on
the treatment of ARVC/dysplasia, where recommendations were
made according to the presence of risk factors that would characterize
the risk level of each patient. [919] A follow-up study ( *n* = 365) offered a
modification on the International Task Force approach that resulted in
better discrimination. [940] The *2017 AHA/ACC/HRS guideline for manage-­*
*ment of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden*
*cardiac death* [941] and the *2019 HRS expert consensus statement on evalu-­*
*ation, risk stratification, and management of arrhythmogenic cardiomyop-­*
*athy* [4] have also offered alternative approaches to this issue. A
risk-prediction model was developed from a multicentre collaboration
( *n* = 528); it utilizes sex, age, recent syncope, NSVT, VE count, number
of leads with TWI, and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) as pre-­
dictors to provide an individualized estimate of sustained ventricular ar-­
[rhythmias in patients with ARVC (arvcrisk.com).](https://arvcrisk.com) [539]

A study ( *n* = 617) comparing the previous approaches to risk stratify
patients has revealed that the modified ITFC approach provides the
highest net benefit, up to an estimated 5-year risk of 25%, whereas
AHA and HRS perform best in patients with an estimated 5-year risk
>25%. [538] In the same study, an estimated 5-year risk of 12.5% seems
to be the optimal threshold, beyond which the risk-prediction model
has the best performance. An external comparison ( *n* = 140) of the dif-­
ferent ARVC risk levels showed that the highest net benefit was seen
with a 10% cut-off, using the 2019 ARVC risk calculator. [536] In the
same study, the 10% cut-off was superior to the HRS and ITFC ap-­
proaches. [536] Another external validation study ( *n* = 128) of the 2019
ARVC risk model showed that although discriminative ability is excel-­
lent (c-index 0.84), the model seems to significantly overestimate the
risk of patients below the 50% 5-year risk threshold. [537] Recently, a cor-­
rection to the 2019 ARVC risk calculator was issued. [539] Two large ex-­
ternal validation studies of the updated 2019 ARVC risk calculator have
been published, suggesting a good discriminative performance, but the
latter study revealed overestimation of risk. [524][,][526] This raises concerns
regarding the accuracy of the model in offering an individualized predic-­
tion that can help inform patients during decision-making; however, it


can remain informative due to its excellent discriminative performance.
Furthermore, one study suggested that the updated 2019 ARVC risk
calculator performs best in *PKP2* patients, but its performance is
more limited in gene-negative individuals. [524]

Therefore, a combination of these approaches is recommended to
individualize risk quantification that can aid clinicians in balancing the
risks and benefits of ICD implantation. The final decision should be
made together with the patient, considering other competing risks
and the patient’s risk tolerance. As discussed in *Section 7.1.5*, the
Task Force acknowledges the challenges associated with defining uni-­
versal thresholds for acceptable risk across different cardiomyopathy
phenotypes, but is of the opinion that a similar approach to that taken
in risk stratification for HCM, DCM, and NDLVC is reasonable. In this
context, the Task Force recommends shared decision-making based on
real-world data as well as individual preferences, beliefs, circumstances,
and values. Gaps in evidence should be shared with patients, and com-­
peting risks related to the disease (heart failure, stroke) and to age and
comorbidity, as well as device-related complications, should be dis-­
cussed. The suggested approach is summarized in *Figure 18* .

Patients with ARVC are known to suffer from sustained VTs that can

be well tolerated without leading to SCD. Using appropriate ICD inter-­
ventions as surrogate for SCD outcome has been shown to overesti-­
mate SCD. [942] Considering that, in most centres, a high ratio of ARVC
patients will be implanted with an ICD, it is conceivable why this may
hamper risk stratification for SCD in patients with ARVC. Efforts to ad-­
dress this have been made within several studies, [522][,][523][,][943][–][947] where

the outcome of interest is fast VT (>250 b.p.m.) rather than any sus-­
tained VT. The largest of these studies ( *n* = 864) has led to the develop-­
ment of a separate score for the prediction of unstable VT/VF. [945] Due to
the lack of any external validation studies, there is insufficient informa-­
tion to support the applicability of this risk score outside of its develop-­
ment cohorts. Furthermore, a specific rate cut-off is also not well
evidence-based and its performance to predict SCD remains unclear.
Although it is likely that slower sustained VTs per se are not lifethreatening, it remains unknown how frequently they would degenerate
to faster VTs or VF. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that all patients
at risk of any sustained ventricular arrhythmia should be offered primary
prevention ICDs.

The role of PES in risk stratification of ARVC patients is not well de-­
fined, particularly in those who are asymptomatic. [523][,][939] However, cur-­
rent practice suggests that inducibility of SMVT at PES might add value
in patients with symptoms consistent with sustained ventricular ar-­
rhythmia and this is further supported in this guideline [3]

**7.5. Restrictive cardiomyopathy**
**7.5.1. Diagnosis**

Patients with overt RCM manifest signs and symptoms typical of
HFpEF. [306] The systematic approach to diagnosis should include clinical
examination, ECG, echocardiography, and CMR. [951] Physical examin-­
ation may show a prominent jugular venous pulse. In the advanced
phases, the pulse volume is low, the stroke volume declines, and the
heart rate may increase. Hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral oedema
are common in decompensated patients. Echocardiography is the gold
standard diagnostic tool; criteria for diagnosing and grading diastolic
dysfunction have been previously described. [951][,][952] Importantly, the de-­
gree of diastolic dysfunction in patients with RCM is often only truly re-­
strictive in advanced stages and most patients show milder grades of


diastolic impairment at diagnosis. [951] Cardiac catheterization should
be performed in cases where the diagnosis is in doubt and to aid in
the assessment for and timing of cardiac transplantation. [953] Cardiac
MRI distinguishes RCM from constrictive pericarditis, provides informa-­
tion on the presence and extent of myocardial fibrosis, and contributes
to distinguishing metabolic from inflammatory diseases. [951][,][954]

Endomyocardial biopsy is a precision diagnostic tool in restrictive
cardio-desminopathies; [955] iron myocardial overload, both intramyo-­
cyte in haemochromatosis [956] and mitochondrial in Friedreich ataxia
cardiomyopathy; [957] cystinosis; [958] generalized arterial calcification of in-­
fancy; [955][,][959] and lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). [960][,][961] Deep pheno-­
typing in probands should go beyond cardiac traits and explore
extracardiac manifestations in syndromic diseases and in RCM asso-­
ciated with neuromuscular disorders (see *Section 6* ). [962]

**7.5.2. Genetic testing**

When inherited, RCM most commonly presents as an autosomal
dominant disorder and, less commonly, autosomal recessive or spor-­
adic. Genes associated with RCM encode sarcomeric structural and

regulatory proteins and cytoskeletal intermediate filaments
( *Table 10* ). Although all major sarcomeric genes may cause RCM, [963]

the most common disease gene is *TNNI3*, which encodes the thin fila-­
ment troponin I. [964] Other less commonly involved genes include
*TNNT2*, *ACTC1*, *MYH7*, *MYBPC3*, *TTN*, *TPM1*, *MYPN*, *MYL3*, and

*MYL2* . Restrictive cardiomyopathy can be associated with intramyocyte
accumulation of unfolded defective proteins, a feature that is increas-­
ingly demonstrated in carriers of defects in *DES*, *FLNC*, and *BAG3* .
These diseases have significant implications for prognosis and timely
decision-making, both in children and adults. Restrictive cardiomyop-­
athy may also occur in individuals with a family history of HCM [289] or
DCM. [965] The observation of different cardiomyopathy phenotypes
within families suggests a variable response to the variant, and

in addition to offering an ICD. [b] High-risk features are defined as either cardiac syncope, NSVT, RVEF <40%, LVEF <45%, SMVT at PES or as per the updated

implicates factors beyond the specific variant in the determination of
ultimate clinical manifestation of disease. [966] Hereditary infiltrative dis-­
eases can also cause RCM, the most common of which is amyloidosis
caused by pathogenic variants in the *TTR* gene, although this is usually in
the presence of LVH (see *Section 7.7* ).

**7.5.3. Assessment of symptoms**

Patients with RCM often develop symptoms of heart failure, although
this can occur some years after the appearance of the initial abnormal-­
ities. Assessment of symptoms in patients with cardiomyopathies is de-­
scribed in *Section 6.10.1* .

**7.5.4. Management**

The administration of heart failure medications and device implantation,
including ventricular assist device as a bridge-to-candidacy is guided by


symptoms and heart failure phenotype and severity, [967] and is described
in *Section 6.10.2* . Precision diagnosis (phenotype and cause) is key to time-­
ly planning of heart transplantation as it guarantees the exclusion of all
genetic and acquired phenocopies that may be amenable to alternative
treatment. Prevention of heart transplantation in all RCM patients with
alternative treatments is a major goal for all adult and paediatric RCM.

Precise diagnosis is also essential for genetic phenocopies with avail-­
able target treatments: ERT for Anderson–Fabry disease or glycogeno-­
sis such as Pompe disease; therapeutic phlebotomy for
haemochromatosis; immunosuppressive therapeutics for sarcoidosis;
new biological drugs for systemic diseases (e.g. autoimmune diseases
with cardiac involvement that can reverse or stabilize by treating the
disease itself); and removal of the toxic causes (see *Figure 19* and
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data) *Table S4* ). Precision diagnosis today is es-­
sential due to the increasing availability of disease-specific treatments
and diagnostic tools to exclude geno/phenocopies.

**3574** ESC Guidelines


Restrictive cardiomyopathy is associated with the worst prognosis of
all the cardiomyopathy phenotypes. Survival data are limited to small
windows of observation. The prognosis of RCM largely depends on
the restrictive physiology, regardless of the underlying cause. [968][–][971]

More than 50% of children with RCM are at risk of death (including
SCD) or transplantation shortly after diagnosis; clinical features puta-­
tively associated with increased risk of death or transplantation include:
heart failure symptoms; reduced LV systolic function; increased left at-­
rial size; syncope; ischaemia; and impaired LV diastolic function on
echocardiography. [286][,][969][,][972][,][973] Up to 75% of surviving patients demon-­
strate heart failure, and the outcome is either death or heart transplant-­
ation within a few years of diagnosis. [968][,][969] Elevated pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR) is present in up to 40% of children with RCM, and can
rise quickly even in the absence of other clinical changes, which has an
impact on suitability for and timing of cardiac transplantation. [953]

Cardiac catheterization with an assessment of PVR is therefore recom-­
mended in all children at diagnosis and every 6 to 12 months. [953] In adult
patients with genetic RCM, the main cause of death is heart failure
(more than 40%), with a 5-year survival rate of ∼50% in cohorts that
include patients with HCM and restrictive physiology. [616]

**7.6. Syndromic and metabolic**
**cardiomyopathies**
It is beyond the scope of these guidelines to provide a detailed review
and recommendations on specific cardiomyopathy genocopies and
phenocopies. Instead, the Task Force refers the reader to detailed pos-­
ition statements and consensus documents published on behalf of the
ESC Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases (e.g. on
Anderson–Fabry Disease and amyloidosis ). [370][,][375][,][974] This section high-­
lights only the key diagnostic and management issues. *Table 22* sum-­
marizes the clinical features and management of syndromic and
metabolic cardiomyopathies.

**7.6.1. Anderson–Fabry disease**
*7.6.1.1. Definition*
Anderson–Fabry disease is an inborn error of metabolism where a de-­
ficient or absent enzyme, alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), due to a
pathogenic genetic variant in the *GLA* gene, causes the storage of
some degradation cell products, mainly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3)
in a patient’s lysosomes. [975] This storage causes cell dysfunction in its
own right and activates cellular hypertrophy pathways, common to
other causes of HCM, as well as inflammation and immune activa-­
tion. [976] It is a multisystem disorder affecting particularly the heart, kid-­
ney, and brain. [975] It is inherited in an X-linked manner; males are
therefore always affected, while females’ organ involvement usually de-­
velops later in life but can become similar to males due to the lyoniza-­
tion phenomena. [977][,][978]

Two Anderson–Fabry phenotypes can be distinguished, depending
on the gender, lyonization phenomena, and pathogenic genetic
variant: [976][,][979]

- A severe clinical phenotype, known as ‘classic’ Anderson–Fabry char-­

acterized by absent or severely reduced (<1% of mean normal) α-Gal
A activity, marked Gb3 accumulation, and childhood or adolescent
onset of symptoms followed by progressive multiorgan failure, is
most often seen in males (but not exclusively) without residual en-­
zyme activity.

- A **‘** non-classical’ Anderson–Fabry phenotype or later-onset pheno-­

type with incomplete systemic involvement, which is seen in both
males and females, with some level of residual enzyme activity, and
in most cases manifesting as isolated cardiac involvement.

*7.6.1.2. Diagnosis, clinical work-up, and differential diagnosis*

Anderson–Fabry disease should be suspected in patients with LVH and
additional cardiac and extracardiac red flags (see *Table 23* ) sought
( *Figure 20* ). The diagnosis is established by assessment of α-GalA activity
and lyso-Gb3 measurement in male patients; in females, genetic testing
is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. Severe LVH (>15 mm) is
unlikely to be seen in patients <20 years of age. [980] In children and ado-­
lescents, diagnosis is made by family history or based on other extracar-­
diac symptoms, but overt LVH is usually not present. [981]

*7.6.1.3. Clinical course, outcome, and risk stratification*
Cardiovascular involvement usually manifests as LVH, myocardial fibro-­
sis, inflammation, heart failure, and arrhythmias, which limit QoL and
are the most common cause of death. Clinical monitoring is essential
to assess disease progression and requires a multidisciplinary
approach. [980]

*7.6.2.2. Diagnosis, clinical work-up, and differential diagnosis*

The suspicion of an underlying RASopathy should be raised in infantand childhood-onset HCM with coexisting CHD [262][,][263][,][991][,][997][–][1000] or
extracardiac abnormalities (see *Table 22* ). Gene testing is recom-­
mended for diagnosis when phenotypic features are present.
Compared with sarcomeric HCM, RASopathy-associated HCM
(RAS-HCM) shows earlier age at diagnosis, [261][,][999] increased prevalence
and severity of left or biventricular obstruction, [258][,][262][,][1001] and higher
rates of early hospitalizations for heart failure or need for interventional
procedures or surgery. [258] Pulmonary stenosis is the most
commonly associated CHD, with a prevalence ranging between 25%
and 70%, and unfavourable outcomes for pulmonary valvulo-­
plasty. [256][,][1002][–][1004]

*7.6.2.3. Clinical course, management, and sudden death risk*
*stratification*
Data from the North American Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry [1005]

cohort show poorer survival rates among patients with RAS-HCM
compared with non-syndromic HCM, particularly in patients who
have been diagnosed before 1 year of age. Disease-specific risk factors
for SCD are currently an area of debate, and may include the degree of
LV hypertrophy, prolonged QTc interval, ECG risk score for HCM, [771]


*7.6.1.4. Management*
Specific treatment strategies, including enzyme replacement or
pharmacological chaperone, have limited efficacy in advanced cases
with irreversible organ damage, so early initiation appears to be import-­
ant. Enzyme replacement therapy is indicated in all symptomatic


and the HCM Risk-Kids score >6%. [81][,][826]

*7.6.2.4. Management*
Non-vasodilating beta-blockers should be titrated to maximum toler-­
ated dose in patients with RAS-HCM, particularly in cases of severe

biomarkers in such patients still requires validation. [d] Low native T1 values reinforce or generate suspicion of Fabry disease. Normal native T1 values do not
exclude Fabry disease, as they are rarely observed in untreated patients with mild LVH (mostly females), or in advanced disease due to pseudonormalization.

pathologists and always include electron microscopy studies to detect lamellar bodies and intracellular inclusions. Of note, some drugs may produce

microscopy. [982][,][983]

(RVOTO). [1012][–][1015]

**7.6.3. Friedreich ataxia**
*7.6.3.1. Definition*

Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a
homozygous GAA triplet repeat expansion in the frataxin ( *FTX* )


gene, [1016][–][1019] leading to HCM, progressive neuromuscular symptoms,
and extracardiac manifestations, including diabetes mellitus. [1016][,][1020][,][1021]

*7.6.3.2. Diagnosis, clinical work-up, and differential diagnosis*

Although several diagnostic criteria have been proposed to suspect
Friedreich ataxia, [1022][,][1023] genetic testing with identification of
bi-co-allelic GAA expansion in the first intron of the *FTX* gene or com-­
pound heterozygosis is required for diagnosis. [1024][,][1025]

Cardiovascular involvement usually manifests as hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy, with hypokinetic end-stage disease pro-­
gression and impaired perfusion reserve, [1026] leading to advanced heart
failure and death. [248][,][1005][,][1027][–][1029] There appears to be no specific rela-­
tionship between the extent of neurological involvement and cardiac

phenotype. [248][,][1005][,][1027][–][1029][,][1005][,][1027][–][1030][,][1030] Mitochondrial iron stor-­
age is the pathologic hallmark of the disease. [1031]

*7.6.3.3. Clinical course, management, and risk stratification*
Supraventricular arrhythmias, particularly AF, are commonly de-­
tected. [1027] Despite the lack of long-term follow-up longitudinal studies,
the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD seems low compared with
sarcomeric HCM. [1027][,][1032][,][1033] The Mitochondrial Protection with

Idebenone in Cardiac or Neurological Outcome (MICONOS) study
group [1034] has proposed a staging of cardiac involvement based on
LVEF and end-diastolic wall thickness. The extent of TWI at ECG,
LVEF, LV end-diastolic posterior wall thickness, fibrosis on CMR, and
hs-TnT have been proposed as negative prognostic factors. [1035]

*7.6.3.4. Management*
No specific treatment is currently available for Friedreich ataxia.
Treatment with idebenone, a coenzyme Q 10 analogue, showed the po-­
tential to improve LV mass and cardiac outcomes in open-label stud-­
ies; [1036] nevertheless, four RCTs [1037][–][1040] showed no significant
benefit on cardiac or neurologic outcomes.

**7.6.4. Glycogen storage disorders**
*7.6.4.1. Definition*
Glycogen storage disorders (GSDs) represent a heterogeneous group
of metabolic diseases, including infantile-onset Pompe disease (GSD,
type IIa), Danon disease (GSD, type IIb), and PRKAG2 disease. [272]

*7.6.4.2. Diagnosis, clinical work-up, and differential diagnosis*
Despite wide clinical heterogeneity, a presentation within the first few
months of life, hypotonia, failure to thrive, generalized muscle weak-­
ness, and severe non-obstructive HCM with concentric pattern fol-­
lowed by hypokinetic end-stage cardiomyopathy, usually within the
first year of life, are typical of GSD IIa. [259][,][268][,][1041][,][1042] Short PR interval
and increased ECG voltages may represent useful diagnostic clues for
GSDs. [1042][,][1043] PRKAG2 syndrome should be suspected in the setting

of autosomal dominant transmission and association with conduction

system disease including ventricular pre-excitation, sick sinus syn-­
drome, AF, AV block, intraventricular conduction delays or sinoatrial
blocks. [1043][–][1047] An X-linked pattern of inheritance is typical of
Danon disease (GSD IIb). Skeletal myopathy, in association with learn-­
ing disability, retinal involvement and ventricular pre-excitation, has
been detected in males affected by Danon disease, while the cardiac
phenotype can be isolated in affected females. [1048][–][1052]

*7.6.4.3. Clinical course, management, and risk stratification*
In the absence of therapeutic intervention, Pompe disease has a poor
prognosis, mainly due to end-stage heart failure. [268][,][1041] Recently, data
from a large multicentre European registry have shown that Danon dis-­
ease runs a malignant phenotype, but there are insufficient data to iden-­
tify candidate risk factors for sudden death. [1049] Sudden cardiac death
occurs in almost 10% of patients with PRKAG2 syndrome, mainly as
a consequence of advanced AV block, supraventricular tachycardia de-­
generated to VF, or massive hypertrophy. [1044][,][1053][,][1054]

*7.6.4.4. Management*

Enzyme replacement therapy is recommended in patients with GSD
IIa. [269][,][274][,][275][,][1055][,][1056] To date, there are no approved aetiological ther-­
apies for PRKAG2 syndrome and Danon disease. Heart failure therapy,


antiarrhythmic therapy, and indications for the implantation of devices

are included in *Section 6.10* .

**7.7. Amyloidosis**
It is beyond the scope of this document to provide specific recommen-­
dations for the assessment and management of cardiac amyloidosis.
Instead, the Task Force refers the reader to the 2021 position state-­
ment of the ESC Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial
Diseases on Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiac Amyloidosis. [375]

This section highlights only the key diagnostic and management issues.

**7.7.1. Definition**
Cardiac amyloidosis is characterized by the extracellular deposition of
misfolded proteins in the ventricular myocardium with the pathogno-­
monic histological property of green birefringence when viewed under
cross-polarized light after staining with Congo Red. [375]

Although once considered a rare disease, data obtained in the last
decade suggest that cardiac amyloidosis is underappreciated as a cause
of common cardiac diseases or syndromes such as HFpEF, aortic sten-­
osis, or unexplained LVH, particularly in the elderly. [1057][–][1059] Although
nine different types of cardiac amyloidosis have been described, most
cases correspond to monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain amyloid-­
osis (AL) or transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), either in its hereditary
(ATTRv) or acquired (ATTRwt) form. [375] The ATTRwt form, which
is associated with ageing, is currently considered the most frequent
form of cardiac amyloidosis worldwide.

**7.7.2. Diagnosis, clinical work-up, and differential**
**diagnosis**

Cardiac amyloidosis should be suspected in patients with increased LV
wall thickness in the presence of cardiac or extracardiac red flags and/or
in specific clinical situations, as detailed in *Figure 21*, particularly in pa-­
tients >65 years of age. [375]

Cardiac amyloidosis can be diagnosed using both invasive and noninvasive diagnostic criteria. [375] Invasive diagnostic criteria apply to all
forms of cardiac amyloidosis, whereas non-invasive criteria are ac-­
cepted only for ATTR. Invasive criteria include demonstration of amyl-­
oid fibrils within cardiac tissue or, alternatively, demonstration of
amyloid deposits in an extracardiac biopsy accompanied either by char-­
acteristic features of cardiac amyloidosis on echocardiography or
CMR. [375] Non-invasive criteria include typical echocardiographic/CMR
findings combined with planar and single-photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) grade 2 or 3 myocardial radiotracer uptake in
99m technetium-pyrophosphate ( 99m Tc-PYP) or 3,3-diphosphono-1,2propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) or hydroxymethylene diphosphonate
(HMDP) scintigraphy and exclusion of a clonal dyscrasia by all the fol-­
lowing tests: serum free light chain assay, serum and urine protein elec-­
trophoresis with immunofixation. [168] Tomographic scintigraphy should
be considered in order to reduce the number of misclassifications. [1060]

False negative scans may rarely occur in certain ATTRv genotypes; false
positives may be due to AL, recent myocardial infarction, or long-term
chloroquine use. [370] Therefore, planar and SPECT scintigraphy coupled
with assessment for monoclonal proteins followed by CMR and/or car-­
diac/extracardiac biopsy if necessary allows appropriate diagnosis in pa-­
tients with suggestive signs/symptoms, as described in *Figure 22* . [375]

However, the DPD/PYP/HMDP scan cannot distinguish between wildtype and mutated ATTR, and therefore TTR genetic testing is required.
Of note, TTR genetic testing is recommended in all transthyretin amyl-­
oid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) patients regardless of age, as 5% of

**3580** ESC Guidelines

ATTR-CM patients ≥70 years (and 10% among females) have
ATTRv. [375][,][1061]

**7.7.3. Clinical course and risk stratification**
Cardiac amyloidosis is a progressive disease with poor outcomes if left
untreated. Amyloid light chain cardiac amyloidosis is associated with
more rapid progression of heart failure and worse prognosis than
ATTR. [1058][,][1062][,][1063] Fortunately, the prognosis of AL amyloidosis has
significantly improved with the introduction of very effective therapies
capable of dramatically reducing the production of the cardiotoxic light


chains. [1064] Prognosis in ATTR depends on the variant, degree of cardiac
involvement, and neurologic phenotype. [1065][–][1068] Several multipara-­
metric biomarker-based staging systems have been developed for
AL [1069][,][1070] and ATTR cardiac amyloidosis [1066][–][1068] (see
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data) *Table S5* ).

**7.7.4. Management**

The treatment of cardiac amyloidosis includes treating and preventing
complications and stopping or delaying amyloid deposition by specific
treatment. [375][,][1071] There is no evidence to support the use of standard

ESC Guidelines **3581**

heart failure therapy, which often is not well tolerated, apart from
diuretics (see *Section 6.10.2* ). [1072][,][1073]

The natural history of cardiac amyloidosis associates electrical con-­
duction disease of the heart with symptomatic bradycardia and ad-­
vanced AV block. [375][,][1074][,][1075] The clinical threshold for pacemaker
indication should be low, as the disease progresses and implantation
of the device allows rate response to exercise and medication adjust-­
ment. [375][,][1074] The role of ICD in cardiac amyloidosis for SCD preven-­
tion is not clearly known, but available data do not support their use
in primary prevention. [1076][,][1077]

*7.7.4.1. Specific therapies*
Therapy for AL cardiac amyloidosis is based on treatment of the under-­
lying haematological problem with chemotherapy or autologous stemcell transplant. [1064]

Transthyretin stabilization and reduction of its production are the
basis of TTR cardiac amyloidosis treatment. Tafamidis reduced all-cause


mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations in ATTR, with the largest
effect achieved in patients at NYHA functional class I and II. [1078]

Additional studies are being conducted with other stabilizing agents
and other molecules that reduce TTR production. [1078a]
### **8. Other recommendations**

**8.1. Sports**
**8.1.1. Cardiovascular benefits of exercise**
Regular physical activity and systematic exercise confer several cardio-­
vascular, psychological, and QoL benefits. Through curbing risk factors
for atherosclerosis, such as obesity and insulin resistance, [1079] hyperten-­
sion, [1080] and hyperlipidaemia, [1081] regular physical activity is associated
with an up to 50% risk reduction in an adverse event from CAD in
middle-aged and older individuals. [1082][,][1083] Individuals who exercise
regularly live 5–7 years longer than their sedentary counterparts, [1084]

**3582** ESC Guidelines


and have a lower risk of cerebrovascular accidents [1085] and certain ma-­
lignancies. [1085][–][1087] These benefits that can be derived later in life also
apply to individuals with established cardiovascular disease. For a defin-­
ition of exercise intensity levels, please refer to [Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data)
online, *[Table S6](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data)* .

**8.1.2. Exercise-related sudden cardiac death and**

**historical exercise recommendations for patients**
**with cardiomyopathy**
Rigorous exercise may trigger myocardial infarction and fatal arrhyth-­
mias among individuals with an underlying cardiovascular disease. [1088][– ]

1091 Superimposed on the pathological substrate of the disease entity
itself, exercise may induce sudden cardiac arrest through mechanical
shearing forces within the coronary arteries, effects of high concentra-­
tions of circulating catecholamines, increased cardiac loading condi-­
tions, raised core temperature, electrolyte shifts, and acid-base

disturbance.

Cardiomyopathies are the leading cause of exercise-related SCD in
young people in the Western world. [40][,][1092][–][1095] The established link be-­
tween exercise and SCD from cardiomyopathy, and the finding that, in
some cardiomyopathy phenotypes, exercise may accelerate progres-­
sion of the underlying cardiomyopathic disease process, has historically
resulted in restrictive exercise recommendations in all affected patients
regardless of pathology, disease severity, symptomatic status, general
risk profile, or prior therapeutic interventions, including an ICD. [1096][– ]

1098 As a result, individuals with cardiomyopathy often confine them-­
selves to a relatively sedentary lifestyle through fear of potential SCD
and accrue risk factors for atherosclerotic CAD, which confer a worse
prognosis. [1099][–][1102][,][1096][,][1097]

**8.1.3. Exercise recommendations in hypertrophic**
**cardiomyopathy**
Recent pre-clinical [1103] and clinical data suggest that moderate exercise
may be beneficial and safe in patients with HCM. [1098][–][1102] Information
on a safe dose of vigorous exercise is still limited, but the heteroge-­
neous morphology and pathophysiology of HCM means that some in-­
dividuals are capable of participating in vigorous exercise, including
high-intensity competitive sports. [760] Most athletes capable of exercis-­
ing intensively have mild LV hypertrophy, normal-sized or enlarged
LV, normal diastolic function, and no evidence of LVOTO. [1104][,][1105]

Currently available data indicate that participation in vigorous exercise
and competitive sport may be considered in a select group of predom-­
inantly adult patients who have mild morphology and a low-risk pro-­
file. [1106][–][1108] However, studies examining the effect of vigorous
exercise or moderate-to-high-intensity competitive sport on the nat-­
ural history of HCM were not designed or powered adequately to ad-­
dress the question and there are potential issues of selection bias.
Nevertheless, based on emerging evidence, the Task Force agreed to
adopt a comparatively liberal approach, advocating that, after appropri-­
ate selection, some individuals with a low-risk profile may participate in
high-intensity exercise and competitive sport after comprehensive ex-­
pert evaluation and shared discussion, which highlights the unpredict-­
able nature of exercise-related SCD in HCM. Sporting disciplines in
which syncope may result in fatal accidental injury or danger to others

are not recommended.

Genotype-positive/phenotype-negative patients may engage in all
competitive sport; however, annual assessment is recommended to
check for developing phenotypic features of disease. [1109]


**8.1.4. Exercise recommendations in arrhythmogenic**
**right ventricular cardiomyopathy**

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a recognized cause of
exercise-related SCD in young asymptomatic individuals, [40][,][890] postulated
to result from ventricular stretch leading to myocyte detachment with
subsequent inflammation and fibro-fatty replacement of the ventricular
myocardium. Fatal arrhythmias may occur during the inflammatory pro-­
cess or because of myocardial scar. In addition, there are data to suggest
that high-intensity exercise is associated with acceleration of disease
phenotype in individuals with ARVC, including those who are genotype
positive/phenotype negative, and particularly those with *PKP2* var-­
iants. [181][,][1110][–][1114] Furthermore, exercise restriction has been shown to
improve clinical outcomes in patients with ARVC. [40][,][1111][,][1115][–][1117] Based
on these data, the Task Force recommends against intensive exercise
or competitive sports in individuals with ARVC as part of a shared
decision-making process. The evidence on the impact of exercise in
genotype-positive/phenotype-negative individuals is more limited. In these
cases, the Task Force recommends a cautious approach in the context of
shared decision-making when discussing competitive sports participation.
Mild-to-moderate physical activity for up to 150 min per week is consid-­
ered safe and is recommended in able phenotype-negative individuals. [1118]

**8.1.5. Exercise recommendations in dilated**

**cardiomyopathy and non-dilated left ventricular**
**cardiomyopathy**

There is evidence that moderate exercise in optimally treated patients
with DCM improves functional capacity, ventricular function, and
QoL; [1119] however, intensive exercise and competitive sports may
also trigger fatal arrhythmias in DCM and NDLVC. [1093][,][1120][–][1122]

In general, symptomatic individuals with DCM and NDLVC should
abstain from most competitive and leisure sports, or recreational exer-­
cise associated with moderate or high exercise intensity. A select group
of asymptomatic individuals with DCM and NDLVC who have mildly
impaired LV function without exercise-induced arrhythmias or signifi-­
cant myocardial fibrosis may participate in most competitive sports.

Although the natural history of most pathogenic variants capable of
causing DCM and NDLVC is unknown, it would be reasonable to permit
intensive exercise and competitive sports in most individuals with patho-­
genic variants in the absence of overt features of DCM or NDLVC.
Special consideration, however, should be given to individuals with
pathogenic variants in genes that are associated with an increased risk
of life-threatening arrhythmias, such as lamin A/C [181][,][1123] or *TMEM43*
variants, for which there is emerging evidence that exercise may have
an adverse effect on cardiac function and risk of potentially fatal arrhyth-­
mias. The impact of vigorous exercise in patients with pathogenic variants
in other high-risk genes, such as filamin C variants [1112] exhibiting DCM or
NDLVC phenotypes, is not fully understood; however, extrapolating our
understanding of the effect of exercise on some ARVC and DCM phe-­
notypes necessitates a cautious approach.

**8.2. Reproductive issues**
Pregnancy and the post-partum period constitute periods of increased
risk of cardiovascular complications in women with cardiomyop-­
athy. [1127][–][1130] Cardiomyopathy can also be first diagnosed in pregnancy
or arise during pregnancy as PPCM. [1131]

The risk associated with pregnancy in a patient with a cardiomyop-­
athy is estimated using the modified World Health Organization
(mWHO) classification. [1130] Pregnancy is contraindicated in women
with WHO class IV, including patients with EF <30% or NYHA
class III–IV or previous PPCM with persisting impairment of the LV

function.

**8.2.1. Contraception,** ***in vitro*** **fertilization, and**
**hormonal treatment**

Counselling on safe and effective contraception is indicated in all wo-­
men of fertile age. Ethinyloestradiol-containing contraceptives have
the greatest risk of thrombosis [1132] and are not advised in women
with a high risk of thrombo-embolic disease. Progestin-only contracep-­
tives are an alternative, as they have little or no effect on coagulation
factors, blood pressure, and lipid levels. Levonorgestrel-based longacting reversible contraception implants or intrauterine devices are
the safest and most effective contraceptives and have few side effects
affecting cardiomyopathies.

Medically assisted procreation adds risks beyond those of pregnancy
alone; superovulation is pro-thrombotic and can be complicated by
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, with marked fluid shifts and an
even greater risk of thrombosis. Hormonal stimulation should be care-­
fully considered in women who have WHO class III disease (VT or
HCM) or who are anticoagulated.

**8.2.2. Pregnancy management**
*8.2.2.1. Pre-pregnancy*
Patients with a known cardiomyopathy and at risk of developing cardio-­
myopathy should receive pre-pregnancy counselling by a multidisciplin-­
ary team: the pregnancy heart team. The individual risk of the woman
by pregnancy should be discussed using the WHO classification, in add-­
ition to discussing the likelihood of transmission of the disease to the
offspring and how to reduce the transgenerational risk of transmitting

the disorder.

For individual risk estimation, at a minimum, an ECG, echocardiog-­
raphy, and exercise test should be performed. Several aspects must
be discussed with the woman, including long-term prognosis, drug ther-­
apy, estimated maternal risk and outcome, and plans for pregnancy care
and delivery.

*8.2.2.2. Pregnancy*

In women with mWHO class II–III, III, and IV (including women with
HCM, VTs, and EF <35%), management during pregnancy and around
delivery should be conducted in an expert centre by a multidisciplinary
team: the pregnancy heart team, including cardiologists with expertise
in cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias; obstetricians; and anaesthetists.
Depending on the individual case, other specialists may be included
(geneticist, cardio-thoracic surgeon, paediatric cardiologist, foetal medi-­
cine specialist, neonatologist, etc.). A delivery plan should be created
that includes the details of induction; the management of labour and de-­
livery; and post-partum surveillance.

**3584** ESC Guidelines


*8.2.2.3. Timing and mode of delivery*

The timing and mode of delivery should be personalized according to
the type of cardiomyopathy, ventricular function, NYHA class, arrhyth-­
mic risk, and thrombo-embolic risk. Vaginal delivery is associated with
less blood loss and lower risk of infection, venous thrombosis, and em-­
bolism than caesarean section and should be advised for most women.

Caesarean section should be considered for obstetric indications, pa-­
tients with severe outflow tract obstruction, or in cases of severe
acute/intractable heart failure, or in cases at high risk of threatening ar-­
rhythmia and for patients presenting in labour on oral anticoagu-­
lants. [1130] During delivery, patients with cardiomyopathy should be
circulatory and heart rhythm monitored on an individualized basis.

*8.2.2.4. Post-partum*
The post-partum period is associated with significant haemodynamic
changes and fluid shifts, particularly in the first 24–48 h after delivery,
which may precipitate heart failure. Haemodynamic monitoring should
therefore be continued for at least 24–48 h in patients at risk. Most
drugs enter the milk and could thus contraindicate breastfeeding (see
*Section 8.2.2.5* ).

*8.2.2.5. Pharmacological treatment: general aspects*

Pharmacological treatment in pregnant women should be the same as
in non-pregnant patients, with an avoidance of drugs contraindicated in
pregnancy, such as ACE-Is, ARBs, and renin inhibitors. [1130] The first tri-­
mester is associated with the greatest teratogenic risk. Pharmacologic
therapy is advised to begin as late as possible in pregnancy and at the
lowest effective dose. Drug exposure later in pregnancy may confer ad-­
verse effects on foetal growth and development. It is recommended to
check drug and safety data before initiation of a new drug in pregnancy;
see Table 7 in the *2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovas-­*
*cular diseases during pregnancy* . [1130] From this list, antiarrhythmics can be

summarized as follows:

- Well tolerated: sotalol, oral verapamil.

- While the benefits and risks should be evaluated in each case, the fol-­

lowing drugs can often be continued if there is a clear indication for
use during pregnancy: bisoprolol, carvedilol, digoxin, diltiazem (pos-­
sible teratogenic effects), disopyramide (uterine contractions), flecai-­
nide, lidocaine, metoprolol, nadolol, propranolol, verapamil,
quinidine.

- Insufficient data: ivabradine, mexiletine, propafenone, vernakalant.

- Contraindicated: amiodarone, atenolol, dronedarone, ACE-Is, ARBs,
renin inhibitors, and spironolactone. [1130]

Ongoing beta-blocker treatment in cardiomyopathies should be con-­
tinued during pregnancy, with close monitoring of foetal growth. After
delivery, it is advised to heart rhythm monitor the infant for 48 h. The
use of beta-blockers and anticoagulation during pregnancy is described
in the *2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases*
*during pregnancy* . [1130]

Vitamin K antagonist use in the first trimester results in embryopathy
(limb defects, nasal hypoplasia) in 0.6–10% of cases. [1133][,][1134] In contrast,
unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low-molecular-weight heparin
(LMWH) do not cross the placenta; therefore, substitution of VKA
with UFH or LMWH in weeks 6–12 almost eliminates the risk of em-­
bryopathy. This risk is also dose dependent (0.45–0.9% with low-dose
warfarin). Vaginal delivery while the mother is on VKAs is


contraindicated because of the risk of foetal intracranial bleeding.
Haemorrhagic complications in the mother occur with all regimens,
but the incidence is lower with VKA than with LMWH/UFH through-­
out pregnancy. [1130]

VKA should be continued until pregnancy is achieved. Continuation
of VKAs throughout pregnancy should be considered when the dose is
low (see Table 7 in the *2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of car-­*
*diovascular diseases during pregnancy* [1130] ). The target international nor-­
malized ratio (INR) should be chosen according to current guidelines,
with INR monitoring weekly or every 2 weeks. Self-monitoring of
INR in suitable patients is recommended. Alternatively, depending on
the indication, a switch to LMWH from weeks 6–12 under strict mon-­
itoring may be considered in patients with a low dose requirement.
When a higher dose of VKAs is required, discontinuation of VKAs be-­
tween weeks 6 and 12 and replacement with adjusted-dose i.v. UFH or
LMWH twice daily with dose adjustment according to peak anti-Xa (for
LMWH) levels should be considered.

In case of delivery in anticoagulated women (not including mechan-­
ical valves) with a planned caesarean section, therapeutic LMWH dosing
can be simply omitted for 24 h prior to surgery. If delivery has to be
performed earlier, anti-Xa activity can guide the timing of the
procedure.

*Antiarrhythmic therapy in pregnancy other than medication.*
Implantation of an ICD and catheter ablation should ideally be consid-­
ered prior to pregnancy in patients with a high risk of ventricular ar-­
rhythmias to avoid implantations and interventions during
pregnancy. [1135] If an ICD is indicated in pregnancy, ICD implantation
should be performed beyond 8 weeks of gestation with radiation pro-­
tection [1136] and the indication should be weighed against the limited ex-­
perience available. In pregnant patients with existing ICD, routine ICD
interrogation and advice are recommended prior to delivery.

*8.2.2.6. Specific cardiomyopathies*
Most women with HCM tolerate pregnancy well. [1137] Complications
during pregnancy most often occur in women who have symptoms, ar-­
rhythmias, or impaired LV function before pregnancy. Left ventricular
outflow tract gradients may increase slightly during pregnancy and
high gradients before pregnancy are associated with more complica-­
tions. [1137] Women should be assessed according to WHO risk class, in-­
dicating at trimester for low-risk patients (class II) and monthly or
bi-monthly for higher-risk patients (class III). Therapeutic anticoagula-­
tion with LMWH or VKAs according to the stage of pregnancy is re-­
commended for patients with AF. Cardioversion in pregnancy should
be considered for poorly tolerated persistent AF. Hypovolaemia is
poorly tolerated. Caesarean section should be considered in patients
with severe LVOTO, pre-term labour while on oral anticoagulants,
or severe heart failure. [1130] Epidural and spinal anaesthesia must be ap-­
plied cautiously, especially with severe LVOTO, due to potential hypo-­
volaemia, and single-shot spinal anaesthesia should be avoided.

Pregnancy in ARVC seems to be relatively tolerable, as shown in sev-­
eral studies, with no excess mortality and no clear negative long-term
outcome. [1138][–][1141] Previous VTs represent a WHO risk class III, indicat-­
ing bi-monthly or monthly follow-up at an expert centre.

Women with DCM are at risk of further deterioration of LV function

in pregnancy. Data suggest that pregnancy might not be associated with
long-term adverse disease progression or event-free survival in LMNA
genotype-positive women. [1142] Predictors of maternal mortality are
NYHA class III/IV and EF <40%. Highly adverse risk factors include

ESC Guidelines **3585**


EF <20%, severe mitral regurgitation, RV failure, AF, and/or
hypotension. [1143]

*8.2.2.7. Peripartum cardiomyopathy*

Genetic studies in patients with PPCM have revealed genetic similarity
between PPCM and DCM. Specifically, an overrepresentation of trun-­
cating variants has been demonstrated in *TTN*, *FLNC*, *BAG3*, and *DSP*,
with *TTN* truncating variants most commonly involved (found in
∼10% of patients). [44][,][45] It has been suggested that approaches to genetic
testing in PPCM should mirror those taken in DCM. [45] Medications used
to treat heart failure during pregnancy require special considerations as
discussed above. In the presence of persistant cardiac dysfunction,
medication should be continued. Use of bromocriptine as diseasespecific therapy in patients with PPCM as an addition to standard heart
failure therapy has shown promising results in two clinical trials. [1144][,][1145]

In severe cases of PPCM, temporary MCS has been used successfully
and should be considered in patients with haemodynamic instability
despite inotropic support. [1146] In patients with PPCM, thresholds for
early ICD implantations should be higher than in other conditions be-­
cause of a high rate of spontaneous recovery after delivery. [1147]

Recommendation Table 32 **— Recommendations for**
**reproductive issues in patients with cardiomyopathy**


**8.3. Recommendations for non-cardiac**

**surgery**
Cardiomyopathies, in general, are associated with an increased inci-­
dence of peri-operative heart failure and arrhythmias, although the sig-­
nificant variability in the phenotypic expression of cardiomyopathies
must be considered. Special attention should be given to the clinical sta-­
tus, LVEF, volume overload, and increased levels of natriuretic peptides.
In the period after non-cardiac surgery (NCS), fluids given during the
operation may be mobilized, causing hypervolaemia and pulmonary
congestion. Careful attention to fluid balance is therefore essen-­
tial. [1148][,][1149] Obstructive HCM deserves specific consideration due to
its peculiar pathophysiology, with adequate intra-operative vigilance,
avoiding factors and medication that may increase LVOTO and prompt
pharmacological treatment and intravascular fluid therapy if needed
[(see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data) *Table S7* ). [1150][,][1151]

Natriuretic peptide concentrations are quantitative plasma biomar-­
kers for the presence and severity of haemodynamic cardiac stress
and heart failure, and elevated NT-proBNP concentrations may facili-­
tate detection of heart failure, optimal intra-operative monitoring,
and initiation or optimization of heart failure therapy after surgery. [1152]

Moreover, in cardiomyopathy patients elevated NT-proBNP values are
strong predictors of overall prognosis. [1153][–][1156]

Patients with a first-degree relative with a genetic cardiomyopathy
should be evaluated with an ECG and an echocardiographic examination
to rule out the presence of the disease, irrespective of age (see *Section*
*6.11* ). There are no specific data on risks of NCS in phenotype-negative
family members; however, they are at risk of developing the disease, which
may be subclinical at the time of the NCS. [1157] Data in children with HCM
undergoing general anaesthesia for cardiac and non-cardiac procedures
show that, in a specialist setting with multidisciplinary involvement, perioperative morbidity and mortality are extremely low. [1158]

### **9. Requirements for specialized ** **cardiomyopathy units**

As genomic tests and information are incorporated into strategies for
the routine diagnosis and management of cardiomyopathies and the es-­
timation of disease risk, cardiologists need to familiarize themselves
with the general principles underlying the interpretation of test results
and must be able to convey the implications to patients. They also need
to be able to make informed judgments about which tests are appropri-­
ate for different patients and clinical situations. The risk of SCD and the
possibility that family members could inherit the condition makes multi-­
disciplinary expertise, including genetic counselling, psychological care,
and patient support associations, a critical aspect of care. [1166] As a re-­
sult, there is a growing need for clinicians to develop their understand-­
ing of the basic principles of clinical genetics and the diverse clinical
manifestations of individual genetic disorders. [54][,][964][,][1166][,][1167]

Cardiomyopathies have a highly heterogeneous clinical presentation
and an evolution that sometimes is difficult to predict. Disease phenotype
can be the result of various acquired factors or genetic backgrounds.
Mixed phenotypes or two conditions within the same patient or among
a family can coexist. Genetic diagnosis raises common logistical and eth-­
ical problems in its execution, as well as in the interpretation and com-­
munication of the results. [1166] Diagnostic process, the management of
symptoms, and risk stratification often require comprehensive evaluation
of the patient and their family, with the participation of multidisciplinary
teams. On the other hand, interventional procedures (septal ablation,
myectomies, etc.) require an expertise that only centres that treat
many patients can achieve. Specialization in this area also requires per-­
manent updating to accurately characterize the disease prognosis, ensure
the choice of the best therapeutic option in each case, and guarantee the
implementation of that choice by a team with experience in the field.

These characteristics imply that the adequate management of these
diseases requires specific tools, extensive experience, and a multidiscip-­
linary basic-clinical approach that are difficult to achieve.

The cardiomyopathy unit is usually integrated into a general cardioge-­
netic (or inherited cardiac conditions) unit, where other professionals in-­
volved in hereditary cardiac and vascular conditions, such as
channelopathies, genetic aortopathies, familial dyslipidaemias, and a num-­
ber of genetic metabolic and syndromic diseases with cardiac involve-­
ment, are co-ordinated. They represent an organizational model aimed
at providing comprehensive cardiovascular and genetic assessment and
personalized management in patients with inherited cardiovascular dis-­
eases. Specialized multidisciplinary clinics have long been advocated as
the ideal model for the management of patients and families with inher-­
ited cardiac conditions. [4][,][53][,][559][,][1166] Such a model of care supports the hol-­
istic care of patients and their at-risk family members, taking a
patient-centred approach and valuing clinical, genetic, and psychosocial
outcomes. The benefit of a specialized clinic for management of HCM
has been previously reported, with patients showing better adjustment
and less worry than those who did not attend. [53][,][224] Besides expertise
in the field of inherited cardiac conditions, the presence of a multidiscip-­
linary team, access to good technical resources, participation in dedicated
research projects, availability of genetic counselling, and family screening
are all pre-requisites for organizing a cardiogenetic clinic. The ability to
provide education and training for medical professionals and collabor-­
ation with patients’ associations is of utmost importance.

[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data) *Table S8* synthesizes the requirements
and skills and recommendations for professional education/training
needed for a cardiogenetic clinic as proposed by international expert

associations.

### **10. Living with cardiomyopathy: ** **advice for patients**

Most people with cardiomyopathy lead normal and productive
lives, but a small number experience significant symptoms and are at
risk of disease-related complications. Regardless of the severity of their
disease, it is important that individuals receive support and accurate
advice from cardiomyopathy specialists and other healthcare
professionals, and that they are encouraged to understand and
manage the disease themselves (see the [Supplemental Data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data)
*[Table S9](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194#supplementary-data)*, for a description of the patient education process).

Table 24 **General guidance for daily activity for pa-­**
**tients with cardiomyopathies**


|Topic|General guidance|
|---|---|
|Exercise|• See earlier section on exercise<br>recommendations.|
|Diet, alcohol use, and<br>weight|• Patients should be encouraged to maintain a<br>recommended body mass index.<br>• Avoid dehydration, excess alcohol intake, and<br>drugs consumption.|
|Smoking|• There are no data that show an interaction<br>between tobacco smoking and<br>cardiomyopathy, but patients should be<br>provided with general advice on the health risks<br>associated with smoking, including<br>pro-arrhythmic and pro-inflammatory effects<br>and, when available, information on smoking<br>cessation.1168–1171|
|Reproductive issues|• Patients should be given the opportunity to<br>discuss their concerns about reproductive<br>issues. Anxiety and depression following a<br>diagnosis are frequent, and some patients may<br>express guilt or fear about their genetic<br>diagnosis and the risk of transmission to<br>offspring.|
|Sexual activity|• Patients should be counselled on the potential<br>effect of their medication on sexual<br>performance.<br>• Most people with cardiomyopathy will be able<br>to undertake normal sexual activity.<br>Individualized advice should be provided<br>regarding its safety and the possible impact of<br>sexual activity on the risk of disease<br>progression, ventricular arrhythmias, and/or<br>ICD shocks.|
|Medication|• Patients should be provided with information<br>about their medication, including potential side<br>and teratogenic effects and interactions with<br>prescribed medications, over-the-counter<br>remedies, and other complementary therapies.|
|Vaccination|• In the absence of contraindications, patients<br>should be advised to have regular<br>recommended vaccinations (e.g. yearly<br>influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination).|

ESC Guidelines **3587**








|Driving|• Most patients should be eligible for an ordinary<br>driving licence and can continue driving unless<br>they experience distracting or disabling<br>symptoms.<br>• Advice on driving licences for heavy goods or<br>passenger-carrying vehicles should be in line<br>with local legislation.<br>• For further information on driving with ICDs,<br>see local rules.|
|---|---|
|Occupation|• Most people with cardiomyopathy will be able<br>to accomplish their normal jobs. The<br>implications of heavily manual jobs that involve<br>strenuous activity should be discussed with the<br>appropriate specialist.<br>• For some occupations, such as pilots, military<br>personnel, and emergency services personnel,<br>there are strict guidelines or rules on eligibility.<br>• The social and financial implications of a<br>diagnosis of cardiomyopathy should be included<br>in the counselling of relatives before clinical or<br>genetic screening.|
|Holidays and travel<br>insurance|• Most asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic<br>patients can fly safely. For further information<br>on fyl ing with ICD, see ‘Fitness to fly for<br>passengers with cardiovascular disease’.1172<br>• Insurance companies may charge more for<br>travel insurance. In some countries, patient<br>support organizations can provide advice about<br>obtaining reasonable insurance.|
|Life insurance|• The diagnosis of cardiomyopathy will result in<br>difficulty obtaining life insurance or mortgages.<br>Advice on the rules that apply in different<br>countries should be provided to patients at<br>diagnosis.|
|Pregnancy and<br>childbirth|See Section 8.2|
|Education/schooling|• Teachers and other carers should be provided<br>with advice and written information relevant to<br>the care of children with cardiomyopathy.<br>• In the absence of symptoms and risk factors,<br>children should be allowed to perform low- to<br>moderate-level aerobic physical activity, in<br>accordance with advice from their paediatric<br>cardiologist. Advice on high-intensity exercise in<br>children should be guided by cardiomyopathy<br>phenotype and the presence of symptoms and<br>risk factors within a specialist paediatric<br>cardiomyopathy setting.<br>• Provision should be made for children with<br>learning difficulties and other special needs.<br>• Parents, teachers, and staff at sports facilities<br>should be trained in CPR and in the use of<br>AEDs.|

*Table 24* summarizes some of the key issues that should be discussed
with patients, relatives, and carers. When appropriate (e.g. when con-­
sidering pregnancy, see *Section 8.2* ), patients should be referred to
other specialist services.
### **11. Sex differences in ** **cardiomyopathies**

Sex differences in phenotypic expression and outcomes are well docu-­
mented across cardiovascular medicine. Differences in clinical presenta-­
tion, progression, and outcome in cardiomyopathies between females
and males can be attributable to genetic and hormonal differences,
but also to variations in management, access to healthcare, or response
to specific therapies. [546][,][1173] Eliminating these variations represents a
major unmet need in the care of cardiomyopathies.

Cardiomyopathies are typically inherited as an autosomal dominant
trait. Therefore, the prevalence would be expected to be equal among
the sexes. Women are consistently less represented than men in clinical
studies across different cardiomyopathies (30–40%). Despite this, the
difference may be explained by bias in interaction with healthcare facil-­
ities or by diagnosis criteria based on unadjusted cardiac imaging mea-­
surements; data from large pedigrees seem to support the hypothesis
that there is a real delay in the age of phenotypic expression in female
carriers (at least for HCM). [178][,][1174][–][1176]

Females with HCM are diagnosed later than males (8–13 years later),
are more severely affected, more often have LVOTO, have more severe
symptoms at baseline, and more commonly develop advanced heart failure
during follow-up. [1177][,][1178] Women with LVOTO and indication for invasive
procedures are often older and more symptomatic than males. [1179][–][1181]

Females and males appear to show similar survival benefit from invasive
SRT. [705][,][1181] Cardiomyopathy-related death has shown to be increased
in middle-aged females with HCM compared with men and the general
population; this is due to a higher rate of death from heart failure. No dif-­
ference in SCD has been demonstrated in HCM regarding sex. [1182][,][1183]

Females with DCM may have a better response to therapy and seem
to have a more favourable clinical course than males. [186][,][1184] Male sex

has been reported to be consistently associated with an increased
SCD rate in DCM (general cohorts and particular genotypes ser-­
ies), [186][,][541][,][872][,][878][,][1185][–][1187] and death from heart failure or transplant
in general DCM cohorts. [1188][,][1189]

Male sex and sports have been traditionally identified as variables as-­
sociated with an earlier phenotypic penetrance and a more severe dis-­
ease expression in genetic carriers, and are independent predictors of
malignant ventricular arrhythmic events in ARVC. [522][,][950][,][1190][–][1195] As in
HCM, females with ARVC may have an increased risk of developing
heart failure. [1193]

Reports on sex differences in familial or genetic RCM are
scarce. [331][,][546] Compared with other types of cardiomyopathies, females
seem to be as equally represented as males in RCM series. [331]
### **12. Comorbidities and ** **cardiovascular risk factors in ** **cardiomyopathies**

**12.1. Cardiovascular risk factors**

The penetrance of the disease in genetic carriers of

**3588** ESC Guidelines


interactions can explain part of the heterogeneity of the phenotypic
expression of all cardiomyopathy phenotypes, although published
data focus primarily on HCM, DCM, and ARVC.

**12.2. Dilated cardiomyopathy**
Individual genetic predisposition favours a dilated phenotype in the
presence of trigger factors, such as inflammation, infection, toxic insults
from alcohol or drugs, and tachyarrhythmias.

**12.3. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**
Hypertension and obesity have been associated with penetrance and
phenotypic expression of HCM. [1196] Results from the EORP
Cardiomyopathy/Mycarditis Registry showed that patients with HCM
had a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, comparable with
data from the general population. [1196] Hypertension, diabetes, and
obesity were associated with older age at presentation, a lower preva-­
lence of family history of HCM and SCD, more symptoms, frequent AF,
and worse LV diastolic function. [1197] Hypertension and obesity were
also associated with higher provocable LVOT gradients and LVH. [1198]

**12.4. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular**
**cardiomyopathy**
The role of intense exercise in disease expression and outcomes has
been studied in HCM and DCM, but the impact has shown to be par-­
ticularly relevant in ARVC ( *Table 25* ). Despite significant research, the
pathophysiology of ARVC is complex and not well understood. The
search for genetic or environmental triggers, such as viruses and im-­
mune response, has failed to identify actionable factors. The role of in-­
flammation on the pathophysiology is thought to be key. [1199]

### **13. Coronavirus disease ** **(COVID-19) and cardiomyopathies**

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infec-­
tion, known as COVID-19, is characterized by a high variability of clin-­
ical presentation and outcomes with an adverse association between
underlying cardiac disease, including heart failure, and
SARS-CoV-2-related mortality. [1200][–][1202] However, examination of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in underlying causes of heart failure, particularly
cardiomyopathies, has been limited.

Analyses of international registries on cardiomyopathies and
SARS-CoV-2 from the pre-vaccine period have identified several mar-­
kers of adverse outcomes. [1203] Prior history of heart failure and particu-­
lar phenotypes (amyloidosis and DCM) were significantly associated
with intensive care unit admission and death compared with HCM,
ARVC, and the general population. For HCM, age, baseline functional
class, LVOTO, and systolic impairment were independent predictors
of death. [1204]

SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been demonstrated to be safe in large
population studies and reports on complications related to the vaccin-­
ation in patients with cardiomyopathy are anecdotal. Given this, and the
potential for worse outcomes in cardiomyopathy patients who con-­
tract COVID-19, vaccination is encouraged in all cardiomyopathy pa-­
tients and, in particular, in those with signs or symptoms of heart failure.
### **14. Key messages**

(1) Cardiomyopathies are more common than previously thought
and they typically require nuanced management that may differ
from the conventional approach to patients with arrhythmia or

heart failure.

(2) Aetiology is fundamental to the management of patients with
heart muscle disease and careful and systematic description of
the morphological and functional phenotype is a crucial first
step in the diagnostic pathway.
(3) An approach to nomenclature and diagnosis of cardiomyopathies
that is based on the predominant phenotype at presentation is

recommended.

(4) Patients with cardiomyopathy may seek medical attention due to
symptoms onset (HF or arrhythmia related), incidental abnormal
findings, or as a result of family screening following the diagnosis in
a relative.

(5) Multimodality imaging to characterize the cardiac phenotype
(morphology and function)—including tissue characterization
for non-ischaemic myocardial scar detection—is necessary,
in combination with a detailed personal and family history,
clinical examination, electrocardiography, and laboratory
investigations.
(6) Imaging results should always be interpreted in the overall clinical
context, including genetic testing results, rather than in isolation.
(7) Tissue characterization by CMR is of value in diagnosis, monitor-­

ing of disease progression and risk stratification in each of the
main cardiomyopathy phenotypes.
(8) DPD/PYP/HMDP bone-tracer scintigraphy or SPECT represent
the gold standard for the diagnosis of ATTR-related cardiac
amyloidosis.
(9) The presence of non-ischaemic ventricular scar or fatty replace-­

ment on cardiac CMR and/or pathological examination, which
can occur with or without ventricular dilatation and/or systolic
dysfunction, can be the sole clue to the diagnosis of a cardiomy-­
opathy and can have prognostic significance that varies with
aetiology.
(10) The aim of this multiparametric and systemic approach is to gen-­

erate a phenotype-based aetiological diagnosis, interpreting avail-­
able data with a cardiomyopathy-oriented mindset that combines
cardiological assessment with non-cardiac parameters.
(11) A multidisciplinary approach to patient care and appropriate tran-­

sition of care from paediatric to adult cardiomyopathy services is

needed.

(12) Genetic testing should be performed in patients with cardiomy-­

opathy and may influence risk stratification and management.
(13) Genetic counselling, including pre- and post-test counselling, and
psychological support are an essential aspect of the multidisciplin-­
ary care of patients with cardiomyopathy and their relatives.
(14) Paediatric cardiomyopathies largely represent part of the same
clinical spectrum as those seen in older adolescents and adults,
but infant-onset (in the first year of life) cardiomyopathies are of-­
ten associated with severe phenotypes and a high rate of heart
failure-related morbidity and mortality.
(15) Beyond the first year of life, genetic causes of childhood-onset
cardiomyopathies are similar to those in adults.
(16) Symptom management, identification, and prevention of
disease-related complications (including SCD, heart failure, and
stroke) are the cornerstone of management of all
cardiomyopathies.
(17) Cardiac myosin inhibitors (Mavacamten) should be considered in
patients with HCM and LVOTO who remain symptomatic des-­
pite optimal medical therapy.
(18) Validated SCD risk-prediction tools (HCM Risk-SCD and HCM
Risk-Kids) are the first step in sudden death prevention in patients
with HCM.

(19) Additional risk markers may be of use in patients with low or
intermediate risk, but there is a lack of robust data on the impact
of these parameters on the personalized risk estimates generated
by the risk-prediction tools.
(20) Pharmacological treatment of DCM patients does not differ from

those recommended in chronic heart failure.

(21) SCD risk of DCM and NDLVC patients varies depending on the
underlying cause and genetic subtype.
(22) CMR findings play an important role in guiding ICD implantation
for patients with DCM and NDLVC.


(23) In DCM and NDLVC patients, ICD should be considered for cer-­

tain genetic forms even if LVEF is >35%.
(24) It is of importance to define aetiology for a tailored management
in patients with syndromic and metabolic cardiomyopathies (i.e.
ERT/chaperone in lysosomal storage disease; tafamidis in
ATTRwt, etc.).
(25) Pregnancy and the post-partum period are associated with in-­

creased cardiovascular risk in women with known cardiomyopathy.
(26) A multidisciplinary team should evaluate the patient with cardio-­

myopathy to assess the risk associated with pregnancy.
(27) Beta-blocker therapy on arrhythmic indication can safely be con-­

tinued during pregnancy; safety data should be checked before ini-­
tiation of new drugs in pregnancy.
(28) Healthy adults of all ages and individuals with known cardiac dis-­

ease should exercise with moderate intensity, totalling at least
150 min per week.
(29) All patients with cardiomyopathy should have an individualized
risk assessment for exercise prescription. Evaluation should be
guided by three principles: (i) preventing life-threatening arrhyth-­
mias during exercise; (ii) symptom management to allow sports;
and (iii) preventing sports-induced progression of the arrhythmo-­
genic condition.
(30) Individuals who are genotype positive/phenotype negative or have
a mild cardiomyopathy phenotype and absence of symptoms or
any risk factors, may be able to participate in competitive sports.
In some high-risk patients with HCM, ARVC, and NDLVC, highintensity exercise and competitive sports should be discouraged.
(31) Patients with high-risk genotypes or associated factors for ar-­

rhythmic or heart failure complications or severe LVOTO should
be referred for specialized investigations before undergoing elect-­
ive NCS.

(32) Identification and management of risk factors and concomitant
diseases is recommended as an integral part of the management
of cardiomyopathy patients.
### **15. Gaps in evidence**

Although there have been major advances in the genetics, diagnosis, and
treatments of patients with cardiomyopathy over the last few years,
there are a number of areas where robust evidence is still lacking and

deserve to be addressed in future clinical research.

(1) Cardiomyopathy phenotypes.
(2) Epidemiology:

(a) Prevalence of NDLVC phenotype (children and adults).
(b) Systematic assessment of prevalence of cardiomyopathy phe-­

notypes in childhood.
(3) Integrated patient management:

(a) Embedding of telemedicine into cardiomyopathy networks.
(4) Patient pathway:

(a) Laboratory tests:

(i) Studies on novel ‘omic’ biomarkers (proteomics, metabo-­

lomics, and transcriptomics) are needed to assess their
potential value for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in
cardiomyopathies.
(b) Multimodality imaging:

(i) Advanced echocardiographic techniques, including speckle
tracking deformation imaging, are promising but lack ro-­
bust validation in the setting of cardiomyopathies.

**3590** ESC Guidelines


(ii) A universally accepted, standardized method for the
quantification of myocardial fibrosis by CMR is lacking.
(iii) CMR scans may be performed in patients with compat-­

ible implantable devices, but the quality is limited by

artefacts.

(iv) Artificial intelligence enhanced electrocardiography and
imaging for cardiomyopathy evaluation has been proving
a novel tool to dramatically improve diagnosis and prog-­
nosis; further studies are needed for routine introduction

in clinical practice.
(v) Impact of CMR on screening in genotype-positive rela-­

tives of individuals with cardiomyopathy and in
gene-elusive families.
(c) Genetics:

(i) Penetrance is poorly characterized for most pathogenic
variants. This is true both for variants found through cas-­
cade screening of relatives of a patient with cardiomyop-­
athy, and also for variants found in the wider population
who may have clinical sequencing for another indication
or may choose to have genome sequencing as a screening

test.

(ii) The benefits, harm, and costs of screening of
cardiomyopathy-associated genes in individuals without
a personal or family history of cardiomyopathy is not

known.

(d) General principles in management:

(i) Management of RV failure remains largely

non-evidence-based.

(ii) Large-scale studies are required to guide ventricular ar-­

rhythmia management in patients with genetic
cardiomyopathies.
(iii) Optimal rate control and AADs per subtype of
cardiomyopathy.
(iv) The role of ICDs in patients with well tolerated VT.

(v) All risk calculators are developed using baseline data.
Therefore, the utility of their application during followup visits of patients remains unclear and needs to be

studied.

(vi) Risk prediction in childhood cardiomyopathies other
than HCM remains empirical—multicentre approach
required to understand and develop SCD risk models

in childhood.

(vii) Lack of controlled studies on the effect of ablation in pa-­

tients with AF and cardiomyopathy.
(viii) Models to predict AF recurrence have not been vali-­

dated in cardiomyopathy patients.
(ix) Lack of randomized studies assessing the efficacy of car-­

diac sympathetic denervation for the prevention of VT/

VF recurrences.

(e) Approach to paediatric cardiomyopathies:

(i) Lack of randomized studies or large registries addressing
the benefit and optimal dosing of drug therapy in paediat-­
ric population.
(5) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:

(a) Epidemiology:

(i) Imaging and genotype studies suggest a population preva-­

lence of up to 1 in 200 of the population. However,
HER-based studies suggest a much lower number of 3–
4/10 000. Further studies into the prevalence of clinically
important diseases are necessary.


(b) Aetiology:

(i) Aetiology of gene-elusive disease.
(ii) The role of polygenic risk.
(iii) Interaction between comorbidity and disease outcomes.
(iv) Genetic and environmental determinants of disease ex-­

pression in variant carriers.
(c) Symptom management:

(i) Optimal timing of LVOTO management and its impact on
disease progression.
(ii) Prevention of AF and heart failure.
(d) Sudden death prevention:

(i) Impact of genetics (Mendelian and complex) on risk of

disease-related outcomes.

(ii) Improved prediction models that reduce residual risk and
prevent unnecessary ICD implantation.
(iii) Refinement of risk-prediction models to include serial
data.

(iv) Role of LVOTO in risk prediction in children (apparent
discrepancy compared with adults).
(e) New therapies:

(i) Clinical utility of myosin inhibitors, other small molecules,
and emerging genetic therapies.
(6) Dilated cardiomyopathy:

(a) Genetic basis of familial DCM is still unknown in a high num-­

ber of cases.

(b) Detailed data about the specific clinical course in diverse gen-­

etic and non-genetic DCM forms are not available.
(c) It is unknown if patients with DCM respond differently to
pharmacological treatment according to underlying aetiology.
(d) Optimized SCD prevention strategy remains unsolved. There
are not data from prospective clinical trials in modern
cohorts with contemporary medical treatment. This gap is
knowledge is particularly relevant for DCM patients with
LVEF > 35%.

(e) Sport recommendations and utility of prophylactic pharma-­

cological therapy to prevent DCM onset in genetic carriers.
(7) Non-dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy:

(a) Prevalence of disease.
(b) Natural history and response to treatment.

(c) SCD prevention.
(d) Sports recommendations.
(8) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy:

(a) RCTs for therapies for the management of arrhythmias and
heart failure are lacking.
(b) Studies on the effect of exercise remain largely retrospective.

(c) Studies on the incidence and prognostication of heart failure

remain limited.

(d) Studies on the frequency and mode of clinical screening for
asymptomatic family members are lacking.
(9) Restrictive cardiomyopathy:

(a) SCD prevention.
(10) Syndromic and metabolic cardiomyopathies:

(a) Lack of randomized trials or large observational cohort stud-­

ies assessing the role of new target therapies addressing the
RAS/MAPK pathway (i.e trametinib).
(b) There are few long-term outcome studies addressing ven-­

tricular remodelling in RAS-HCM.
(c) HCM Risk-Kids has not been validated in paediatric patients
with RAS-HCM. Data regarding SCD risk stratification are
lacking, although candidate risk factors have been identified.

ESC Guidelines **3591**


(d) Lack of studies addressing the optimal timing to start ERT in
adolescents and adults with late-onset Pompe disease.
(e) Lack of standardized protocols to treat cross-reactive im-­

munologic material-negative patients.
(f) Lack of standardization of clinical endpoints in ERT/chaper-­

one therapy trials.
(g) Lack of head-to-head comparisons between agalsidase alpha

and beta.

(h) Optimal time to begin treatment in asymptomatic female pa-­

tients with non-classic disease.

(11) Amyloid:

(a) Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of
tafamidis in NYHA class III patients.
(b) SCD risk stratification and indications for ICD implantation
should be carefully defined, taking into account the estimated
life expectancy, competitive non-cardiovascular mortality,
and the high rate of pulseless electrical activity.
(c) The need for drug therapy in patients with cardiac amyloid-­

osis and subclinical cardiac involvement (i.e asymptomatic pa-­
tients, positive scintigraphy with negative ECHO) has not
been clearly defined.


(12) Sports:

(a) ‘Return to play’ for patients with low-risk cardiomyopathies
(and how to define low risk in relation to exercise).
(b) SCD risk and exercise recommendations in phenotypenegative gene carriers.
(c) Role of exercise in disease expression and progression.
(d) Large, adequately powered randomized prospective studies are
necessary to provide evidence-based recommendations for op-­
timal exercise prescription without compromising safety.
(13) Reproductive issues:

(a) Several cardiomyopathies lack specific outcome data regard-­

ing pregnancy.
(b) There is a lack of randomized trials on the use of AADs, heart
failure drugs, and interventions during pregnancy.
(14) Non-cardiac interventions:

(a) There is a lack specific outcome data regarding risks of noncardiac interventions.

(15) Management of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with
cardiomyopathies:
(a) There is a lack of data on the impact of comorbidities on
penetrance, severity, and outcome of cardiomyopathies.
