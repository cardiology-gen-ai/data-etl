###### **1. Preamble**

Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of as-­
sisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeut-­
ic approach for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines are
intended for use by health professionals and the European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) makes its Guidelines freely available.

ESC Guidelines do not override the individual responsibility of health
professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consider-­
ation of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that pa-­
tient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is
also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and reg-­
ulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of
prescription, and, where appropriate, to respect the ethical rules of
their profession.

ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given
topic and are regularly updated. ESC Policies and Procedures for for-­
mulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website
[(https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines).](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)



![Page 18 Images](Acute_Coronary_Syndromes_(ACS)_2023_images/page_018_images.png)

The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to
represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients
with this pathology. The selection procedure aimed to include
members from across the whole of the ESC region and from rele-­
vant ESC Subspecialty Communities. Consideration was given to
diversity and inclusion, notably with respect to gender and country
of origin. The Task Force performed a critical evaluation of diag-­
nostic and therapeutic approaches, including assessment of the
risk-benefit ratio. The strength of every recommendation and the
level of evidence supporting them were weighed and scored ac-­
cording to predefined scales as outlined below. The Task Force fol-­
lowed ESC voting procedures, and all approved recommendations
were subject to a vote and achieved at least 75% agreement among
voting members.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration
of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or
potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest
were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and
[can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[Guidelines) and have been compiled in a report published in a supple-­](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
mentary document with the guidelines. The Task Force received its en-­
tire financial support from the ESC without any involvement from the
healthcare industry.

The ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee supervises
and co-ordinates the preparation of new guidelines and is responsible
for the approval process. ESC Guidelines undergo extensive review
by the CPG Committee and external experts, including members
from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC
Subspecialty Communities and National Cardiac Societies. After appro-­
priate revisions, the guidelines are signed off by all the experts involved
in the Task Force. The finalized document is signed off by the CPG
Committee for publication in the *European Heart Journal* . The guidelines
were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical
knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their writing. Tables
of evidence summarizing the findings of studies informing development
of the guidelines are included. The ESC warns readers that the technical
language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this

respect.

Off-label use of medication may be presented in this guideline if a
sufficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically ap-­
propriate for a given condition. However, the final decisions concerning
an individual patient must be made by the responsible health profes-­
sional giving special consideration to:

- The specific situation of the patient. Unless otherwise provided for
by national regulations, off-label use of medication should be limited
to situations where it is in the patient’s interest with regard to the
quality, safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has
been informed and has provided consent.

- Country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental
drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which health profes-­
sionals are subject, where applicable.

Figure 1 Central illustration. ACS, acute coronary syndrome; CABG, coronary artery bypass grafting; ECG, electrocardiogram; LMWH, low molecularweight heparin; NSTE-ACS, non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; PPCI, primary percutaneous coronary
intervention; STEMI, ST-elevation myocardial infarction; UFH, unfractionated heparin. Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can initially present with
a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms and it is important that there is a high degree of awareness of this amongst both the general public and healthcare
providers. If ACS is suspected, think ‘A.C.S.’ for the initial triage and assessment. This involves performing an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for
**A** bnormalities or evidence of ischaemia, taking a targeted clinical history to assess the clinical **C** ontext of the presentation, and carrying out a targeted clinical
examination to assess for clinical and haemodynamic **S** tability. Based on the initial assessment, the healthcare provider can decide whether immediate invasive
management is required. Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) require primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) (or fibrinoly-­
sis if PPCI within 120 min is not feasible); patients with non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) with very high-risk features require immediate angiography ± PCI
if indicated; patients with NSTE-ACS and high-risk features should undergo inpatient angiography (angiography within 24 h should be considered). A com-­
bination of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy is indicated acutely for patients with ACS. The majority of patients with ACS will eventually undergo re-­
vascularization, most commonly with PCI. Once the final diagnosis of ACS has been established, it is important to implement measures to prevent recurrent
events and to optimize cardiovascular risk. This consists of medical therapy, lifestyle changes and cardiac rehabilitation, as well as consideration of psycho-­
social factors.

**3730** ESC Guidelines


**2.1. Definitions | Acute coronary**
**syndromes and myocardial infarction**

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) encompass a spectrum of condi-­
tions that include patients presenting with recent changes in clinical
symptoms or signs, with or without changes on 12-lead electrocardio-­
gram (ECG) and with or without acute elevations in cardiac tropo-­
nin (cTn) concentrations ( *Figure 2* ). Patients presenting with
suspected ACS may eventually receive a diagnosis of acute myocar-­
dial infarction (AMI) or unstable angina (UA). The diagnosis of


myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with cTn release and is
made based on the fourth universal definition of MI. [1] UA is defined
as myocardial ischaemia at rest or on minimal exertion in the ab-­
sence of acute cardiomyocyte injury/necrosis. It is characterized by
specific clinical findings of prolonged (>20 min) angina at rest; new
onset of severe angina; angina that is increasing in frequency, longer
in duration, or lower in threshold; or angina that occurs after a re-­
cent episode of MI. ACS are associated with a broad range of clinical
presentations, from patients who are symptom free at presentation
to patients with ongoing chest discomfort/symptoms and patients

with cardiac arrest, electrical/haemodynamic instability, or cardio-­
genic shock (CS) ( *Figure 2* ).

Patients presenting with suspected ACS are typically classified based
on ECG at presentation for the purposes of initial management. After
this, patients can be further classified based on the presence or absence
of cardiac troponin elevation (once these results are available), as de-­
monstrated in *Figures 2* and *3* . These features (ECG changes and cardiac
troponin elevation) are important in the initial triage and diagnosis of
patients with ACS, helping to risk stratify patients and guide the initial
management strategy. However, after the acute management and sta-­
bilization phase, most aspects of the subsequent management strategy
are common to all patients with ACS (regardless of the initial ECG
pattern or the presence/absence of cardiac troponin elevation at
presentation) and can therefore be considered under a common
pathway. A glossary of the terms related to invasive strategies and
reperfusion therapy commonly used in this document, and their
associated definitions, is provided in *Table 3* .

While they are closely related, it is important to recognize that ACS
is not the same as MI. [1] AMI is defined as cardiomyocyte necrosis in the
clinical setting of acute myocardial ischaemia. This includes MI due to
atherothrombotic events (Type 1 MI) and also other potential causes
of myocardial ischaemia and myocyte necrosis (Type 2–5 MI)
[(Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S1* ). Myocardial injury is another
distinct entity, used to describe troponin release due to mechanisms
other than myocardial ischaemia and not meeting the criteria for MI
outlined in [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S1* . Myocardial injury
can be acute or chronic depending on whether there is evidence of
dynamic change in the elevated troponins on serial testing. Some
causes of myocardial injury include myocarditis, sepsis, takotsubo car-­
diomyopathy, heart valve disease, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart fail-­
ure (HF).

The focus of this guideline is largely centred on the management of
patients who will eventually receive a diagnosis of Type 1 MI.
However, at every stage of the management of patients presenting
with ACS, physicians must carefully consider other differential diag-­
noses in their clinical assessment because they are common, asso-­
ciated with different underlying pathological mechanisms, have
different prognoses, and frequently require different treatment ap-­
proaches. More information is provided in the [Supplementary](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
[data online. In general, detailed information regarding the results](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
of individual trials will not be provided in the main guideline.
However, where appropriate, this information is provided in the
[Supplementary data online evidence tables.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

Figure 3 Classification of patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome: from a working to a final diagnosis. ACS, acute coronary syndrome;
ECG, electrocardiogram; FMC, first medical contact; hs-cTn, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin; MI, myocardial infarction; NSTE-ACS, non-ST-elevation acute
coronary syndrome; NSTEMI, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction: STEMI, ST-elevation myocardial infarction. [a] The working ACS diagnosis can be clas-­
sified as STEMI or NSTE-ACS on the basis of available clinical information and ECG findings. This allows for initial triage and assessment. [b] The final diagnosis is
based on symptoms, ECG and troponin for the diagnosis of MI as well as the results of other tests (i.e. imaging and/or angiography) to facilitate understanding
of the mechanism and subclassification of the type of MI. Patients initially assigned a working diagnosis of STEMI or NSTE-ACS may eventually receive a final
non-ACS diagnosis.


**2.2. Epidemiology of acute coronary**
**syndromes**
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of mortality
and morbidity worldwide, with a substantial portion of this burden
borne by low- and middle-income countries. [2][,][3] ACS is often the first
clinical manifestation of CVD. In 2019, there were an estimated 5.8 mil-­
lion new cases of ischaemic heart disease in the 57 ESC member coun-­
tries. [3] The median age-standardized incidence estimate per 100 000
people was 293.3 (interquartile ratio 195.8–529.5). CVD remains the
most common cause of death within ESC member countries, account-­
ing for just under 2.2 million deaths in females and just over 1.9 million
deaths in males in the most recent year of available data. Ischaemic


heart disease is the most common cause of CVD death, accounting
for 38% of all CVD deaths in females and 44% in males. [3]

**2.3. Number and breakdown of classes of**

**recommendations**

The total number of recommendations in this guideline is 193. A sum-­
mary of the recommendations according to Class of Recommendation
and Level of Evidence (LoE) is also provided. As per Class of
Recommendation, there were 106 Class I, 70 Class II, and 17 Class III
recommendations. As per LoE, there were 56 LoE A, 64 LoE B, and

73 LoE C recommendations.

**3.1. Clinical presentation and physical**
**examination**

**3.1.1. Clinical presentation**

Acute chest discomfort—which may be described as pain, pressure,
tightness, heaviness, or burning—is the leading presenting symptom


prompting consideration of the clinical diagnosis of ACS and the initi-­
ation of testing aligned with specific diagnostic algorithms ( *Figure 4* ).

Chest pain descriptors should be classified as cardiac, possibly car-­
diac, and likely non-cardiac. Further information on the suggested use
[of these terms is provided in the Supplementary data online. The use](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
of the descriptor ‘atypical’ should be avoided. Chest pain-equivalent
symptoms include dyspnoea, epigastric pain, and pain in the left or right
arm or neck/jaw.

Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis is sometimes due to an incomplete
history or difficulty in eliciting symptoms from the patient. In order to
understand the complexity of ACS-related symptomatology, careful
history taking and comprehensive interaction with the patient are
crucial and may help to facilitate an early and accurate diagnosis.

cation of ACS and the initial emergency management (i.e. for patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI or very high-risk NSTE-ACS) should not be delayed
based on this. [b] For patients with NSTE-ACS with very high-risk features, immediate angiography is recommended. For patients with NSTE-ACS with highrisk features, early invasive angiography (i.e. <24 h) should be considered and inpatient invasive angiography is recommended. See Recommendation Table 4

for details.


It is important that awareness of the symptoms associated with
ACS is high among the general population, in particular red flag
symptoms such as prolonged chest pain (>15 min) and/or recurrent
pain within 1 h, which should prompt patients or other members of


the public to seek urgent medical help. Continuous education, pro-­
motion, and advocacy efforts are important to make sure that this
information is as widely available as possible to the general
population.

ESC Guidelines **3737**


**3.1.2. History taking and physical examination**
Patients with suspected ACS present in a broad range of clinical scen-­
arios, including in the community, at the emergency department (ED),
or in the inpatient setting. It is crucial to take a focused medical history
and accurately characterize the presenting symptoms in order to
manage the patient via the appropriate care pathway as soon as
possible.

Prompt assessment of vital signs is recommended at first medical
contact (FMC), at the same time as acquisition of an initial ECG
( *Figure 5* ). In patients presenting with suspected ACS, physical examin-­
ation is recommended and is useful both to eliminate differential diag-­
noses and to identify very high-risk and high-risk ACS features. This may
be particularly relevant for patients presenting with cardiac arrest, signs
of CS, and/or haemodynamic or electrical instability. [4] Focused physical
examination should include checking for the presence of all major
pulses, measurement of blood pressure in both arms, auscultation of
the heart and lungs, and assessing for signs of HF or circulatory
compromise.


**3.2. Diagnostic tools | Electrocardiogram**
The resting 12-lead ECG is the first-line diagnostic tool in the assess-­
ment of patients with suspected ACS. It is recommended that an
ECG is obtained immediately upon FMC and interpreted by a qualified
emergency medical technician or physician within 10 min. [4][,][5] It should
be repeated as necessary, especially if symptoms have waned at FMC.
Based on the initial ECG, patients with suspected ACS can be differen-­
tiated into two working diagnoses:

- **Patients with acute chest pain (or chest pain-equivalent**
**signs/symptoms) and persistent ST-segment elevation**
**(or ST-segment elevation equivalents) on ECG (working**
**diagnosis: ST-segment elevation MI: STEMI)** . The vast major-­
ity of these patients will sustain myocardial necrosis and troponin ele-­
vation, fulfilling the criteria for an MI, but MI will not be the final
diagnosis in all patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI.

- **Patients with acute chest pain (or chest pain-equivalent**
**signs/symptoms) but without persistent ST-segment**






Figure 5 The A.C.S. assessment for the initial evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. ECG, electrocardiogram. This figure sum-­
marizes the initial ‘A.C.S. assessment’ that can be performed for a patient presenting with suspected ACS. ‘A’ stands for ‘Abnormal ECG?’: an ECG should be
performed within 10 min of FMC and assessed for evidence of abnormalities or ischaemia. ‘C’ stands for ‘Clinical Context?’: it is important to consider the
clinical context of the patient’s presentation and the results of any investigations that are available. This should also include a targeted history with the aim of
determining the patient’s symptoms and elucidating any other relevant background information. ‘S’ stands for ‘Stable Patient?’: the patient should be quickly
assessed to determine if they are clinically stable—this should include assessment of the clinical vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen
saturations, if possible, as well as checking for potential signs of CS.

**3738** ESC Guidelines


**elevation (or ST-segment elevation equivalents) on ECG**
**(working diagnosis: non-ST-elevation [NSTE]-ACS)** .
These patients may exhibit other ECG alterations, including transient
ST-segment elevation, persistent or transient ST-segment depres-­
sion, and T wave abnormalities, including hyperacute T waves, T
wave inversion, biphasic T waves, flat T waves, and pseudonormalization of T waves. Alternatively, the ECG may be normal.
The majority of patients in this category who subsequently display
a typical rise and fall in cardiac troponin levels (i.e. fulfilling MI criteria
as per the fourth universal definition of MI) will receive a final diagno-­
sis of non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI). In other patients, the troponin
level will remain below the 99th centile and they will receive a final
diagnosis of UA, although with high-sensitivity troponin assays this
diagnosis has become less common. It is also important to recognize
that NSTEMI or UA will not be the final diagnosis in all patients with
an initial working diagnosis of NSTE-ACS.

**3.2.1. Acute coronary syndrome with persistent**
**ST-segment elevation (suspected ST-elevation**
**myocardial infarction)**
The priority for these patients is the implementation of reperfusion ther-­
apy as soon as possible (see *Section 5* ). In the appropriate clinical context,
ST-segment elevation (measured at the J-point) is considered suggestive
of ongoing coronary artery acute occlusion in the following cases:

New ST elevation at the J-point in at least two contiguous leads:

- ≥2.5 mm in men <40 years, ≥2 mm in men ≥40 years, or ≥1.5 mm
in women regardless of age in leads V2–V3

- and/or ≥1 mm in the other leads (in the absence of left ventricular

[LV] hypertrophy or left bundle branch block [LBBB]).

In patients with suspected inferior STEMI, it is recommended to re-­
cord right precordial leads (V3R and V4R) in order to assess for
ST-segment elevation. [6] Posterior leads (V7–V9) can also be recorded
to investigate for posterior STEMI, particularly in patients with ongoing
symptoms and an inconclusive standard 12-lead ECG.

The diagnosis of ongoing acute coronary artery occlusion on ECG
can sometimes be challenging, and some cases may warrant prompt
management and triage for immediate reperfusion therapy despite
the absence of ST-segment elevation. It is also important to recognize
that while the most sensitive sign for ongoing acute coronary
artery occlusion is ST-segment elevation, there are other ECG find-­
ings that can be suggestive of ongoing coronary artery occlusion (or
severe ischaemia). If these findings are present, prompt triage for
[immediate reperfusion therapy is indicated (see Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
online, *[Figure S2](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* ).

ST-segment depression in leads V1–V3 (especially when the terminal
T wave is positive) and/or ST-segment elevation in V7–V9 are highly
suggestive of posterior coronary artery occlusion (often the left cir-­
cumflex artery). [1][,][7] ST-segment elevation in V3R and V4R is highly sug-­
gestive of ongoing RV ischaemia. [8] ST depression ≥1 mm in ≥6 surface
leads (inferolateral ST depression), coupled with ST-segment elevation


in aVR and/or V1, suggests multivessel ischaemia or left main coronary
artery obstruction, particularly if the patient presents with haemo-­
dynamic compromise. [9][–][11]

**Bundle branch block (BBB)** . In patients with a high clinical sus-­
picion of ongoing myocardial ischaemia, the presence of LBBB, right
bundle branch block (RBBB), or a paced rhythm precludes an accurate
assessment of the presence or absence of ST-segment elevation.
Therefore, patients presenting with these ECG patterns in combination
with signs/symptoms that are highly suspicious for ongoing myocardial
ischaemia should be managed similarly to those with clear ST-segment
elevation, regardless of whether the BBB is previously known (see
[Supplementary data online).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) [4]

**3.2.2. Acute coronary syndrome without persistent**
**ST-segment elevation (non-ST elevation acute**
**coronary syndrome)**

While the ECG in the setting of NSTE-ACS may be normal in more
than one-third of patients, characteristic ECG abnormalities are fre-­
quently present and increase the diagnostic probability of ACS. [12][–][16]

These ECG abnormalities include ST depression and T wave changes
(especially biphasic T waves or prominent negative T waves

[Wellens’ sign, related to severe proximal left anterior descending ar-­
[tery stenosis]), (see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Figure S3* ).

**3.3. Diagnostic tools | Biomarkers**
**3.3.1. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins**

After excluding clinical and ECG signs suggestive of STEMI or very highrisk NSTE-ACS, biomarkers play a complementary role in the diagnosis,
risk stratification, and management of patients with suspected ACS.
Measurement of a biomarker of cardiomyocyte injury, preferably highsensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn), is recommended in all patients
with suspected ACS. [15][,][17][,][25][–][27][,][53][,][54] If the clinical presentation is com-­
patible with myocardial ischaemia, then a rise and/or fall in cTn above
the 99th percentile of healthy individuals points to a diagnosis of MI
as per the criteria in the fourth universal definition of MI. [1] In patients
with MI, levels of cTn rise rapidly (i.e. usually within 1 h if using highsensitivity assays) after symptom onset and remain elevated for a vari-­
able period of time (usually several days). [1][,][15][,][26][,][53][,][55][–][58]

Advances in technology have led to a refinement in cTn assays and
have improved their accuracy in detecting and quantifying cardiomyo-­
cyte injury. [1][,][12][–][15][,][18][,][26][,][34][,][35][,][53][,][55][–][60] Data from large multicentre studies
have consistently shown that hs-cTn assays increase diagnostic accuracy
for MI at the time of presentation in comparison to conventional assays,
especially in patients presenting early after chest pain onset, enabling
more rapid ‘rule-in’ and ‘rule-out’ of MI. [1][,][12][–][15][,][26][,][34][,][35][,][53][,][55][–][58] Overall,
hs-cTn T and hs-cTn I subunit assays appear to provide comparable
diagnostic accuracy in the early diagnosis of MI. [28][,][32][,][61][,][62] The use of

the terms ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ to describe hs-cTn levels should

be avoided; instead, the terms *‘non-elevated’* and *‘elevated’* should be

used to refer to hs-cTn levels below and above the 99th percentile.


Some of the clinical implications of hs-cTn assays are detailed in
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S2* .

It is also important to consider that there are other clinical conditions
apart from Type 1 MI in which elevations in cTn can be observed (see
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Section 3.3.1* and *Table S3* ).

**3.3.2. Central laboratory vs. point of care**

The vast majority of cTn assays that run on automated platforms in the
central laboratory are sensitive (i.e. allow for the detection of cTn in

∼
20–50% of healthy individuals) or high-sensitivity (i.e. allow for the de-­
tection of cTn in ∼50–95% of healthy individuals) assays.
High-sensitivity assays are recommended over lower-sensitivity assays,
as they provide higher diagnostic accuracy at an identical low
cost. [1][,][12][,][15][,][25][–][27][,][57][,][63]

The majority of currently used point-of-care (POC) tests cannot be
considered high-sensitivity assays. [64] The advantage of POC tests is a
shorter turnaround time. However, this is counterbalanced by lower
sensitivity, lower diagnostic accuracy, and lower negative predictive va-­
lue (NPV). A randomized trial in low-risk chest pain patients with sus-­
pected NSTE-ACS and onset of symptoms ≥2 h before ambulance
presentation reported that the use of a pre-hospital rule-out strategy
(with a single POC conventional troponin T test) resulted in a signifi-­
cant reduction of 30-day healthcare costs and a comparable major ad-­
verse cardiovascular event (MACE) rate in comparison to an ED
rule-out strategy (with evaluation as per standard local practice). [65]

Overall, automated assays have been more thoroughly evaluated
than POC tests and are currently preferred. [1][,][12][–][15][,][26][,][34][,][35][,][53][,][55][–][58]

However, this is a rapidly developing field and it will be important to
re-evaluate this preference when more extensively validated highsensitivity POC tests are clinically available. [66][–][68]

**3.3.3. Confounders of cardiac troponin concentration**

In patients presenting with suspected NSTE-ACS, four clinical variables
affect hs-cTn concentrations beyond the presence or absence of MI.
These variables are: age (concentrations in healthy very young vs.
‘healthy’ very old individuals differ by up to 300%); renal dysfunction
(differences between otherwise healthy patients with very high vs.
very low estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of up to 300%);
time from chest pain onset (>300%); and, to a lesser extent, sex
(≈40%). [28][,][34][,][35][,][69][–][76] Despite the potential baseline differences in
hs-cTn values based on these four variables, absolute changes in
hs-cTn levels are still of diagnostic and prognostic value. Current data
on the use of sex-specific hs-cTn values in the diagnosis of MI have
been controversial and failed to demonstrate a clear clinical bene-­
fit. [74][,][75][,][77][–][80] Therefore, until automated tools (i.e. risk assessment cal-­
culators) incorporating the effect of all four clinical variables (age,
eGFR, time from chest pain onset, and sex) are available, the use of uni-­
form cut-off concentrations should remain the standard of care for the
early diagnosis of MI. [28][,][30][,][31][,][34][,][35][,][73][,][81][,][82]

**3.3.4. Rapid ‘rule-in’ and ‘rule-out’ algorithms**

Due to their higher sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy for the detection
of MI at presentation, the time interval to the second cTn assessment
can be shortened with the use of hs-cTn assays. This substantially re-­
duces the delay to diagnosis, translating into shorter stays in the ED,
lower costs, and less diagnostic uncertainty for patients. [15][,][83][–][88] It is re-­
commended to use the 0 h/1 h algorithm (best option) or the 0 h/2 h

algorithm (second-best option) ( *Figure 6* ). These algorithms have been
derived and validated in large multicentre diagnostic studies using cen-­
tral adjudication of the final diagnosis for all currently available hs-cTn
assays. [27][–][39][,][62][,][70][,][73][,][82][,][89][–][93] Optimal thresholds for rule-out were se-­
lected to allow a sensitivity and NPV of at least 99%. Optimal thresholds
for rule-in were selected to allow a positive predictive value (PPV) of at
least 70%. These algorithms were developed from large derivation co-­
horts and then validated in large independent validation cohorts. The
previous ESC 0 h/3 h algorithm was considered as an alternative, [40][,][56]

but three recent large diagnostic studies suggested that the ESC 0 h/
3 h algorithm appears to balance efficacy and safety less well than
more rapid protocols using lower rule-out concentrations, including
the ESC 0 h/1 h algorithm. [41][–][43] The very high safety and high efficacy
of applying the ESC 0 h/1 h algorithm was recently confirmed in three
real-life implementation studies, including one randomized controlled
trial (RCT). [44][,][94][,][95] Therefore, the ESC 0 h/3 h algorithm is an alternative
for cases where the ESC 0 h/1 h or 0 h/2 h algorithms are not available.
Of note, patients assigned to the ‘rule-out’ pathway using the ESC 0 h/
1 h or 0 h/2 h algorithms have a very low rate of clinical events through
to 30 days. [95][,][96]

*3.3.4.1. European Society of Cardiology 0 h/1 h and 0 h/2 h*
*algorithms*

The ESC 0 h/1 h and 0 h/2 h algorithms are based on two underlying
concepts: firstly, hs-cTn is a continuous variable and the probability
of MI increases with increasing hs-cTn values. [28][,][30][,][31][,][34][,][35][,][73][,][82]

Secondly, early absolute changes in the levels within 1 h or 2 h can be
used as surrogates for absolute changes over 3 h or 6 h and provide in-­
cremental diagnostic value to the single cTn assessment at presenta-­
tion. [27][,][28][,][30][,][31][,][34][,][35][,][73][,][82][,][97] The cut-off concentrations within the 0 h/

[1 h and 0 h/2 h algorithms are assay specific (Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
online, *[Table S4](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* ). [27][,][28][,][30][,][31][,][34][,][35][,][73][,][82]

*3.3.4.1.1. Rule-out.* The NPV for MI in patients assigned to the
‘rule-out’ pathway has exceeded 99% in several large validation
cohorts. [28][–][30][,][34][,][35][,][73] Assignment to the rule-out pathway does not al-­
ways equal outpatient management. However, when used in conjunc-­
tion with clinical and ECG findings, the 0 h/1 h and 0 h/2 h algorithms
will enable the identification of appropriate candidates for early dis-­
charge and outpatient management. Even after the ruling out of MI,
elective non-invasive or invasive imaging may be appropriate according
to clinical and risk assessment, and an alternative diagnosis to MI should
be identified.

*3.3.4.1.2. Rule-in.* The PPV for MI in patients meeting the ‘rule-in’
pathway criteria in several studies has been ∼70–75%. Most of the


‘rule-in’ pathway patients with diagnoses other than MI still have condi-­
tions that require specialist cardiology input and either coronary angi-­
ography or non-invasive imaging in order to establish an accurate
final diagnosis. [28][,][30][,][31][,][34][,][35][,][73][,][82] Therefore, the vast majority of patients
triaged towards the ‘rule-in’ pathway by these algorithms will require
hospital admission and invasive coronary angiography (ICA).

*3.3.4.1.3. Observe.* Patients who do not qualify for the ‘rule-out’ or
‘rule-in’ pathways are assigned to the ‘observe’ pathway. These patients re-­
present a heterogeneous group and have been shown to have a mortality
rate that is comparable to rule-in patients. [98] Therefore, an individual as-­
sessment based on the particular risk profile of the patient (i.e. risk scores)
is of paramount importance for patients in this group. Additionally, a third
measurement of cTn at 3 h (± echocardiography) is recommended as the
next step in order to guide further management. [45][,][46]

Most patients in the observe zone with a high degree of clinical
suspicion of ACS (e.g. relevant increase in cTn from presentation
to 3 h) are candidates for ICA. Conversely, most patients with a
low to intermediate likelihood for ACS according to clinical judg-­
ment are candidates for non-invasive imaging after transfer from
the ED to the ward. Computed tomography (CT) angiography can
be used to aid diagnosis and, in particular, to identify patients with
non-obstructed coronary arteries who can be discharged if other
relevant diseases have been excluded. CT angiography can also iden-­
tify patients with obstructive coronary disease in whom revascular-­
ization may be considered. In the appropriate clinical context, if
alternative conditions have been identified that explain the cTn va-­
lues (i.e. rapid ventricular rate response to atrial fibrillation [AF],
marked anaemia, or a hypertensive emergency), further diagnostic
testing (i.e. ICA) may not be required.

The same concepts apply to the 0 h/2 h algorithm. Cut-off levels for
both the 0 h/1 h and 0 h/2 h algorithms are also assay specific, and these
[cut-off levels are shown in Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S4* . [99]

The ESC 0 h/1 h and 0 h/2 h algorithms should always be integrated
with a detailed clinical assessment and a 12-lead ECG. Repeat blood
sampling is mandatory in cases where there is ongoing or recurrent
chest pain. Recently, artificial intelligence models that include serial
hs-cTn measurements in conjunction with individual risk profiles have
been proposed to be useful to facilitate a personalized diagnostic evalu-­
ation of patients with suspected MI. Similarly, risk-assessment models
combining hs-cTn values at presentation and after early or late resam-­
pling have been developed to predict MI events during the first 30 days.
These models may facilitate alternative hs-cTn cut-offs based on the
balance between NPV and PPV best suited to individual clinical sites. [27]

A diagnostic approach to the use of the ESC 0 h/1 h and 0 h/2 h algo-­
rithms is shown in *Figure 6* .

Figure 6 The 0 h/1 h or 0 h/2 h rule-out and rule-in algorithms using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays in patients presenting to the emergency de-­
partment with suspected NSTEMI and without an indication for immediate invasive angiography. hs-cTn, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin; NSTEMI,
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Patients are classified into one of three pathways as per the results of their hs-cTn values at 0 h (time of initial blood
test) and 1 h or 2 h later. Patients with a very low initial hs-cTn value or patients with a low initial value and no 1 h/2 h change in hs-cTn are assigned to the
‘rule-out’ pathway. Patients with a high initial hs-cTn value or a 1 h/2 h change in hs-cTn are assigned to the ‘rule-in’ pathway. Patients who do not meet the
criteria for the rule-out or rule-in strategies are assigned to the ‘observe’ pathway, and these patients should have hs-cTn levels checked at 3 h ± echocar-­
diography in order to decide on further management. Cut-offs are assay specific (see [Supplementary material online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S4* ) and derived to meet
pre-defined criteria for sensitivity and specificity for NSTEMI. Potential management and testing options for each of the three strategies are provided in
the relevant sections of the main text. [12][–][15][,][26][,][27][,][53][,][55][–][58][,][100][,][101][ a] Only applicable if the chest pain onset was >3 h prior to the 0 h hs-cTn measurement.

**3742** ESC Guidelines


*3.3.4.2. Practical guidance on how to implement the European*
*Society of Cardiology 0 h/1 h algorithm*

In order to maximize the safety and feasibility of implementing the 0 h/
1 h algorithm, blood samples for hs-cTn at 0 h and 1 h should be ob-­
tained irrespective of other clinical details and pending results (see ca-­
[veats of using rapid algorithms in Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Section 3.3.*
*[2.2](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* ). This may result in unnecessary cTn measurements in the ∼10–
15% of patients with very low 0 h concentrations and chest pain onset
>3 h, but substantially facilitates the process and thereby further in-­
creases patient safety. Similarly, the 0 h blood sample should be ob-­
tained immediately after admission to the ED.

**3.3.5. Other biomarkers**

The use of biomarkers other than cTn for the diagnosis of ACS is not
recommended (unless cTn is not available). Among the multitude of
additional biomarkers evaluated for the diagnosis of NSTEMI, only cre-­
atine kinase myocardial band isoenzyme, myosin-binding protein C, and
copeptin may have clinical relevance when used in combination with
(standard) cTn T/I, although in most clinical situations their incremental
value above and beyond cTn is limited. [45][,][46][,][83][,][102][–][114]

**3.4. Diagnostic tools | Non-invasive imaging**
**3.4.1. Echocardiography**
In emergency rooms and chest pain units, transthoracic echocardiog-­
raphy (TTE) performed or interpreted by trained healthcare profes-­
sionals should be routinely available. In cases of suspected ACS with
diagnostic uncertainty, TTE can be useful to identify signs suggestive of
ongoing ischaemia or prior MI. However, this should not result in rele-­
vant delays in transfer to the cardiac catheterization laboratory if there
is suspicion of an acute coronary artery occlusion. TTE can also be useful
to suggest alternative aetiologies associated with chest pain (i.e. acute
aortic disease, RV signs in pulmonary embolism [PE]). All patients pre-­
senting with CS or haemodynamic instability should undergo emergency
TTE to try to identify the underlying cause—in particular, to assess LV
and RV function and look for evidence of mechanical complications.

**3.4.2. Computed tomography**

Upon clinical presentation, CT is often the diagnostic tool of choice for
ruling out alternative potentially life-threatening differential diagnoses
of ACS, like PE or aortic dissection (this should be an ECG-gated con-­
trast CT angiogram with full coverage of the thoracic aorta and the
proximal head and neck vessels). Generally, CT does not have a role
in patients presenting with suspicion of ongoing acute coronary occlu-­
sion, for whom emergency ICA is the priority.

Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has been investigated in many trials
for the assessment of patients presenting to the ED with suspected
NSTE-ACS. However, trials investigating CCTA in the era of hs-cTn as-­
says may be of greater relevance for contemporary practice. The
BEACON (Better Evaluation of Acute Chest Pain with Coronary
Computed Tomography Angiography) study showed no reduction of inhospital duration of stay or hospital admission in the CCTA arm com-­
pared with patients investigated with hs-cTn, with similar results to those
observed in the ROMICAT II (Rule Out Myocardial Ischemia/Infarction by
Computer Assisted Tomography) and RAPID-CTCA (Rapid Assessment
of Potential Ischaemic Heart Disease with CTCA) trials. [115][–][117] In the lat-­
ter study, a default approach using early non-invasive CCTA in patients
with suspected NSTE-ACS did not improve clinical outcomes at 1 year

and was associated with a modest increase in the duration and cost of

the hospital stay. A default approach using CCTA as the first-line imaging
investigation in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS is therefore not


recommended. However, CCTA may provide added value in certain clin-­
ical settings (i.e. for patients in the observe zone in whom cTn and ECG
results remain inconclusive). A normal CCTA (ruling out both obstructive
and non-obstructive plaque) has a high NPV to exclude ACS and is asso-­
ciated with excellent clinical outcomes.

The systematic use of CCTA in rule-out patients after hospital dis-­
charge may identify the presence of obstructive or non-obstructive pla-­
que and guide preventative medical therapies. [118] CCTA can also be
used to risk stratify selected low-risk NSTEMI patients. Such patients,
who are found to have normal coronary arteries, non-obstructive cor-­
onary disease, or distal obstructive disease, may then not require
ICA. [119][–][121] Of note, the utility of CCTA may be limited in patients
with tachycardia, established coronary artery disease (CAD), previous
stents, or extensive coronary calcification.

**3.4.3. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with or**
**without stress testing**
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging delineates cardiac struc-­
ture and function, and also has the ability to provide assessments of
myocardial perfusion and the pattern of myocardial injury. CMR is
the imaging test of choice when poor echocardiographic windows pre-­
clude diagnostic echocardiographic evaluation. CMR allows direct visu-­
alization of infarcted regions, providing information on scarring and
viability that can be differentiated from other forms of myocardial injury
(e.g. myocarditis). CMR is therefore of particular clinical value in estab-­
lishing a diagnosis of AMI where there is diagnostic uncertainty. CMR
can also be useful in identifying the culprit vascular territory and in con-­
firming a diagnosis of myocarditis or takotsubo cardiomyopathy,
amongst other differentials. CMR is of particular value in establishing
a diagnosis in patients presenting with a working diagnosis of myocardial
infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) following
invasive angiography and is the gold standard for the assessment of LV

thrombus.

ESC Guidelines **3743**


Cardiac magnetic resonance can also assess myocardial perfusion
with pharmacological stress. This can be used as an alternative to
CCTA in the assessment of patients in the observe zone following
ECG and hs-cTn assessments, particularly in those with advanced, es-­
tablished CAD, in whom assessments of myocardial perfusion and via-­
bility may provide more useful information than CCTA. Some
additional information on CMR, single-photon emission computerized
tomography (SPECT) perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography
[is provided in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

Depending on local expertise and availability, other forms of stress
imaging (e.g. SPECT, nuclear, stress echo) can be used to assess patients

in the observe zone.

**3.5. Differential diagnosis for acute chest**
**pain**
Several cardiac and non-cardiac conditions that may mimic ACS should
be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain as part of
the clinical assessment. More information about the differential diagno-­
sis of acute chest pain is provided in the sections on MINOCA and Type
[2 MI and in the Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S5* .
###### **4. Initial measures for patients ** **presenting with suspected acute ** **coronary syndrome | Initial ** **treatment**

**4.1. Pre-hospital logistics of care**
Individuals experiencing acute chest pain in the community represent
an undifferentiated population, often presenting *ad hoc* to first med-­
ical responders in the pre-hospital setting. These patients should
undergo immediate risk assessment and triage following local proto-­
cols established within the emergency medical service (EMS)
( *Figures 7* and *8* ).

If the first responding medical professional suspects ACS, a 12-lead
ECG should be acquired and analysed as soon as possible. It is recom-­
mended that all medical and paramedical personnel caring for ACS pa-­
tients within the EMS setting have access to defibrillation equipment
and are trained in basic cardiac life support. Patients with suspected
ACS are initially categorized on the basis of the 12-lead ECG and
triaged into two initial treatment pathways: (i) one for patients with
an ECG consistent with STEMI (persistent ST-segment elevation or
equivalent ECG patterns) ( *Figure 7* ); and (ii) one for patients without
ST-segment elevation or equivalent ECG patterns (suspected
NSTE-ACS) ( *Figure 8* ). The initial ECG-guided risk stratification should
also trigger treatment decisions in the pre-hospital setting, including the
choice of target hospital, and serve to determine the sequence of initial
investigations and interventions (including pharmacological), in particu-­
lar, the timing of ICA.

An initial diagnosis of suspected STEMI portends a higher risk of im-­
mediate, life-threatening complications (e.g. ventricular fibrillation

[VF]). Accordingly, there is an indication for initiating an emergency re-­
perfusion strategy and direct transfer to a centre with 24/7 PCI capabil-­
ities. Patients who present with an ECG without ST-segment elevation
(or equivalent ECG patterns) but have ongoing ischaemic symptoms
should undergo pre-hospital triage in accordance with protocols for pa-­
tients in the STEMI pathway, since they also face immediate risks, in-­
cluding ventricular arrhythmias.


**4.1.1. Time to treatment**

Time to treatment is vital for the care of patients triaged to the STEMI
pathway. Components of the total ischaemic time, contributors to delays
in initial management, and the selection of reperfusion strategy for STEMI
patients are shown in *Figure 7* . Treatment times reflect the efficiency and
quality of care of a system taking care of patients with suspected STEMI.
The multidisciplinary STEMI treatment pathway should be subject to
continuous clinical audit in order to assess the treatment times for indi-­
vidual patients and identify opportunities for healthcare improvement
through quality indicators (QIs). If projected QIs are not met, interven-­
tions are needed to improve the performance of the system.

Recognition of ischaemic symptoms by individuals in the community
has pivotal importance in activation of the out-of-hospital pathway, and
this is especially relevant to first responders without healthcare training.
The recommended action should be to contact the EMS rather than to

self-present to an ED or primary care clinician.

The time from symptom onset to ‘first call for help’ is associated with
socioeconomic factors and sex. [128] In order to avoid delays through fail-­
ure to recognize and act on symptoms of a ‘heart attack’, community
education initiatives should target less well-served groups (i.e. those
from deprived communities, ethnic minority groups) and use targeted
public health messaging (i.e. avoiding stereotyped messaging that under-­
pins a negative bias based on sex, ethnicity, or social background, and
using language and images that will resonate with those groups).
System delays are representative of the quality of care and it is recom-­
mended to measure these as QIs.

**4.1.2. Healthcare systems and system delays**

For patients with suspected STEMI, the system delay (the time from
when the patient contacts the healthcare system to reperfusion) is
amenable to improvement by organizational measures, whereas patient
delay is multifactorial. System delay is a predictor of mortality in STEMI
patients treated with primary PCI (PPCI). [129][–][131] When a working diag-­
nosis of STEMI is made in the pre-hospital setting (EMS), immediate ac-­
tivation of the catheterization laboratory team reduces treatment
delays and mortality. [132][–][136]

When a STEMI working diagnosis is made by the EMS in the prehospital setting and the patient is triaged for emergency invasive manage-­
ment, they should bypass the ED and go straight to the catheterization
laboratory. Bypassing the ED is associated with a significant saving in the
time from FMC to wire crossing and may be associated with improved
survival. [137][–][139] For patients presenting to a non-PCI centre with a sus-­
pected STEMI, the ‘door-in to door-out time’—defined as the duration
between arrival of the patient at the hospital to discharge of the patient
in an ambulance ‘en route’ to the PCI centre—is also an important clinical
performance measure, and a door-in to door-out time of ≤30 min is re-­
commended to expedite reperfusion therapy. [140]

**4.1.3. Emergency medical services**
At a national level, an EMS with an easily recalled and well-publicised un-­
ique medical dispatching number (112 for most European Union coun-­
tries) is important to speed-up system activation. Parallel circuits
for the referral and transport of patients with suspected STEMI that by-­
pass the EMS should be avoided. The ambulance system plays a critical
role in the early management of patients with suspected STEMI, including
immediately establishing the initial diagnosis, triage, and treatment. [129][,][141]

Ambulances in the EMS must be equipped with ECG recorders, de-­
fibrillators, telemetry devices, and at least one person trained in ad-­
vanced life support. The quality of the care provided depends on the

**3744** ESC Guidelines


training of the staff involved. Ambulance personnel must be trained to
recognize ischaemic symptoms, administer oxygen when appropriate,
secure intravenous (i.v.) access, effectively relieve pain, administer fi-­
brinolysis when indicated, and provide basic life support. [142]

Ambulance staff should record an ECG as soon as possible for diagnos-­
tic purposes and either interpret the ECG or transmit it so that it can be
reviewed by experienced staff to establish or refute a working diagnosis
of STEMI. Regular and structured training of ambulance staff is manda-­
tory for a high-quality pre-hospital service.

**4.1.4. General practitioners**

In some countries, primary care clinicians (general practitioners) play an
important role in the early care of patients with suspected ACS and
may provide the FMC. Education and training of general practitioners
in emergency, pre-hospital care is essential for the delivery of optimal
pre-hospital care in this setting. The responsibilities of the primary
care clinicians may include diagnosis, activation of the EMS, risk stratifi-­
cation, and initiation of pre-hospital treatment. However, in most set-­
tings, consultation with a general practitioner instead of a direct call to
the EMS will increase the pre-hospital delay. Therefore, the public
should be educated to call the EMS directly rather than a primary
care physician for symptoms suggestive of ACS.

**4.1.5. Organization of ST-elevation myocardial**
**infarction treatment in networks**

It is recommended that a regional reperfusion strategy is established to
maximize the efficiency of care for patients with a working diagnosis of
STEMI. [143] The optimal treatment of patients with a working diagnosis
of STEMI should be based on the implementation of networks between
hospitals with various levels of clinical service provision (the ‘hub and
spoke’ model), linked by a prioritized and efficient ambulance service.
A PCI centre is a multidisciplinary acute care centre that provides emer-­
gency invasive management 24/7 for patients presenting with suspected
STEMI. This centre should also provide intensive care facilities, and
more advanced centres should offer cardio-thoracic services, advanced

haemodynamic support, and surgery.

The goal of STEMI networks is to provide optimal care while minimizing
delays, thereby improving clinical outcomes. Cardiologists should actively
collaborate with all stakeholders, particularly emergency physicians, in estab-­
lishing such networks. The main features of such a network are detailed in
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S6* . It is recommended that the EMS should
transport patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI to hospitals with a 24/7
service for PCI, bypassing non-PCI-capable hospitals. [144] Further information
[on this topic is provided in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

Geographic areas where the expected transfer time to the primary
PCI centre makes it impossible to routinely achieve the maximal allow-­
able delays indicated in the recommendations should develop protocols
for rapid fibrinolysis at the place of STEMI diagnosis, with the aim of
treatment within 10 min of FMC, followed by immediate transfer to
a centre with 24/7 service for PCI. Such networks increase the propor-­
tion of patients receiving reperfusion with the shortest possible treat-­
ment delay. [145][–][147] The quality of care, time delays, and patient
outcomes should be measured and reported to the healthcare profes-­
sionals contributing to the EMS.

**4.2. Emergency care**
**4.2.1. Initial diagnosis and monitoring**

Management of ACS starts from the point of FMC, when a working
diagnosis of ACS is established. The working diagnosis of ACS is usually


based on symptoms consistent with myocardial ischaemia and the signs
on a 12-lead ECG (see *Section 3.2* ). It is recommended to initiate ECG
monitoring as soon as possible in all patients with suspected ACS in or-­
der to detect life-threatening arrhythmias and to allow prompt defibril-­
lation if indicated.

**4.2.2. Acute pharmacotherapy**
*4.2.2.1. Oxygen*
Oxygen supplementation is recommended in ACS patients with hypox-­
aemia (oxygen saturations <90%). Oxygen supplementation in patients
who are not hypoxic (oxygen saturations >90%) is not associated with
clinical benefits and is therefore not recommended. [148][,][149]

*4.2.2.2. Nitrates*

Sublingual nitrate may be helpful to relieve ischaemic symptoms.
However, a reduction in chest pain after nitroglycerine administra-­
tion can be misleading and is not recommended as a diagnostic man-­
oeuvre. [150] In patients with an ECG compatible with ongoing STEMI
and symptom relief after nitroglycerine administration, it is recom-­
mended to obtain another 12-lead ECG. Complete normalization
of ST-segment elevation, along with relief of symptoms, after nitro-­
glycerine administration is suggestive of coronary spasm, with or
without associated MI. Nitrates should not be given to patients
with hypotension, marked bradycardia or tachycardia, RV infarction,
known severe aortic stenosis, or phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor use
within the previous 24–48 h.

*4.2.2.3. Pain relief*

Intravenous opioids (e.g. morphine 5–10 mg) should be considered for
the relief of severe chest pain. Other forms of pain relief (e.g. nitrous
oxide/oxygen plus i.v. acetaminophen/paracetamol) have been re-­
ported to be inferior to morphine. [151] However, morphine may en-­
hance nausea and vomiting and slow the gastrointestinal absorption
of oral medicines, which may delay the onset of action of orally admi-­
nistered antiplatelet therapy. [152][,][153] Evidence from small-scale trials sug-­
gests that i.v. morphine may also reduce myocardial and microvascular
damage when given to patients with ongoing acute coronary artery oc-­
clusion, though co-administration with metoclopramide appears to
negate this effect. Conversely, morphine has also been reported to re-­
duce antiplatelet activity after administration of ticagrelor, though this
effect was rescued by metoclopramide administration. [154][,][155] The posi-­
tive effects of morphine on myocardial damage may potentially be re-­
lated to reduced oxygen consumption as a result of decreased
preload and negative inotropy and chronotropy.

Platelet inhibition induced by oral P2Y 12 receptor antagonists may
be delayed in patients with ongoing MI. Morphine may also further re-­
duce absorption, delay the onset of action, and decrease the antipla-­
telet effect of oral P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors in MI patients, although
this effect may vary between the different P2Y 12 inhibitors. [153][,][156][– ]

158 Further research is ongoing in this area, but at present it should
be noted that currently available clinical data have not demonstrated
any increase in the risk of adverse clinical outcomes as a result of any
interaction between morphine and antiplatelet agents in the setting of
ACS. [159][–][161]

*4.2.2.4. Intravenous beta-blockers*

Few RCTs testing early i.v. beta-blockers have been performed in
the era of invasive management for patients with a working diagnosis
of STEMI. Not all beta-blockers appear to exert the same

ESC Guidelines **3745**


cardio-protective effect in the context of ongoing acute coronary oc-­
clusion, with metoprolol demonstrating the greatest protective effect
in experimental studies. [162] Intravenous metoprolol is also the most
widely tested beta-blocker in trials enrolling patients undergoing
PPCI. [163][,][164] While the long-term clinical benefits associated with early
i.v. metoprolol administration are not clear, it is safe when used in pa-­
tients without signs of acute HF and has been consistently associated

with a reduction in the incidence of VF and microvascular obstruction
(MVO). [163][–][171] Based on these data, i.v. beta-blockers (preferably meto-­
prolol) should be considered at the time of presentation in patients

**5.1. Selection of invasive strategy and**
**reperfusion therapy**
The definitions of the terms related to invasive strategy and reperfusion
therapy are presented in *Table 3* .

Depending on the initial assessment of the ECG, the clinical context
and haemodynamic stability, patients with suspected ACS should be
classified as either:

(i) Patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI. These patients should
be triaged for immediate reperfusion therapy (i.e. a PPCI strategy
or fibrinolysis if PPCI is not possible within 120 min of diagnosis)
( *Figure 7* ).

Or

(ii) Patients with a working diagnosis of NSTE-ACS. For these patients:

  - An inpatient invasive strategy is recommended.

  - An immediate invasive strategy is recommended when any very
high-risk feature is present ( *Figure 8* ).

  - An early (i.e. within 24 h) invasive strategy should be considered
when any high-risk features are present ( *Figure 8* ).

**5.2. Acute coronary syndrome managed**
**with invasive strategy**
Invasive management strategies are time sensitive. It is recommended that
patients triaged to an immediate invasive strategy (those with high suspi-­
cion of ongoing acute coronary artery occlusion [i.e. persistent
ST-segment elevation or equivalents] or NSTE-ACS with any very highrisk characteristics) receive emergency angiography as soon as possible.
High-risk NSTE-ACS patients (e.g. ruled in as NSTEMI as per the 0 h/1 h
or 0 h/2 h ESC algorithms, with dynamic ST-segment or T wave changes,
with transient ST-segment elevation, or with a Global Registry of Acute
Coronary Events [GRACE] risk score >140) should be considered for
an early invasive strategy (i.e. undergoing angiography within 24 h).

**5.2.1. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention**
**strategy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction**
In patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI, a PPCI strategy (i.e. im-­
mediate angiography and PCI as needed) is the preferred reperfusion
strategy, provided it can be performed in a timely manner (i.e. within

120 min of the ECG-based diagnosis, *Figure 7* ). RCTs have shown that if
the delay to treatment is similar, PPCI is superior to fibrinolysis in reducing
mortality, non-fatal reinfarction, and stroke. [52][,][179] However, in some cir-­
cumstances, PPCI is not an immediate option and fibrinolysis should be
initiated expeditiously as part of a pharmaco-invasive strategy, provided
the patient has presented within 12 h of symptom onset (see *Section 5.3* ).

There is a lack of contemporaneous data to inform the treatment delay
limit at which the advantage of PCI over fibrinolysis is lost. For simplicity, an
absolute time of 120 min from STEMI diagnosis to PCI-mediated reperfu-­
sion (i.e. wire crossing of the infarct-related artery [IRA]) rather than a rela-­
tive PCI-related delay over fibrinolysis has been chosen. Given the
recommended time interval of 10 min from STEMI diagnosis to administra-­
tion of a bolus of fibrinolytics (see below), the 120 min absolute time delay
would correspond to a relative PCI-related delay in the range of 110–
120 min. This is within the range of the times identified as the limit of delay
below which PCI should be chosen in older studies and registries. [176][,][180][–][184]

For patients who undergo fibrinolysis, rescue PCI is indicated if fibrin-­
olysis fails (i.e. ST-segment resolution <50% within 60–90 min of fi-­
brinolytic administration) or in the presence of haemodynamic or
electrical instability, worsening ischaemia, or persistent chest
pain. [184][,][185] Patients with successful fibrinolysis should undergo early


invasive angiography (i.e. within 2–24 h from the time of the lytic bolus
injection) (see *Section 5.3* ). [186]

Patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI who present to a
non-PCI centre should be immediately transferred to a PCI-capable
centre ( *Figure 7* ) for a timely PPCI strategy. If PPCI is not feasible within
120 min, patients should undergo immediate fibrinolysis followed by
transfer to a PCI centre without waiting for signs of reperfusion. For
patients presenting after 12 h from symptom onset, a PPCI strategy
is preferred over fibrinolysis in all cases.

Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery should
be considered for patients with a patent IRA but with unsuitable anat-­
omy for PCI, and either a large myocardial area at jeopardy or with CS.
In patients with MI-related mechanical complications who require cor-­
onary revascularization, CABG is recommended at the time of surgical
repair. In STEMI patients with failed PCI or with an acute coronary oc-­
clusion not amenable to PCI, emergency CABG is infrequently per-­
formed because the benefits of surgical revascularization in this
setting are less certain. [185][,][187][,][188] Because there will be a delay to reper-­
fusion with CABG in this situation, the probability of myocardial salvage
to a degree sufficient to impact on prognosis is considered low. In add-­
ition, the surgical risks of CABG in this setting may be elevated.

ESC Guidelines **3747**


*5.2.1.1. Invasive strategy in ST-elevation myocardial infarction late*

*presenters*

While routine immediate angiography and PCI (if indicated) are clearly
associated with clinical benefit in patients presenting within 12 h of
symptom onset, the value of a routine PPCI strategy in STEMI patients
presenting later than 12 h after symptom onset is less well established.

A small RCT in 347 STEMI patients presenting 12–48 h after symp-­
tom onset and without persistent symptoms reported that a routine
PPCI strategy improved myocardial salvage and long-term survival com-­
pared with conservative treatment. [189][,][190] This observation is supported
by a recent analysis of data from three nationwide observational studies
from the FAST-MI (French Registry of Acute ST-elevation and
non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction) programme, which showed a
significant lower rate of all-cause death at 1 month (2.1% vs. 7.2%)
and after a median follow-up of 58 months (30.4% vs. 78.7%) with an in-­
vasive strategy in comparison to conservative treatment. [191] However, in
stable patients with persistent occlusion of the IRA 3–28 days after MI,
the large ( *n* = 2166) Occluded Artery Trial (OAT) reported no clinical
benefit from routine coronary intervention with medical management in
comparison to medical management alone. [192][,][193] A meta-analysis of
trials testing whether late recanalization of an occluded IRA is beneficial
also showed no benefit of reperfusion. [194] Therefore, routine PCI of an
occluded IRA in STEMI patients presenting >48 h after onset of symp-­
toms and without persistent symptoms is not indicated. [192][,][193] These pa-­
tients should be managed in the same way as patients with chronic total
occlusion according to the ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and manage-­
ment of chronic coronary syndromes (CCS). [195]

**5.2.2. Immediate invasive strategy for non-ST**
**elevation acute coronary syndrome**
An immediate invasive strategy refers to emergency (i.e. as soon as pos-­
sible) angiography and PCI if indicated. This is recommended for pa-­
tients with a working diagnosis of NSTE-ACS and any of the
following very high-risk criteria:

- Haemodynamic instability or CS.

- Recurrent or ongoing chest pain refractory to medical treatment.

- Acute HF presumed secondary to ongoing myocardial ischaemia.

- Life-threatening arrhythmias or cardiac arrest after presentation.

- Mechanical complications.

- Recurrent dynamic ECG changes suggestive of ischaemia (particularly
with intermittent ST-segment elevation).

**5.2.3. Routine vs. selective invasive strategy**
A routine invasive strategy with inpatient coronary angiography is re-­
commended for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NSTEMI or a
working diagnosis of NSTE-ACS and a high index of suspicion for
UA. In patients with a working diagnosis of NSTE-ACS, multiple
RCTs comparing routine vs. selective invasive strategies have been
conducted and their results have been pooled in several metaanalyses. [196][–][200] The available evidence indicates that a routine invasive
strategy does not reduce all-cause mortality risk in the overall popula-­
tion of NSTE-ACS patients, but reduces the risk of composite ischae-­
mic endpoints, particularly in high-risk patients. A routine invasive
strategy can increase the risk of peri-procedural complications and
bleeding. However, most of the available evidence is based on old
RCTs that were conducted before the implementation of several im-­
portant developments in PCI, including radial access, modern
drug-eluting stents (DES), complete functional revascularization for


multivessel disease (MVD), improved co-adjuvant pharmacological
therapies, and contemporary biomarker assays.

*5.2.3.1. Early vs. delayed invasive strategy for non-ST elevation acute*
*coronary syndrome*

An early invasive strategy refers to routine invasive angiography (and
PCI if needed) within 24 h of presentation. This should be considered
in patients with a working diagnosis of NSTE-ACS and any of the fol-­
lowing high-risk criteria:

- A confirmed diagnosis of NSTEMI based on current recommended
ESC hs-cTn algorithms.

- Dynamic ST-segment or T wave changes.

- Transient ST-segment elevation.

- A GRACE risk score >140.

Several meta-analyses have pooled data from multiple RCTs assessing
different timing intervals of invasive angiography among NSTE-ACS pa-­
tients. None of these studies observed superiority of early invasive strat-­
egies compared with routine invasive strategies for death or non-fatal MI,
although early invasive strategies were associated with a lower risk
of recurrent/refractory ischaemia and a shorter duration of hospital
stay. [201][–][203] A collaborative meta-analysis comparing an early vs. a delayed
invasive strategy using a modified individual patient data approach ob-­
served no difference in mortality overall but a survival benefit in high-risk
patients, including those with a GRACE risk score >140 and those with
positive troponin, although tests for interaction were inconclusive. [202]

The largest meta-analysis to date (17 RCTs >10 000 patients) reported
that, in all-comers with NSTE-ACS, early ICA only significantly reduced
the risk of recurrent ischaemia and duration of stay, with no significant re-­
ductions in all-cause mortality, MI, admission for HF, or repeat revascular-­
ization. [203] The main limitation of the interpretation of meta-analyses of
these RCTs is the variability of the time to invasive angiography in the in-­
dividual trials: while invasive angiography was virtually always performed
within 24 h of randomization in the early invasive strategy groups, the
time from randomization to angiography was heterogeneous in the de-­
layed invasive groups. In many trials, delayed angiography was performed
within 24 h of randomization (albeit later than in the early angiography
arm of the respective trial). Additionally, the diagnosis of NSTEMI was
not based on the current recommended ESC hs-cTn algorithms.
Moreover, studies assessing the value of a GRACE risk score >140 to
guide the timing of ICA and revascularization in the era of hs-cTn for
the diagnosis of NSTEMI are lacking. Further detail on the interaction be-­
tween treatment effect according to GRACE score and its components in
[individual trials is provided in the Supplementary data online. Data from](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
observational studies is concordant with trial data, without a strong signal
of benefit with early versus delayed coronary angiography. [204]

A selective invasive approach after appropriate ischaemia testing or
detection of obstructive CAD by CCTA is recommended in patients
without very high- or high-risk features and a low index of suspicion
for NSTE-ACS. These patients should be managed as per the ESC
Guidelines for the management of CCS. [195] A selective invasive ap-­
proach is also appropriate for patients with NSTEMI or UA who are
not deemed good candidates for coronary angiography.

**5.2.4. Summary of invasive strategies for patients**
**with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome**

In summary, very high-risk NSTE-ACS patients are recommended to
undergo an immediate invasive strategy with emergency angiography

who meet any one of the ‘very high-risk’ NSTE-ACS criteria should undergo an immediate invasive strategy; these very high-risk criteria include haemo-­
dynamic instability or CS, recurrent or refractory chest pain despite medical treatment, life-threatening arrhythmias, mechanical complications of MI, HF
clearly related to ACS, and recurrent dynamic ST-segment or T wave changes, particularly with intermittent ST-segment elevation. Patients with
NSTE-ACS who meet any of the ‘high-risk’ criteria (confirmed NSTEMI as per the hs-cTn-based ESC algorithm, NSTE-ACS with GRACE score >140, dy-­
namic ST-segment or T wave changes, or transient ST-segment elevation) should be considered for early invasive angiography (i.e. within 24 h) and should
undergo an inpatient invasive strategy. An invasive strategy during hospital admission is recommended in NSTE-ACS patients with high-risk criteria or with a
high index of suspicion for UA. In selected patients a selective invasive strategy can also be an option. See Recommendation Table 4 for full details.


and PCI if required. High-risk NSTE-ACS patients are recommended
to undergo an inpatient invasive strategy and should be considered
for an early invasive strategy (i.e. within 24 h). For patients who do
not meet any of the very high-risk or high-risk criteria (generally


patients with clinical suspicion for NSTE-ACS and non-elevated tro-­
ponins or patients with elevated troponins not meeting the criteria
for MI), the strategy can be tailored based on the degree of clinical
suspicion. For patients with a high index of suspicion for UA, an

inpatient invasive strategy is recommended. Conversely, for patients
with a low index of suspicion, a selective invasive approach is

recommended.

**5.3. Fibrinolysis and pharmaco-invasive**
**strategy in patients with ST-elevation**
**myocardial infarction**
**5.3.1. Benefit and indication of fibrinolysis**
Fibrinolytic therapy is an important reperfusion strategy for STEMI pa-­
tients presenting within 12 h of symptom onset when PPCI cannot be
performed in a timely manner; it prevents 30 early deaths per 1000 pa-­
tients treated within 6 h of symptom onset. [205] The largest absolute treat-­
ment benefit is seen among those patients at the highest risk, including the
elderly. Successful reperfusion is generally associated with significant im-­
provement in ischaemic symptoms, ≥50% ST-segment resolution,
and haemodynamic stability. The doses of fibrinolytic agents and concomi-­
tant antithrombotic therapies are given in the Fibrinolysis and Pharmaco[invasive Strategy provided in the Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Section 6.3* .

*5.3.1.1. Pre-hospital fibrinolysis*
If trained medical or allied health staff can interpret the ECG on site, or
transmit the ECG for remote interpretation, it is recommended to ini-­
tiate fibrinolytic therapy in the pre-hospital setting. A fibrin-specific
agent (i.e. tenecteplase, alteplase, or reteplase) is the preferred agent.
The goal is to start fibrinolytic therapy within 10 min of the STEMI diag-­
nosis. Fibrinolytic therapy initiation should not be delayed by waiting for
the results of cardiac biomarker testing. In a meta-analysis of six rando-­
mized trials ( *n* = 6434), pre-hospital fibrinolysis compared with inhospital fibrinolysis reduced early mortality by 17%, particularly when
administered in the first 2 h after symptom onset. [51][,][206] These, and
more recent, data support the pre-hospital initiation of fibrinolytic
treatment when a reperfusion strategy is indicated. [145][,][207][–][209] The
STREAM (Strategic Reperfusion Early After Myocardial Infarction) trial
demonstrated that pre-hospital fibrinolysis followed by an early PCI
strategy was associated with a similar outcome to transfer for PPCI
in STEMI patients presenting within 3 h of symptom onset who could
not undergo PPCI within 1 h of FMC, although a slight excess of intra-­
cranial bleeding was observed with the investigational strategy. [184][,][210]

This excess in intracranial bleeding was blunted by halving the dose
of tenecteplase in patients >75 years of age.

*5.3.1.2. Angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention after*
*fibrinolysis (pharmaco-invasive strategy)*
It is recommended that patients should be transferred to a PCI centre
immediately after initiation of lytic therapy ( *Figure 7* ). In cases of failed
fibrinolysis or evidence of re-occlusion or re-infarction with recurrence
of ST-segment elevation, immediate angiography and rescue PCI are in-­
dicated. [185][,][211] In this setting, re-administration of fibrinolysis is not
beneficial and is discouraged. [185] Even if it is likely that fibrinolysis is suc-­
cessful (e.g. ST-segment resolution >50% at 60–90 min; typical reper-­
fusion arrhythmia; and disappearance of chest pain), routine early
angiography (i.e. within 2–24 h) is recommended. Several randomized


trials have shown that routine early angiography with subsequent PCI
(if required) after fibrinolysis reduced the rates of re-infarction and re-­
current ischaemia in comparison to a ‘watchful waiting’ strategy (i.e. a
strategy in which angiography and revascularization were performed
only in patients with spontaneous or induced severe ischaemia or LV
dysfunction, or in patients with a positive outpatient ischaemia
test). [186][,][209][,][212][–][215] A network meta-analysis including 15 357 STEMI pa-­
tients treated with fibrinolytic therapy ( *n* = 4212), PPCI ( *n* = 6139), or
fibrinolysis followed by routine immediate or early PCI ( *n* = 5006) in-­
vestigated whether STEMI patients should be transferred to a
PCI-capable facility immediately (defined as a facilitated PCI approach)
or within a day (e.g. <24 h, defined as a pharmaco-invasive ap-­
proach). [209] After PPCI, the pharmaco-invasive strategy was the second
most favourable approach, with an odds ratio (OR) for death of 0.79
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59–1.08) compared with conventional
fibrinolytic therapy. This supports the safety of transferring STEMI pa-­
tients to a PCI-capable centre for angiography within 2–24 h. The bene-­
fit of routine early PCI after fibrinolysis was demonstrated without an
increased risk of adverse events (stroke or major bleeding), and across
the spectrum of the investigated patient subgroups. [209][,][216] Therefore,
early angiography with subsequent PCI if required is the recommended
standard of care after successful fibrinolysis ( *Figure 7* ). Observational
analysis of registry data has also provided some further support for
the use of a pharmaco-invasive strategy. [130]

The optimal time delay between successful fibrinolysis and PCI has
not been clearly defined; there has been a wide variation in this time
delay in trials, ranging from a median of 1.3 to 17 h. [184][,][185][,][206][,][215][,][217]

Based on these data, a time window for PCI of 2–24 h after successful

lysis is recommended.

ment of all patients presenting with ACS. The specific choice and com-­
bination of therapy, the time of its initiation, and the treatment duration
depend on various patient and procedural factors. Treatment decisions
must be made weighing the benefits of antithrombotic therapy against
the risk of bleeding, including severe, life-threatening bleeding. [231][,][232]

Recommended anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs and their dosing
(for use during and after ACS) are summarized in *Table 6* and illustrated
in *Figure 9* .

**I. Antiplatelet drugs**

Aspirin LD of 150–300 mg orally or 75–250 mg i.v. if oral ingestion is not possible, followed by oral MD of 75–100 mg o.d.; no specific dose adjustment in

CKD patients.

**P2Y** **12** **receptor inhibitors (oral or i.v.)**

|Clopidogrel|LD of 300–600 mg orally, followed by an MD of 75 mg o.d.; no specific dose adjustment in CKD patients.<br>Fibrinolysis: at the time of fibrinolysis an initial dose of 300 mg (75 mg for patients older than 75 years of age).|
|---|---|
|Prasugrel|LD of 60 mg orally, followed by an MD of 10 mg o.d. In patients with body weight <60 kg, an MD of 5 mg o.d. is recommended. In patients aged<br>≥75 years, prasugrel should be used with caution, but a MD of 5 mg o.d. should be used if treatment is deemed necessary. No specific dose<br>adjustment in CKD patients. Prior stroke is a contraindication for prasugrel.|
|Ticagrelor|LD of 180 mg orally, followed by an MD of 90 mg b.i.d.; no specific dose adjustment in CKD patients.|
|Cangrelor|Bolus of 30 mcg/kg i.v. followed by 4 mcg/kg/min infusion for at least 2 h or the duration of the procedure (whichever is longer).<br>In the transition from cangrelor to a thienopyridine, the thienopyridine should be administered immediately after discontinuation of cangrelor<br>with an LD (clopidogrel 600 mg or prasugrel 60 mg); to avoid a potential DDI, prasugrel may also be administered 30 min before the cangrelor<br>infusion is stopped. Ticagrelor (LD 180 mg) should be administered at the time of PCI to minimize the potential gap in platelet inhibition during<br>the transition phase.|



**GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors (i.v.)**

(given at a 10-min interval) followed by an infusion of 2.0 mcg/kg/min for up to 18 h.<br>For CrCl 30–50 mL/min: first LD, 180 mcg/kg i.v. bolus (max 22.6 mg); maintenance infusion, 1 mcg/kg/min (max 7.5 mg/h). Second LD (if PCI),<br>180 mcg/kg i.v. bolus (max 22.6 mg) should be administered 10 min after the first bolus. Contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal disease<br>and with prior ICH, ischaemic stroke within 30 days, fibrinolysis, or platelet count <100 000/mm3.|
|---|---|
|Tirofiban|Bolus of 25 mcg/kg i.v. over 3 min, followed by an infusion of 0.15 mcg/kg/min for up to 18 h.<br>For CrCl ≤60 mL/min: LD, 25 mcg/kg i.v. over 5 min followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.075 mcg/kg/min continued for up to 18 h.<br>Contraindicated in patients with prior ICH, ischaemic stroke within 30 days, fibrinolysis, or platelet count <100 000/mm3.|



**II. Anticoagulant drugs**

|UFH|Initial treatment: i.v. bolus 70–100 U/kg followed by i.v. infusion titrated to achieve an aPTT of 60–80 s.<br>During PCI: 70–100 U/kg i.v. bolus or according to ACT in case of UFH pre-treatment.|
|---|---|
|Enoxaparin|Initial treatment: for treatment of ACS 1 mg/kg b.i.d. subcutaneously for a minimum of 2 days and continued until clinical stabilization. In patients<br>whose CrCl is below 30 mL per minute (by Cockcroft–Gault equation), the enoxaparin dosage should be reduced to 1 mg per kg o.d.<br>During PCI: for patients managed with PCI, if the last dose of enoxaparin was given less than 8 h before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is<br>needed. If the last s.c. administration was given more than 8 h before balloon inflation, an i.v. bolus of 0.3 mg/kg enoxaparin sodium should be<br>administered.|

**6.1. Antiplatelet therapy in the acute**
**phase**
**6.1.1. Oral antiplatelet therapy**

Antiplatelet drugs play a key role in the acute phase of treatment for
ACS. *Table 6* summarizes the dosing regimens of the available oral
and i.v. antiplatelet drugs. The choice of antiplatelet regimen should
take the bleeding risk of the patient into account. Factors associated
with an elevated bleeding risk have been detailed by the Academic
Research Consortium on High Bleeding Risk (ARC-HBR). [233] The


presence of one major or two minor ARC-HBR risk factors indicates
high bleeding risk (HBR). Of note, the presence of multiple major risk
factors is associated with a progressive increase in the bleeding risk. [234]

Aspirin treatment is started with a loading dose (LD) as soon as pos-­
sible, followed by maintenance treatment ( *Table 6* ). [235] Current evi-­
dence supports an aspirin maintenance dose (MD) of 75–100 mg
once a day (o.d.). [236][,][237]

Based on the results of the phase III PLATelet inhibition and patient
Outcomes (PLATO) and TRial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic
Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet InhibitioN with Prasugrel

ESC Guidelines **3753**


Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 38 (TRITON-TIMI 38) studies,
dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) including aspirin and a potent P2Y 12
receptor inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor) is recommended as the de-­
fault DAPT strategy for ACS patients. [238][,][239] Clopidogrel, which is char-­
acterized by less effective and more variable platelet inhibition, should
only be used when prasugrel or ticagrelor are contraindicated/not avail-­
able, or in some patients considered otherwise at HBR (e.g. ≥1 major
or ≥2 minor ARC-HBR criteria). [233][,][240][–][242] In addition, the use of clopi-­
dogrel may be considered in older patients (e.g. ≥70 years). [242][,][243]

Prasugrel should be considered in preference to ticagrelor for ACS
patients who proceed to PCI. The Intracoronary Stenting and
Antithrombotic Regimen Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment
(ISAR-REACT) 5 RCT is the largest head-to-head comparison of 1-year
DAPT with prasugrel vs. DAPT with ticagrelor in patients with ACS
planned for invasive evaluation, >80% of whom underwent PCI. [244] A
treatment strategy with prasugrel (LD given as soon as possible after ran-­
domization for patients undergoing PPCI and after delineation of coron-­
ary anatomy for patients presenting with NSTE-ACS) vs. ticagrelor (LD
given as soon as possible after randomization in all cases) significantly re-­
duced the composite endpoint of death, MI, or stroke (6.9% vs. 9.3%, *P* =
0.006) without any increase in bleeding complications (4.8% vs. 5.4%, *P* =
0.46). Limitations of this study include an open-label design and limited
data on medically managed or CABG-treated patients.

**6.1.2. Timing of loading dose of oral antiplatelet**
**therapy**

Both aspirin and oral P2Y 12 inhibitors achieve platelet inhibition more
rapidly following an oral LD. Pre-treatment refers to a strategy in which
an antiplatelet drug, usually a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor, is given before
coronary angiography and, therefore, before the coronary anatomy is
known. Although a potential benefit with pre-treatment in the setting
of ACS has been hypothesized, large-scale randomized trials supporting
a routine pre-treatment strategy with P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors are
lacking. Caution in relation to pre-treatment may be of particular rele-­
vance in patients at HBR (e.g. those receiving an oral anticoagulant

[OAC]).

*6.1.2.1. Pre-treatment in patients with suspected ST-elevation*
*myocardial infarction*

The Administration of Ticagrelor in the Cath Lab or in the Ambulance
for New ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction to Open the Coronary
Artery (ATLANTIC) trial is the only randomized study testing the
safety and efficacy of different timings of P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor initi-­
ation in patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI undergoing PPCI. [245]

In this trial, patients were randomized to receive a ticagrelor LD either
during transfer to a PPCI centre or immediately before angiography. [245]

The median difference between the timing of P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor
loading with the two treatment strategies was 31 min. In this study, the
pre-treatment strategy failed to meet the pre-specified primary end-­
point of improved ST-segment elevation resolution or Thrombolysis
In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow before intervention. Rates of major
and minor bleeding events were identical in both treatment arms.
These results were supported by real-world data obtained from the
SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-System for Enhancement and
Development of Evidence-Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated
According to Recommended Therapies) registry in STEMI patients. [246]

Prasugrel pre-treatment has not been directly investigated in patients

with STEMI.


*6.1.2.2. Pre-treatment in patients with non-ST-elevation acute*
*coronary syndrome*

The randomized A Comparison of Prasugrel at the Time of
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or as Pretreatment at the Time
of Diagnosis in Patients with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction
(ACCOAST) trial not only demonstrated a lack of benefit with respect
to ischaemic outcomes with prasugrel pre-treatment, but also a sub-­
stantially higher bleeding risk. [247] In this study, the median time from first
LD to the start of coronary angiography in the pre-treatment group
was 4.4 h. With respect to pre-treatment data for ticagrelor, the
ISAR-REACT 5 trial showed that a ticagrelor-based strategy with rou-­
tine pre-treatment was inferior to a prasugrel-based strategy with a de-­
ferred LD in NSTE-ACS patients. [244] The DUBIUS (Downstream
Versus Upstream Strategy for the Administration of P2Y12 Receptor
Blockers) trial also attempted to address this question but was stopped
early for futility as there was no difference between upstream vs. down-­
stream oral P2Y 12 administration in patients with NSTE-ACS (both
NSTEMI and UA) scheduled for coronary angiography within 72 h of
hospital admission. [248]

*6.1.2.3. Summary of pre-treatment strategies*

In patients with a working diagnosis of STEMI undergoing PPCI, pretreatment with a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor may be considered. [245] In pa-­
tients with a working diagnosis of NSTE-ACS, routine pre-treatment
with a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor before knowing the coronary anatomy
in patients anticipated to undergo an early invasive strategy (i.e. <24 h)
is not recommended. [244][,][245][,][247] For patients with a working diagnosis of
NSTE-ACS, where there is an anticipated delay to invasive angiography
(i.e. >24 h), pre-treatment with a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor may be con-­
sidered according to the bleeding risk of the patient. In all ACS patients
proceeding to PCI who did not receive P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor pretreatment, an LD is recommended at the time of PCI.

**6.1.3. Intravenous antiplatelet drugs**
Peri-interventional i.v. antiplatelet drugs include P2Y 12 receptor inhibi-­
tors (cangrelor) and glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors (eptifibatide
and tirofiban). Most of the trials evaluating GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in
PCI-treated ACS patients pre-date the era of routine DAPT, in particu-­
lar, early initiation of DAPT including an LD of a potent P2Y 12 receptor
inhibitor. [249][,][250] There is no strong evidence for any additional benefit
with the routine use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in ACS patients scheduled
for coronary angiography. Nevertheless, their use should be considered
for bailout if there is evidence of no-reflow or a thrombotic complica-­
tion during PCI. Another potential use for GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors is in the
setting of high-risk PCI in patients who have not been pre-treated with
P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors.

Cangrelor is a direct reversible, short-acting P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor
that has been evaluated during PCI for CCS and ACS in clinical trials
against clopidogrel, both with administration before (Cangrelor versus
Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet
Inhibition [CHAMPION PCI]) and after (CHAMPION PLATFORM
and CHAMPION PHOENIX [A Clinical Trial Comparing Cangrelor
to Clopidogrel Standard Therapy in Subjects Who Require
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention]) PCI. [251][–][253] A meta-analysis of
these trials showed that the benefit of cangrelor with respect to major
ischaemic endpoints was counterbalanced by an increase in minor
bleeding complications. [254] It is also important to note that the benefit
of cangrelor with respect to ischaemic endpoints was attenuated in
CHAMPION PCI with upfront administration of clopidogrel, and

**3754** ESC Guidelines


data for its use in conjunction with ticagrelor or prasugrel treatment are
limited. Due to its proven efficacy in preventing intra-procedural and
post-procedural stent thrombosis in P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor-naïve pa-­
tients, cangrelor may be considered on a case-by-case basis in P2Y 12 re-­
ceptor inhibitor-naïve ACS patients undergoing PCI, including in
patients for whom it may not be feasible to give oral drugs in the setting
of emergent PCI (e.g. CS patients and/or patients on mechanical
ventilation).

**6.2. Anticoagulant treatment in the acute**
**phase**
Anticoagulation is an important component of the initial treatment of
ACS and of the peri-procedural treatment for ACS patients managed
with an invasive strategy. Therefore, parenteral anticoagulation is re-­
commended for all ACS patients at the time of diagnosis. [255] *Table 6*
provides an overview of the relevant anticoagulant drugs and their dos-­
ing in ACS patients.

In general, a crossover between anticoagulants should be avoided in
patients with ACS (especially between unfractionated heparin [UFH]
and low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]), with the exception of
adding UFH to fondaparinux when a patient presenting with
NSTE-ACS proceeds to PCI after a period of fondaparinux treatment
(see below for further detail). [256][,][257] Anticoagulants should generally be
discontinued immediately after PCI, except in specific clinical settings
such as the confirmed presence of LV aneurysm with thrombus forma-­
tion or AF requiring anticoagulation. In addition, for bivalirudin in pa-­
tients with STEMI undergoing PCI, a full dose post-PCI infusion is

recommended.

In this section of the guideline, we summarize the recommendations
for anticoagulant treatment in the acute phase for patients with STEMI
undergoing PPCI and for patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing angiog-­
raphy (and PCI if indicated).

**6.2.1. Anticoagulation in patients with ST-elevation**
**myocardial infarction undergoing primary**
**percutaneous coronary intervention**

Unfractionated heparin has been established as the standard of care in
patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI due to its favourable risk/benefit
profile. In these patients, anticoagulation should be given during the in-­
vasive procedure. High-quality evidence with respect to the benefit of
administering anticoagulation at an earlier time point in patients under-­
going a PPCI strategy is lacking.

Alternatives to UFH that should be considered in patients with
STEMI undergoing PPCI include enoxaparin (a LMWH) and bivalirudin
(a direct thrombin inhibitor). The ATOLL (STEMI Treated With
Primary Angioplasty and Intravenous Lovenox or Unfractionated
Heparin) trial reported a reduction in the primary endpoint at 30
days (incidence of death, complication of MI, procedure failure, or ma-­
jor bleeding) with enoxaparin in comparison to UFH in patients with
STEMI undergoing PPCI. [258]

In the BivaliRudin with prolonged full-dose Infusion durinG primary
PCI versus Heparin Trial 4 (BRIGHT-4), 6016 patients with STEMI
undergoing PPCI were randomized to either bivalirudin (with a full
dose post-PCI infusion) or UFH. [259] The use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors
was restricted to patients who experienced thrombotic complications.
The primary endpoint (a composite of all-cause mortality or Bleeding
Academic Research Consortium [BARC] type 3–5 bleeding at 30
days), the individual components of the primary endpoint, and definite
or probable stent thrombosis were all significantly reduced in the


bivalirudin group. [259] Based on the totality of the available data, bivalir-­
udin with a full-dose post-PCI infusion should be considered as an alter-­
native to UFH, although further studies to confirm these findings in
non-East Asian populations are required. Bivalirudin is also the recom-­
mended alternative to UFH in patients presenting with ACS who have a
history of heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia. Additional information
[about bivalirudin, including evidence tables summarizing the relevant](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
[clinical trials, is provided in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

Based on the results of the OASIS-6 (The Safety and Efficacy of
Fondaparinux Versus Control Therapy in Patients With ST Segment
Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial, fondaparinux is not recom-­
mended in patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI. [260]

To summarize, parenteral anticoagulation is recommended for pa-­
tients with STEMI undergoing PPCI and UFH is the default choice of
anticoagulant at present. Enoxaparin and bivalirudin should be consid-­
ered as alternatives to UFH in these patients but fondaparinux is not

recommended.

**6.2.2. Anticoagulation in patients with**
**non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome**
**undergoing angiography and percutaneous coronary**
**intervention if indicated**

Patients with NSTE-ACS are also recommended to receive parenteral
anticoagulation. In patients with NSTE-ACS who are anticipated to
undergo immediate or early (i.e. <24 h from the time of diagnosis) in-­
vasive angiography and PCI if indicated, parenteral anticoagulation at
the time of diagnosis is recommended, and UFH has been historically
established as the anticoagulant of choice. However, in a meta-analysis
of trials comparing UFH with enoxaparin, mortality and major bleeding
was not different between both agents in patients with NSTE-ACS or
stable patients scheduled for PCI. [261] Therefore, enoxaparin should be
considered as an alternative to UFH in these patients (especially in cases
where monitoring of clotting times is complex).

NSTE-ACS patients who do not undergo early invasive angiography
(i.e. within 24 h of diagnosis) will have an extended initial treatment
phase consisting of only pharmacological treatment. In these patients,
fondaparinux therapy is recommended in preference to enoxaparin
while awaiting invasive angiography, based on the favourable outcomes
demonstrated with fondaparinux in comparison to enoxaparin in the
Fifth Organization to Assess Strategies in Acute Ischemic Syndromes
(OASIS-5) trial. [262] Of note, guiding catheter thrombus formation was
of concern with fondaparinux and, therefore, a full-dose bolus of
UFH should be given if the patient proceeds to PCI. The potential im-­
pact of contemporary changes in clinical practice (including radial ac-­
cess, early catheterization, and infrequent GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor
therapy) on the treatment effect observed in OASIS-5 should also be
considered. If fondaparinux is not available, enoxaparin should be con-­
sidered for these patients.

Intravenous enoxaparin should also be considered as an anticoagu-­
lant for PCI in patients with NSTE-ACS in whom subcutaneous (s.c.)
enoxaparin was used while awaiting coronary angiography. [261]

In summary, parenteral anticoagulation is recommended for patients
with NSTE-ACS. For patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing immediate
or early angiography (± PCI if indicated), UFH is recommended but en-­
oxaparin should be considered as an alternative to UFH. For patients
with NSTE-ACS who are not anticipated to undergo early angiography,
fondaparinux (with a UFH bolus at time of PCI) is recommended in
preference to enoxaparin, although enoxaparin should be considered
if fondaparinux is not available.

ESC Guidelines **3755**


**6.3. Maintenance antithrombotic therapy**
**after revascularization**

While continuation of anticoagulation after PCI is not necessary in the
vast majority of patients (i.e. those without an indication for long-term
OAC), post-interventional antiplatelet treatment is mandatory in ACS
patients. Following PCI, a default DAPT regimen consisting of a potent
P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor) and aspirin is


generally recommended for 12 months, irrespective of the stent
type, unless there are contraindications. [236][,][238][,][239][,][244][,][263] In specific clin-­
ical scenarios, the default DAPT duration can be shortened (<12
months), extended (>12 months), or modified (switching DAPT,
DAPT de-escalation). The recommended default antithrombotic treat-­
ment options for ACS patients without an indication for OAC are
shown in *Figure 10* .


















Figure 10 Recommended default antithrombotic therapy regimens in acute coronary syndrome patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation.

ACS patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation undergoing invasive evaluation. [a] Fondaparinux (plus a single bolus of UFH at the time of PCI) is
recommended in preference to enoxaparin for NSTE-ACS patients in cases of medical treatment or logistical constraints for transferring the NSTE-ACS
patient to PCI within 24 h of symptom onset. [b] Routine pre-treatment with a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor in NSTE-ACS patients in whom coronary anatomy
is not known and early invasive management (<24 h) is planned is not recommended, but pre-treatment with a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor may be considered in
NSTE-ACS patients who are not expected to undergo an early invasive strategy (<24 h) and do not have HBR. [c] Clopidogrel is recommended for 12 months
DAPT if prasugrel and ticagrelor are not available, cannot be tolerated, or are contraindicated, and may be considered in older ACS patients (typically defined
as older than 70–80 years of age).

**3756** ESC Guidelines


**6.3.1. Shortening dual antiplatelet therapy**

Several RCTs and meta-analyses have compared standard 12-month
DAPT with ≤6 months DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy in
ACS patients. [264][–][267] In some of these trials, the reduction in bleeding
events associated with abbreviated DAPT regimens came at the cost
of an increase in the rates of ischaemic complications. In a large-scale
network meta-analysis, 3-month DAPT but not 6-month DAPT was as-­
sociated with higher rates of MI or stent thrombosis in ACS patients. [264]

A number of large RCTs have investigated DAPT duration further
shortened to 1–3 months followed by P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor mono-­
therapy in patients with and without ACS. [268][–][271] In general, low to
intermediate ischaemic risk patients were included, and early mono-­
therapy with clopidogrel or ticagrelor was used. Some trials included
a comparison with more prolonged DAPT than usual in the control
arm. Patients with STEMI tended to be excluded or under-represented.

The TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High-Risk
Patients After Coronary Intervention) trial examined the effect of tica-­
grelor monotherapy vs. ticagrelor plus aspirin for 1 year after 3 months
of DAPT (ticagrelor and aspirin) on clinically relevant bleeding. This
study enrolled ‘high-risk’ patients as per the trial inclusion criteria,
which meant that the enrolled patients had at least one clinical feature
and one angiographic feature associated with a high risk of ischaemic or
bleeding events. However, in order to be randomized the patients were
also required to have not experienced a major bleeding or ischaemic
event in the 3 months following hospital discharge. [271] STEMI patients
were excluded from this study. Bleeding events (BARC type 2, 3, or
5 bleeding) were significantly reduced by omitting aspirin after 3
months, without a signal of increased ischaemic risk. A dedicated sub-­
group analysis suggested these findings were consistent in 4614 patients
with NSTEMI/UA. [272] In the TICO (Ticagrelor Monotherapy After 3

Months in the Patients Treated With New Generation Sirolimus

Stent for Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial, ticagrelor monotherapy
vs. ticagrelor plus aspirin for up to 1 year after 3 months of DAPT (ti-­
cagrelor and aspirin) was tested in 3056 ACS patients (36% STEMI). [273]

Net adverse clinical events and major bleeding events were significantly
reduced with ticagrelor monotherapy, and major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events were not significantly different. Limitations of
this study included the selected population assessed and the lower
than expected event rates. A study-level meta-analysis of outcomes
in a population of patients (with both ACS and CCS) fitted with a
DES also reported a beneficial effect of shortened DAPT for 1–3
months on major bleeding events, as well as a neutral effect on death,
MI, and stroke. [274]

The STOPDAPT-2-ACS (ShorT and OPtimal Duration of Dual
AntiPlatelet Therapy-2 Study for the Patients With ACS) trial investi-­
gated a short DAPT strategy in ACS patients. [275] At 1–2 months, pa-­
tients were randomized to either clopidogrel monotherapy or
continued DAPT for 12 months. Non-inferiority of the investigational
strategy for the composite endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) or bleeding
events was not proven, suggesting that systematic very short duration
DAPT (i.e. <3 months) followed by clopidogrel monotherapy is not a
useful strategy in ACS patients.

The MASTER DAPT (Management of High Bleeding Risk Patients Post
Bioresorbable Polymer Coated Stent Implantation With an Abbreviated
Versus Prolonged DAPT Regimen) trial examined a strategy of abbre-­
viated DAPT (1 month) followed by either aspirin or P2Y 12 inhibitor
monotherapy vs. DAPT ≥3 months (standard therapy) in a cohort of
4579 HBR patients (49% ACS, 12% STEMI) undergoing PCI with a bioab-­
sorbable polymer-coated stent. [276] Net adverse clinical events and major


adverse cardiac or cerebral events were comparable between the
groups, whereas major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events
were significantly reduced in the abbreviated therapy group.

**6.3.2. De-escalation from potent P2Y** **12** **inhibitor to**
**clopidogrel**

The need to switch between oral P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors is not
uncommon as a consequence of bleeding complications (or concern re-­
garding bleeding), non-bleeding side effects (e.g. dyspnoea on ticagrelor,
allergic reactions), and socioeconomic factors. [277][,][278] As such, switching
between oral P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors may be considered in selected

cases.

P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor de-escalation (i.e. switching from prasugrel/
ticagrelor to clopidogrel) in ACS patients may be considered as an al-­
ternative strategy to the default treatment regimen in order to reduce
the risk of bleeding events. However, it is important to note that there
is a potential risk of increased ischaemic events with de-escalation and
this strategy is not recommended in the first 30 days after the index
ACS event. In the TROPICAL-ACS (Testing Responsiveness to
Platelet Inhibition on Chronic Antiplatelet Treatment For Acute
Coronary Syndromes) trial (44% NSTE-ACS, 56% STEMI), an approach
of DAPT de-escalation from prasugrel to clopidogrel (at 2 weeks after
ACS) was guided by platelet function testing and was non-inferior to
standard treatment with prasugrel at 1 year after PCI in terms of net
clinical benefit. [279] In the Cost-effectiveness of CYP2C19 Genotype

Genetics) trial, DAPT de-escalation from ticagrelor/prasugrel to clopi-­
dogrel guided by CYP2C19 genotyping in ACS patients undergoing
PPCI within the previous 48 h was non-inferior to standard treatment
with ticagrelor or prasugrel at 12 months with respect to thrombotic
events and resulted in a lower incidence of bleeding. [280]

The single-centre TOPIC (Timing of Platelet Inhibition After Acute
Coronary Syndrome) trial used an unguided de-escalation approach in
645 ACS patients (60% NSTE-ACS, 40% STEMI) from ticagrelor/prasu-­
grel to clopidogrel after 1 month of DAPT with ticagrelor/prasugrel
and aspirin. Net adverse clinical events and bleeding events were reduced,
whereas the rate of ischaemic endpoints was unchanged. [281] The
TALOS-AMI (TicAgrelor versus CLOpidogrel in Stabilised Patients with
Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial investigated unguided de-escalation in
2697 ACS patients (46% NSTEMI/UA, 54% STEMI) from ticagrelor to clo-­
pidogrel after 1 month of DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin. [282] This uni-­
form unguided de-escalation strategy led to significant 12-month
reductions in net adverse clinical events and bleeding events. The
HOST-REDUCE-POLYTECH-ACS (Harmonizing Optimal Strategy for
Treatment of Coronary Artery Diseases Trial—Comparison of
REDUCTION of PrasugrEl Dose & POLYmer TECHnology in ACS
Patients) trial tested a different method of de-escalation—a reduction
in prasugrel dose rather than switching to clopidogrel. In this trial, 2338
low-risk ACS patients <75 years of age (14% STEMI, 25% NSTEMI, and
61% UA) were randomized to low-dose prasugrel (5 mg daily) or
standard-dose prasugrel (10 mg daily) after 1 month of DAPT with
standard-dose prasugrel. [283] Prasugrel dose de-escalation was associated
with fewer net adverse clinical events and bleeding events, mainly by re-­
ducing bleeding events without an increase in ischaemic events. It should
be noted that the TALOS-AMI and HOST-REDUCE-POLYTECH-ACS

trials only included East Asian populations.

**6.3.3. Summary of alternative antiplatelet strategies**
**to reduce bleeding risk in the first 12 months after**
**acute coronary syndrome**
Considering the totality of evidence from the scientific literature, alterna-­
tives to the default strategy of 12 months DAPT in patients with ACS in-­
clude shortening the DAPT duration to 1 or 3–6 months (depending on
the balance of bleeding and ischaemic risks) and de-escalating DAPT from
prasugrel/ticagrelor-based DAPT to clopidogrel-based DAPT. However,
it should be noted that much of the evidence on these strategies in ACS
patients is derived from trials powered primarily for bleeding outcomes,
many of which had a non-inferiority design and were, therefore, not pow-­
ered to detect potentially relevant differences in ischaemic outcomes. The
patient populations enrolled in these studies were also often relatively se-­
lected, often excluding or under-representing the highest risk ACS pa-­
tients. As such, it is important to reflect that even meta-analyses of the
available randomized evidence cannot overcome the potential selection
bias at the point of entry in the relevant randomized trials.

These important limitations explain why these strategies should at
present remain considered as alternative strategies to the default of


12 months DAPT. From a practical perspective, this means that these
strategies should not be employed as a default strategy in the wider
ACS population but can be considered when there is a specific motiv-­
ation for their use (i.e. aiming to reduce the risk of bleeding events in
HBR patients or if there are other specific concerns regarding a
12-month potent P2Y 12 inhibitor-based DAPT regimen).
De-escalation of antiplatelet therapy in the first 30 days is not recom-­
mended, but de-escalation of P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor therapy may be
considered as an alternative strategy beyond 30 days after an ACS, in
order to reduce the risk of bleeding events. DAPT abbreviation strat-­
egies (followed preferably by P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy within the
first 12 months post-ACS) should be considered in patients who are
event-free after 3–6 months of DAPT and who are not high ischaemic
risk, with the duration of DAPT guided by the ischaemic and bleeding
risks of the patient. For HBR patients, aspirin or P2Y 12 receptor inhibi-­
tor monotherapy after 1 month of DAPT may be considered. Please
see Recommendation Table 6 for full details. These alternative antipla-­
telet strategies to reduce bleeding risk in the first 12 months after ACS
are also summarized in *Figure 11* .

**3758** ESC Guidelines


To summarise, antiplatelet strategies to reduce bleeding risk in the first
12 months after an ACS can be divided into abbreviated DAPT strategies
and DAPT de-escalation strategies. Twelve-month DAPT (preferably
with prasugrel or ticagrelor) remains the default strategy for patients
with ACS ( *Figure 10* ) and these strategies should only be used as alterna-­
tives to this strategy, in general driven by a motivation to reduce the risk
of bleeding events (i.e. if the patient is HBR or if there are other specific
concerns regarding 12-month potent P2Y 12 inhibitor-based DAPT).

The specific alternative antiplatelet strategies employed (i.e. choice
of P2Y 12 inhibitor, duration of DAPT, choice of SAPT agent) to reduce
bleeding risk should be chosen based on the bleeding risk of the patient
(HBR or not) and these recommendations are summarized in

Recommendation Table 6.

**6.4. Long-term treatment**
By default, DAPT consisting of a potent P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor in add-­
ition to aspirin is recommended for a minimum of 12 months after an
ACS event; exceptions include patients for whom surgery is urgently
needed, patients in whom OAC is indicated, and patients in whom the
risk of bleeding is too high for other reasons. [238][,][239][,][263] After PCI for
ACS, ischaemic and bleeding events both markedly decrease over time.


|In patients who are event-free after 3–6 months of<br>DAPT and who are not high ischaemic risk, single<br>antiplatelet therapy (preferably with a P2Y IIa A<br>12<br>receptor inhibitor) should be considered.264,268–<br>271,273,274,276,313,320|Col2|Col3|

**6.5. Antiplatelet therapy in patients**
**requiring oral anticoagulation**
**6.5.1. Acute coronary syndrome patients requiring**
**anticoagulation**

In 6–8% of patients undergoing PCI, long-term OAC is indicated
and should also be continued during the invasive procedure.
Interruption of the long-term OAC and bridging with parenteral antic-­
oagulants may lead to an increase in thrombo-embolic episodes and
bleeds. [328][–][330] In patients undergoing PCI, it is unknown whether it is
safer to bridge non-vitamin K antagonist (VKA) OACs (NOACs) with
parenteral anticoagulants or to continue NOACs without additional
parenteral anticoagulation. In VKA-treated patients, no parenteral antic-­
oagulation is needed if the international normalized ratio (INR) is
>2.5. [311][,][331][,][332] Strategies to minimize PCI-related complications in pa-­
tients on OAC are listed in *Table 7* .

Evidence on the management of ACS patients with an indication for
long-term OAC undergoing PCI is derived from subgroups of
RCTs. [305][–][309][,][333] Patients with STEMI (who generally carry a higher
atherothrombotic risk) were under-represented (∼10% of the study
populations) in the major RCTs. [305][,][307][–][309] Pivotal trials testing the
benefit of NOACs as part of the antithrombotic regimen in patients
with an indication for long-term anticoagulation undergoing PCI are dis-­
[cussed in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

All of these trials were individually powered to address the safety of
the tested strategy with regard to bleeding events, but not to reliably as-­
sess differences in individual ischaemic endpoints. In a meta-analysis of all
four NOAC-based RCTs comparing dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT)
with triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT) in AF patients undergoing PCI
(encompassing 10 234 patients), the primary safety endpoint
(International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major or clinically
relevant non-major bleeding) was significantly lower with DAT vs. TAT
(relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% CI, 0.56–0.78; *P* <0.001). [310] There were
no significant differences in all-cause and CV death, stroke, or trialdefined major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). However, DAT
was associated with a borderline increased risk of MI (RR 1.22, 95%
CI, 0.99–1.52; *P* = 0.07) and a significant increase in stent thrombosis
(RR 1.59, 95% CI, 1.01–2.50; *P* = 0.04). This translates into an absolute
reduction in major bleeding events of 2.3% compared with an absolute
increase in stent thrombosis of 0.4%, without an effect on overall
MACE. When interpreting the results of these studies, an important gen-­
eral point is that the treatment effect is confounded by the use of

NOACs in the DAT treatment arms and VKAs in the TAT arms.

Secondary analyses from the AUGUSTUS (An Open-Label, 2 × 2
Factorial, Randomized Controlled, Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety
of Apixaban Versus Vitamin K Antagonist and Aspirin Versus Aspirin
Placebo in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and Acute Coronary
Syndrome or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) trial indicate that
the stent thrombosis rate was highest within the first 30 days after ran-­
domization, with higher rates in the non-aspirin group. [334] Aspirin treat-­
ment reduced ischaemic events (CV death, MI, stroke, stent
thrombosis) but also increased major bleeding events in the first 30
days. Aspirin treatment did not impact on ischaemic event rates after
30 days and for up to 6 months, but did increase the bleeding risk during
this time period. [334][,][335] In the MASTER DAPT trial, 4579 HBR patients
were allocated to 1 month vs. 6 months of DAPT after implantation of a
biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent; half of the patients pre-­
sented with ACS and a third were on OAC treatment. [276] A sub-analysis
of this study reported that stopping DAPT after 1 month and stopping
single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) after 6 months while maintaining


OAC was safe with respect to ischaemic events in patients taking clin-­
ically indicated long-term OAC therapy. [313]

In patients with ACS, the indication for OAC should be re-assessed
and treatment continued only if a compelling indication exists (e.g. par-­
oxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc

[Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years, Diabetes mel-­
litus, Stroke or transient ischaemic attack, Vascular disease] score ≥1 in
men and ≥2 in women; mechanical heart valve; or recent/a history of
recurrent or unprovoked deep vein thrombosis or PE). Although
they have been tested in a minority of patients in the major RCTs, in
the absence of robust safety and efficacy data, the use of prasugrel or
ticagrelor as part of TAT is not recommended. The intensity of OAC
should be carefully monitored, with a target INR of 2.0–2.5 in patients
treated with VKA (with the exception of individuals with a mechanical
prosthetic valve in the mitral position).

Overall, in patients with AF without mechanical prosthetic valves or
moderate to severe mitral stenosis, the evidence supports the use of
NOACs over VKAs as they reduce bleeding risk. DAT with a NOAC
at the recommended dose for stroke prevention and SAPT (preferably
clopidogrel, which was used in >90% of patients in the major RCTs) is
recommended as the default strategy for up to 12 months after up to 1
week of TAT (with NOAC and DAPT consisting of aspirin and clopido-­
grel) ( *Figure 12* )—the up to 1 week duration of TAT is based on the
median treatment duration in the investigational arm of the
AUGUSTUS trial. [308] Although none of the available RCTs were de-­
signed to detect differences in ischaemic events, the numerically higher
risk of stent thrombosis and MI is offset by the lower risk of bleeding,
with a resultant neutral effect on total mortality. [310][,][336][–][338]

the recommended doses for the NOACs are as follows: Apixaban 5 mg b.i.d., Dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg b.i.d., Edoxaban 60 mg o.d., Rivaroxaban 15 mg or 20
mg o.d. NOAC dose reductions are recommended in patients based on certain criteria for each of the NOACs (including renal function, body weight, concomi-­
tant medications and age). SAPT: preference for a P2Y 12 [receptor inhibitor (usually clopidogrel) over aspirin. See Bleeding risk assessment in Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

At variance with the default strategy, DAT may be shortened to 6
months by withdrawing the antiplatelet therapy in certain patients;
for example, in patients with multiple HBR factors. In patients with
high ischaemic risk or other anatomical/procedural characteristics
that outweigh the bleeding risk, TAT should be prolonged for up to
1 month, followed by DAT for up to 12 months.

There is currently limited evidence to support the use of OAC with
ticagrelor or prasugrel as DAT after ACS and/or PCI as an alternative to
TAT; ticagrelor was used in 5–12% and prasugrel in 1–2% of patients,
respectively, in the four pivotal RCTs. [305][,][307][–][309][,][339]

In medically managed ACS patients, current data support DAT over
TAT, with a single antiplatelet agent (most commonly clopidogrel) for at
least 6 months. [308] In the AUGUSTUS trial, ∼24% of enrolled patients pre-­
sented with medically managed ACS. [308] In these patients, apixaban signifi-­
cantly reduced bleeding events compared with a VKA, while no significant
differences were observed in death or ischaemic events. The use of aspirin,


in comparison to placebo, led to more bleeding events but no significant
differences in death, hospitalization, or ischaemic events were observed. [308]

Regarding the need to continue with any antiplatelet agent beyond
12 months after ACS and/or PCI in patients with an indication for
OAC, the AFIRE (Atrial Fibrillation and Ischemic Events With
Rivaroxaban in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease) trial
randomized 2236 AF patients treated with PCI or CABG more than
1 year earlier or with documented CAD to receive either rivaroxaban
monotherapy or combination therapy with rivaroxaban plus a single
antiplatelet agent. [324] Rivaroxaban monotherapy was non-inferior to
combination therapy for the primary efficacy composite endpoint of
stroke, systemic embolism, MI, UA requiring revascularization, or over-­
all death, and superior with regard to the primary safety endpoint of
major bleeding. This trial and another prematurely terminated trial sup-­
port the recommendation to stop antiplatelet therapy after 12 months
and continue with OAC monotherapy in most patients. [325]

**3762** ESC Guidelines


**6.5.2. Patients requiring vitamin K antagonists or**
**undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery**

In patients for whom a VKA is mandated (e.g. patients with mechanical
prosthetic valves), DAT with a VKA and SAPT (preferably clopidogrel)
is indicated after an up to 1-week period of TAT (with aspirin and clo-­
pidogrel). [306] A network meta-analysis has reported that compared
with TAT (consisting of VKA plus aspirin and clopidogrel), DAT
(VKA plus clopidogrel) was associated with a trend towards a reduction
in TIMI major bleeding, with no significant difference observed in
MACE. [336]

In ACS patients undergoing CABG with an established indication for
OAC, anticoagulation in combination with SAPT should be resumed
after CABG as soon as possible and TAT should be avoided.

**6.6. Antithrombotic therapy as an adjunct**
**to fibrinolysis**
ISIS-2 (Second International Study Of Infarct Survival) demonstrated
that the benefits of aspirin and fibrinolytics (i.e. streptokinase) were
additive. [340] The first dose of aspirin (162–325 mg) should be chewed
or given i.v. and a low dose (75–100 mg) given orally daily from the
next day thereafter. Clopidogrel added to aspirin reduces the risk of
CV events and overall mortality in patients treated with fibrinolysis
and should be added to aspirin following lytic therapy. [341][,][342] Based
on the available RCTs, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute
improved outcomes with ticagrelor or prasugrel in patients with STEMI
treated with thrombolytics. [343][–][345] There is no evidence that adminis-­
tration of GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors improves myocardial perfusion
or outcomes in patients treated with fibrinolysis, and it may increase
the risk of bleeding events. [346]

Parenteral anticoagulation is recommended until revascularization, if
performed. Despite an increased risk of major bleeding, the net clinical
benefit favoured enoxaparin over UFH in the ASsessment of the
Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic 3 (ASSENT 3) trial ( *n* =
6095). [347] In the large Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for
Acute myocardial infarction Treatment–Thrombolysis In Myocardial
Infarction 25 (ExTRACT–TIMI 25) trial ( *n* = 20 506), a lower dose
of enoxaparin was given to patients ≥75 years old and to those
with impaired renal function (estimated creatinine clearance
<30 mL/min). Enoxaparin was associated with a reduction in the
risk of death and re-infarction at 30 days when compared with a
weight-adjusted UFH dose, but at the cost of a significant increase
in non-cerebral bleeding complications. The net clinical benefit (i.e. ab-­
sence of death, non-fatal infarction, and intracranial haemorrhage) fa-­
voured enoxaparin. [348][,][349] In the large OASIS-6 trial, fondaparinux was
superior to placebo or UFH in preventing death and re-infarction, es-­
pecially in patients who received streptokinase. [260][,][350] In a large trial
with streptokinase, significantly fewer re-infarctions were seen with bi-­
valirudin given for 48 h compared with UFH, although at the cost of a
modest non-significant increase in non-cerebral bleeding complica-­
tions. [351] Bivalirudin has not been studied with fibrin-specific agents,
and there is no evidence to support direct thrombin inhibitors as an
adjunct to fibrinolysis. [260][,][350]

Weight-adjusted i.v. tenecteplase, low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel given
orally, and enoxaparin i.v. followed by s.c. administration until the time
of PCI (revascularization) represents the most extensively studied
antithrombotic regimen as part of a pharmaco-invasive strat-­
egy. [184][,][186][,][213][,][346][,][352] Further information on fibrinolytic therapy, includ-­
ing antithrombotic co-therapies and contraindications is provided in

**6.7. Antithrombotic therapy in patients**
**not undergoing reperfusion**
Patients with a final diagnosis of ACS who do not undergo reperfusion
should receive a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor in addition to aspirin, maintained
over 12 months unless there is HBR. Among ACS patients who are med-­
ically managed without revascularization, the combination of aspirin and ti-­
cagrelor for up to 12 months has demonstrated a benefit in comparison to
aspirin and clopidogrel. [238][,][361] The combination of aspirin and prasugrel can
also be justified in preference to aspirin and clopidogrel if coronary angiog-­
raphy has been performed and CAD is confirmed. [239][,][362] As such, potent
P2Y 12 inhibitor-based DAPT is a reasonable option for patients with a final
diagnosis of ACS not undergoing reperfusion, unless concerns over the
bleeding risk prevail (e.g. based on ARC-HBR criteria). [238][,][361] A DAPT regi-­
men based on clopidogrel and aspirin may provide a good net clinical bene-­
fit among older ACS patients. [242][,][363] Further information regarding
antithrombotic therapy in ACS patients who do not undergo reperfusion
[is provided in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

ESC Guidelines **3763**


**7.1. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in acute**
**coronary syndrome**
While a small minority of all patients with ACS present as OHCA, ACS
is the most common cause of OHCA. [364][–][366] In patients with OHCA,
resuscitation efforts should follow the European Resuscitation
Council Guidelines. [367] The majority of adult cardiac arrest cases are

associated with obstructive CAD and ACS should be included in the
differential diagnosis. [365][,][368] Therefore, ICA can be part of the postresuscitation management for patients who are estimated to have a
high probability of acute coronary occlusion (e.g. persistent
ST-segment elevation or equivalents and/or haemodynamic and/or
electrical instability). [367][,][369] Neurological status (e.g. comatose vs. noncomatose) and survival probability (i.e. favourable benefit/risk ratio vs.
futility) should also be included in the decision-making algorithm.

Despite the lack of dedicated trials, patients with return of spontan-­
eous circulation (ROSC) and persistent ST-segment elevation should, in
general, undergo a PPCI strategy (immediate ICA and PCI if indicated),
based on the overall clinical situation and a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
Based on registry reports, emergent ICA and PCI are associated with
good outcomes in this setting, particularly in patients who are noncomatose at initial assessment. [368][,][370][,][371]

The management of patients with ROSC without evidence of
ST-segment elevation should be individualized according to haemo-­
dynamic and neurological status. In OHCA with an initial shockable
rhythm and without ST-segment elevation or equivalents and without
CS, routine immediate ICA is not superior to a delayed invasive strategy
based on data from the COACT (Coronary Angiography after Cardiac
Arrest) and TOMAHAWK (Immediate Unselected Coronary
Angiography Versus Delayed Triage in Survivors of Out-of-hospital
Cardiac Arrest Without ST-segment Elevation) RCTs. [372][,][373] Smaller,
underpowered trials (EMERGE [EMERGEncy versus delayed coronary
angiogram in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with no obvious
non-cardiac cause of arrest], PEARL [A Pilot Randomized Clinical Trial
of Early Coronary Angiography Versus No Early Coronary
Angiography for Post-Cardiac Arrest Patients Without ECG ST
Segment Elevation], and COUPE [Coronariography in OUt of
hosPital Cardiac arrEst]) have also pointed to the same conclu-­
sion. [372][–][377] Further detail on these trials is provided in the
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *[Evidence Tables](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* .

Based on data from the COACT and TOMAHAWK trials, it appears
reasonable to delay ICA in haemodynamically stable patients with re-­
suscitated OHCA without ST-segment elevation or equivalents. Initial
evaluation in the ED or intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) should focus
on excluding non-coronary causes (cerebrovascular events, respiratory
failure, non-cardiogenic shock, PE, or intoxication). Echocardiography is
also useful in the evaluation of these patients. The decision to perform
selective coronary angiography (and PCI if indicated) should also con-­
sider factors associated with poor neurological outcome and the likeli-­
hood of ACS.

In patients who remain unresponsive after ROSC, monitoring of
core temperature and actively preventing fever (defined as a tempera-­
ture >37.7°C) is recommended to improve neurological out-­
come. [367][,][378][–][385] A recent study compared device-based temperature
control of 36°C for 24 h followed by targeting of 37°C for either 12
or 48 h (for total intervention times of 36 and 72 h, respectively) or un-­
til the patient regained consciousness in 789 patients with OHCA of a
presumed cardiac cause (∼45% with ST segment elevation on ECG; im-­
mediate coronary angiography performed in 92% and PCI in 43%). This
study reported comparable outcomes with both strategies with

for Cardiogenic Shock) trial. [394][–][396] While most patients will proceed to
PCI at the time of diagnostic angiography if myocardial revascularization
is indicated, surgical revascularization represents a valuable treatment
option in patients in whom attempted PCI of the IRA has failed or if
the coronary anatomy is not amenable to PCI. [395][,][397][,][398] In the presence
of CS due to AMI-related mechanical complications, surgical or percu-­
taneous treatment may also be indicated and the strategy should be

decided based on discussion between members of the Heart Team.

In the IABP-SHOCK II (Intraaortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock
II) trial, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) use was not associated with
lower 30-day mortality. [399] Therefore, in the absence of mechanical com-­
plications, the routine use of an IABP is not recommended for CS com-­
plicating AMI. The role of mechanical circulatory devices (veno-arterial
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [VA-ECMO], micro-axial
pump) in the AMI setting is not well established and large-scale rando-­
mized trials are warranted. [400][,][401] The Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation in the Therapy of Cardiogenic Shock trial randomized
122 patients (51% with STEMI) with rapidly deteriorating or severe CS
to either immediate implementation of VA-ECMO or an initially conser-­
vative strategy (which allowed for downstream use of VA-ECMO). [402]

The immediate implementation of VA-ECMO did not result in improved
clinical outcomes. [402] However, the interpretation of this trial is challen-­
ging because of the ∼40% crossover rate to VA-ECMO in the conserva-­
tive arm, the inclusion of heterogenous phenotypes of CS, and inclusion
of crossover in the combined primary endpoint. As a result of these lim-­
itations, this trial cannot adequately answer if mechanical circulatory sup-­
port (MCS) is able to reduce mortality in this setting.

It is important to note that while there is still a lack of high-quality
randomized data supporting the use of MCS in ACS patients presenting
with CS, some recent observational analyses have reported that the use
of intravascular LV assist devices may be associated with an increased
risk of adverse events in comparison to IABP in this setting, including
mortality and bleeding. [401][,][403] Therefore, while MCS may be considered
in selected patients with ACS and severe/refractory CS, caution should
be exercised in this regard until further randomized data are available.

###### **8. Management of acute coronary ** **syndrome during hospitalization**

**8.1. Coronary care unit/intensive cardiac**
**care unit**

Following reperfusion, it is recommended to admit high-risk ACS pa-­
tients (including all STEMI patients) to a coronary care unit (CCU) or
ICCU. Conditions in patients with ACS that act as acute risk modifiers
include ongoing myocardial ischaemia (e.g. failed reperfusion), acute HF
and/or hypoperfusion, CS, cardiac arrest with coma, malignant (lifethreatening) cardiac arrhythmias, high-degree atrioventricular block,
and acute renal failure (with oliguria). All ICCUs must have appropriate
diagnostic facilities to guide the delivery of pharmacological and invasive
treatment. The staff should be thoroughly familiar with the manage-­
ment of all aspects of ACS, including: arrhythmias, HF, mechanical
circulatory support, invasive and non-invasive haemodynamic monitor-­
ing (arterial and pulmonary artery pressures), respiratory monitoring,
mechanical ventilation, and temperature control. [408] The CCU/ICCU
should also be able to manage patients with renal and pulmonary dis-­
ease. The desirable organization, structure, and criteria of CCU/

ICCUs have been detailed in an ESC–Acute CardioVascular Care
Association position paper. [408]

**8.1.1. Monitoring**

It is recommended to initiate ECG monitoring as soon as possible in all
patients with ACS in order to detect life-threatening arrhythmias and al-­
low prompt defibrillation if indicated. ECG monitoring for arrhythmias
and new ST-segment elevation/depression is recommended for at least
24 h after symptom onset in all high-risk patients with ACS, including
all STEMI patients. [409] Longer monitoring could be considered in patients
at intermediate to high risk of cardiac arrhythmias (i.e. those with more
than one of the following criteria: haemodynamically unstable, presenting
with major arrhythmias, left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] <40%,
failed reperfusion, additional critical coronary stenoses of major vessels,
or complications related to PCI). Further monitoring for arrhythmias will
be dependent on the estimated risk. When a patient leaves the ICCU or
equivalent, monitoring may be continued by telemetry. It is recom-­
mended that personnel adequately equipped and trained to manage lifethreatening arrhythmias and cardiac arrest accompany patients who are
transferred between facilities during the time window in which they re-­
quire continuous rhythm monitoring. [409]

**8.1.2. Ambulation**

Early ambulation (i.e. out of bed on day 1) is recommended in the ma-­
jority of patients with ACS. This is facilitated by using radial access for

invasive management. Patients with extensive myocardial damage, HF,
hypotension, or arrhythmias may initially rest in bed before assessment
of myocardial function and clinical stabilization. Prolongation of bed rest
and limitation of physical activity may occasionally be required in pa-­
tients with large infarcts or severe complications.

**8.1.3. Length of stay in the intensive cardiac care unit**
The optimal length of stay in the ICCU and hospital should be individua-­
lized according to the patient’s clinical situation, taking into account
their baseline cardiac risk and comorbidities, baseline mental/functional
status, and social support. [410][,][411] Of note, the majority of adverse inhospital events occur early after admission and the initiation of

treatment.

**8.2. In-hospital care**
**8.2.1. Length of hospital stay**
The impact of both successful reperfusion and knowledge of the coron-­
ary anatomy (due to increasing rates of ICA) has resulted in progressive
reductions in the length of stay after ACS, alongside significant reduc-­
tions in 30-day mortality, suggesting that discharge within 72 h is not as-­
sociated with late mortality. [411][–][417] Candidates for early discharge after
PCI can be identified using simple criteria. [413][,][414] In one study, patients
meeting the following criteria were considered to be ‘low risk’ and suit-­
able for early discharge: age <70 years, LVEF >45%, one- or two-vessel
disease, successful PCI, and no persistent arrhythmias. [413] A recently
published consensus document also presents a template and flow chart
to support reasonable decision-making regarding post-procedural
length of stay for a broad spectrum of patients undergoing PCI. [418]

Early (i.e. same day) transfer to a local hospital following successful
PPCI is routine practice. This can be done safely under adequate mon-­
itoring and supervision in selected patients (i.e. patients without signs or
symptoms consistent with ongoing myocardial ischaemia, without ar-­
rhythmias, who are haemodynamically stable, who are not requiring
vasoactive or mechanical support, and who are not scheduled for fur-­
ther revascularization). [419]

**8.2.2. Risk assessment**

Early and late risk stratification soon after presentation is useful to aid
decision-making in patients presenting with ACS.

*8.2.2.1. Clinical risk assessment*

All patients with ACS (in particular, patients with STEMI) should have
an early assessment of short-term risk, including an evaluation of the ex-­
tent of myocardial damage, the achievement of successful reperfusion,
and the presence of clinical markers of high risk of further events (i.e.
older age, tachycardia, hypotension, Killip class >I, anterior MI, previous
MI, elevated initial serum creatinine, history of HF, peripheral arterial
disease or anaemia). Several risk scores have been developed based
on readily identifiable parameters in the acute phase before reperfu-­
sion. [420][,][421] A number of prognostic models that aim to estimate the
longer-term risk of all-cause mortality, or the combined risk of all-cause
mortality or MI, have also been developed. These models have been
formulated into clinical risk scores and, among these, the GRACE risk
score offers the best discriminative performance and is therefore re-­
commended for risk assessment. [48][,][421][–][425] Additional information re-­
[garding the GRACE score is provided in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)


*8.2.2.2. Imaging risk assessment*
LV dysfunction is a key prognostic factor for patients with ACS. [426] It is
recommended that the LVEF is determined before hospital discharge in
all patients with ACS. Routine echocardiography after PPCI is recom-­
mended to assess resting LV, RV, and valvular function. In addition,
echocardiography can be used to exclude early post-infarction mechan-­
ical complications and LV thrombus. In the limited number of cases in
which echocardiography is suboptimal or inconclusive, CMR may be
a valuable alternative. [427][–][431]

In patients presenting days after an acute ACS event with a com-­
pleted MI, the presence of recurrent angina or documented ischaemia
and proven viability in a large myocardial territory may help to guide the
strategy of planned revascularization of an occluded IRA. [192][,][432][,][433]

In patients with a pre-discharge LVEF of ≤40%, re-evaluation of the
LVEF 6–12 weeks after complete revascularization and optimal medical
therapy is recommended to assess the potential need for primary pre-­
vention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. [434]

Additional parameters that are measured by imaging in these patients
and that have been used as endpoints in clinical trials include: (i) infarct
size (CMR, SPECT, and positron emission tomography); (ii) myocar-­
dium at risk (SPECT, CMR); (iii) MVO (CMR); and (iv) intra-myocardial
haemorrhage (CMR). Infarct size, MVO and intra-myocardial haemor-­
rhage are predictors of both long-term mortality and HF in STEMI sur-­
vivors. [435][–][438]

*8.2.2.3. Biomarkers for risk assessment*

Beyond diagnostic utility, initial cTn levels add prognostic information in
addition to clinical and ECG variables in terms of predicting the risk of
short- and long-term mortality. While hs-cTn T and I have comparable
diagnostic accuracy, hs-cTn T has slightly greater prognostic accuracy
regarding mortality. [61][,][439][–][441] Serial measurements are useful to identify
peak levels of cTn for risk stratification purposes in patients with estab-­
lished MI. The higher the hs-cTn levels, the greater the risk of
death. [31][,][55][,][442] However, evidence is limited regarding the optimal
time points of serial hs-cTn measurement. Serum creatinine and
eGFR should also be determined in all patients with ACS because
they affect prognosis and are key elements of the GRACE risk score. [443]

Similarly, natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] and
N-terminal pro-BNP [NT-pro BNP]) provide prognostic information
in addition to cTn regarding the risk of death and acute HF, and the de-­
velopment of AF. [444] Additional information on the use of biomarkers
[for this purpose is presented in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

*8.2.2.4. Bleeding risk assessment*
Major bleeding events are associated with increased mortality in pa-­
tients with ACS. [231] Further detail on scores that may be considered
[for estimation of bleeding risk is provided in the Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
[online, including](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *[Table S12](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* .

*8.2.2.5. Integrating ischaemic and bleeding risks*

Major bleeding events affect prognosis in a similar way to spontaneous
ischaemic complications. [445][,][446] Given the trade-off between ischaemic
and bleeding risks for any antithrombotic regimen, risk scores may be
useful to tailor antithrombotic duration and intensity, in order to maxi-­
mize ischaemic protection and minimize bleeding risk in the individual
patient. Specific risk scores have been developed for patients on
DAPT following PCI, in the settings of both CCS and ACS. Further de-­
[tail on available scores is provided in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

###### **9. Technical aspects of invasive ** **strategies**

**9.1. Percutaneous coronary intervention**

**9.1.1. Vascular access**

Timely PCI with concomitant antithrombotic drugs has reduced the
ischaemic risk in patients with ACS. However, this strategy is also


associated with an increased bleeding risk, which affects prognosis
at least as much as ischaemic complications and is associated with im-­
paired survival. [448][,][449] Among patients undergoing PCI, access-related
bleeding accounts for 30–70% of total bleeding events. [450] There is
strong evidence demonstrating that reducing access-site bleeding
events with the use of radial access translates into significant clinical
benefits. [448][,][449] The largest randomized trials on this topic in patients
with ACS are the RadIal Vs femorAL access for coronary intervention
(RIVAL) trial with 7021 ACS patients and the Minimizing Adverse
Haemorrhagic Events by TRansradial Access Site and Systemic
Implementation of angioX (MATRIX) trial with 8404 ACS patients
(47.6% with STEMI). [451][,][452] These trials have demonstrated signifi-­
cantly lower rates of access site-related bleeding, surgical access
site repair, and blood transfusion with radial compared with femoral
access. In the MATRIX trial, no significant interaction was observed
between the type of ACS and the benefit associated with the radial
approach, suggesting that the results of this trial can be extended
to patients across the entire spectrum of ACS. [453] In a costeffectiveness analysis of the MATRIX trial, radial access was also as-­
sociated with significant savings in terms of quality-adjusted life years
and PCI-related costs. [454] Therefore, radial access is recommended as
the preferred approach in ACS patients undergoing invasive assess-­
ment with or without PCI. However, femoral access may still be se-­
lectively chosen instead of radial access in certain patients (i.e.
depending on the haemodynamic situation and other technical as-­
pects during the index PCI procedure).

**9.1.2. Intravascular imaging/physiology of the**
**infarct-related artery**
*9.1.2.1. Intravascular imaging*

As a diagnostic tool, intravascular imaging is useful in ACS patients
without significant obstructive CAD on coronary angiography.
Excluding an atherothrombotic cause in the main coronary arteries
for the ACS may have important clinical implications, not only for im-­
mediate invasive management but also for potentially lifelong
antithrombotic therapies. Intravascular imaging is also useful in cases
where there is ambiguity regarding the culprit lesion. Culprit lesion
ambiguity can be present in more than 30% of patients with sus-­
pected NSTE-ACS and over 10% of patients may have multiple cul-­
prit lesions. [455][,][456] The recommendations for intravascular imaging
in ACS are presented in *Figure 13* .

The role of intravascular imaging is well established as a tool to guide
and optimize PCI. Evidence in support of intravascular ultrasound
(IVUS) guidance in ACS generally derives from subgroup analyses of allcomers trials. Meta-analysis of available randomized trials confirms the
superiority of IVUS guidance in the reduction of MACE, although a de-­
finitive, large-scale, multinational trial is missing. [457][–][459] Smaller RCTs
have evaluated the role of optical coherence tomography (OCT)
[(see Supplementary data online).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) [460]

*9.1.2.2. Intravascular physiology*

Intracoronary physiology is increasingly being used in patients with
ACS to assess the haemodynamic significance of intermediate severity
non-IRA stenoses (see *Section 10* ). However, PCI of the IRA should
not be deferred based on invasive epicardial functional assessment
in patients with ACS. The coronary microcirculation begins to re-­
cover within 24 h of PPCI and acute functional assessment of the

IRA may underestimate the true haemodynamic severity of the cor-­
onary stenosis. [461] Beyond 1 week from the acute event, fractional
flow reserve (FFR) measurement has been reported to reliably predict
abnormal nuclear imaging results. [462] Additional information about the


role of intracoronary physiology in the IRA is presented in the
[Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

**9.1.3. Timing of revascularization with percutaneous**
**coronary intervention**
In some patients with ACS undergoing ICA, an initial conservative man-­
agement strategy with optimized guideline-directed medical therapy
may be considered on a case-by-case basis. The specific circumstances
include ACS patients with small calibre vessels, an occluded small side
branch, or concerns regarding non-compliance with antithrombotic

**3768** ESC Guidelines


therapy. In the context of complex CAD and anticipated complex PCI,
an initial conservative strategy in medically stabilized patients without
ongoing symptoms allows time for Heart Team discussion regarding
the optimal revascularization strategy.

**9.1.4. Balloons and stents**

New-generation DES are associated with superior safety and improved
efficacy compared with bare metal stents (BMS) and first-generation
DES. The Norwegian Coronary Stent Trial (NORSTENT)—the largest
clinical trial comparing outcomes of patients treated with newgeneration DES or BMS—reported that the primary endpoint of death
or MI was comparable in both treatment groups. Both target lesion re-­
vascularization (TLR) and stent thrombosis were reduced in the DES
group and there was no treatment effect by ACS presentation inter-­
action for the primary endpoint. [463] The COMFORTABLE-AMI
(Comparison of Biolimus Eluted From an Erodible Stent Coating
With Bare Metal Stents in Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction)
and EXAMINATION (Everolimus-Eluting Stents Versus Bare-Metal
Stents in ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trials have also
reported the clinical superiority of DES over BMS in terms of lower
rates of re-infarction, target lesion revascularization, and stent throm-­
bosis. [464][,][465] This clinical benefit was preserved at longer-term followup. [466][–][468]

A strategy of drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty without
stenting has also been proposed for patients with NSTE-ACS. In the
small, prospective, randomized, single-centre REVELATION
(REVascularization With PaclitaxEL-Coated Balloon Angioplasty
Versus Drug-Eluting Stenting in Acute Myocardial InfarcTION) trial,
DCB PCI vs. DES PCI was investigated in 120 patients undergoing
PPCI. The primary endpoint of target vessel FFR at 9 months was
not significantly different between the two groups. [469] In the small
PEPCAD NSTEMI (Bare Metal Stent Versus Drug Coated Balloon
With Provisional Stenting in Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction)
trial, 210 patients were randomized to compare a DCB with primary
stent treatment (BMS or DES). [470] During a mean follow-up period of
9.2 months, DCB treatment was non-inferior to treatment with a stent,

with a target lesion failure (primary study endpoint) rate of 3.8% vs.
6.6% ( *P* = 0.53). Given the limitations of these studies (in particular,
the relatively small sample sizes), the use of DCB in NSTE-ACS requires
further investigation in order to better inform future guideline
recommendations. [471]

**9.1.5. Embolic protection and microvascular salvage**
**strategies**
*9.1.5.1. Thrombus aspiration*
Large RCTs have failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit with routine
manual thrombus aspiration in comparison to conventional PPCI. [472][– ]

474 In an individual patient data meta-analysis, thrombus aspiration
was associated with fewer CV deaths and with more strokes or transi-­
ent ischaemic attacks in the subgroup of patients with high thrombus
burden (TIMI thrombus Grade 3). [475] However, in a sub-analysis from
TOTAL (a Trial of routine aspiration ThrOmbecTomy with PCI vs.
PCI ALone in patients with STEMI), routine thrombus aspiration did
not improve outcomes at 1 year and was also associated with an in-­
creased rate of stroke in patients with high thrombus burden. [476] In pa-­
tients with NSTE-ACS and thrombus-containing lesions, PCI with
adjunctive thrombus aspiration was not associated with a reduction
in MVO 4 days after the index procedure or with fewer MACE after
up to 1 year of follow-up. [477] Based on these data, routine thrombus


aspiration is not recommended, but in cases of large residual thrombus
burden after opening the vessel with a guide wire or a balloon, throm-­
bus aspiration may be considered.

*9.1.5.2. Interventions to protect the microcirculation*
The damage inflicted on the myocardium during AMI is the result of is-­
chaemia and subsequent reperfusion (ischaemia/reperfusion injury). In
patient-level pooled analyses, infarct size and MVO are independent
predictors of long-term mortality and HF in survivors of
STEMI. [436][,][478] Strategies to reduce ischaemia/reperfusion injury in gen-­
eral (and MVO in particular) remain an unmet clinical need. Further in-­
formation regarding interventions to protect the microcirculation that
are under clinical or experimental investigation is presented in the
[Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

**9.2. Coronary artery bypass grafting**
**9.2.1. Indication and timing of coronary artery bypass**
**grafting in acute coronary syndrome patients**
There are no dedicated RCTs comparing percutaneous vs. surgical re-­
vascularization in patients with ACS. In the setting of STEMI, CABG
should be considered only when PPCI is not feasible, particularly in
the presence of ongoing ischaemia or large areas of jeopardized
myocardium. [479]

In patients requiring immediate revascularization in the setting of
very high-risk NSTE-ACS, PCI is usually preferred for reasons of time-­
liness, unless concomitant mechanical complications dictate a prefer-­
ence for surgical intervention.

In other patients with ACS, the choice of revascularization modality
should be made according to the number of diseased vessels and the gen-­
eral principles of myocardial revascularization. [250] In patients with MVD,
the choice of revascularization modality will be influenced by the overall
anatomical disease complexity and the presence of comorbidities (includ-­
ing diabetes) in patients with low predicted surgical risk and mortality who
are considered suitable for either modality. This is based on data from two
large-scale individual patient meta-analyses. [480][,][481]

**9.2.2. Technical considerations specific to acute**
**coronary syndrome patients**
The patient profile, including the need for emergency or extremely ex-­
peditious revascularization, may influence both the technique of CABG
(including on-pump beating heart CABG) and the choice and use of
CABG conduits. The need for prompt surgical revascularization in
emergency circumstances does not facilitate the use of full arterial re-­
vascularization due to the prolonged period required for graft harvest-­
ing. Accordingly, the use of total venous graft-based CABG or the use
of single left internal mammary artery plus additional venous grafts may
be useful in this setting. [397]

**9.3. Spontaneous coronary artery**
**dissection**

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent cause
of ACS in general but accounts for a significant proportion of ACS cases
in young/middle-aged women. [482] The pathophysiology underlying SCAD
is different to that of Type 1 MI and there are some differences in its man-­
agement and outcomes. For these reasons, it is of paramount importance
that an accurate diagnosis is established. Until evidence from ongoing
prospective trials becomes available, patients with SCAD should receive
the same pharmacological therapy as other ACS patients. [483]

ESC Guidelines **3769**


**9.3.1. Intravascular imaging**

There are no RCTs to guide management strategies in patients with
SCAD. The use of intravascular imaging is based on observations re-­
ported from clinical cohort studies and expert opinion. [482][,][484][,][485] In
cases of diagnostic uncertainty after angiography, the use of intracor-­
onary imaging with OCT or IVUS has to be carefully considered.
There should be sufficient diagnostic uncertainty to justify coronary
instrumentation, and even if this is the case, other factors like vessel
tortuosity, vessel diameter, and a distal lesion location may prohibi-­
tively increase the risk. [482] If the decision is made to perform intravas-­
cular imaging, it is imperative to ensure the guide wire is located within
the true lumen of the coronary artery before advancing the imaging
catheter. [482] In patients with a diagnosis of SCAD on angiography
and a plan for medical therapy, additional coronary instrumentation
and intravascular imaging is not recommended on safety
grounds. [482][,][484][,][485]

**9.3.2. Revascularization**

Conservative medical management, as opposed to PCI, is generally re-­
commended for patients with SCAD. [482] In an international case series,
coronary complications following PCI occurred in >30% of pa-­
tients. [486][–][488] In a pooled analysis of three SCAD-PCI cohorts including
215 patients (94% female) drawn from Dutch, Spanish, and UK regis-­
tries, and a matched cohort of conservatively managed SCAD patients
( *n* = 221), PCI was associated with complications in ≈40% of cases (in-­
cluding 13% with serious complications). PCI is recommended only for
SCAD with associated symptoms and signs of ongoing myocardial is-­
chaemia, a large area of myocardium in jeopardy, and reduced ante-­
grade flow. Useful strategies for these patients may include minimal
plain balloon angioplasty to restore flow, followed by a conservative
strategy, targeted stenting to seal the proximal and distal ends of the
dissection, and/or extended stent lengths to prevent propagation of
the haematoma. In patients with SCAD, CABG is recommended
when dissection affects the left main or two proximal vessels, if PCI
is not feasible or unsuccessful, and if there are symptoms and signs of
ongoing myocardial ischaemia. In a small observational study, patients
with SCAD treated with CABG had favourable early clinical outcomes,
with an event rate up to 5 years similar to that of patients treated con-­
servatively, despite a significant (68%) rate of graft occlusion at 5
years. [486] The rate of graft occlusion over time can be explained by
the fact that CABG in these patients may be technically challenging as
the dissected coronary artery is more prone to anastomosis failure,
and because spontaneous healing over time may restore the flow in
the anastomosed vessel. [486][,][489] For this reason, vein grafts should be
considered in these patients in order to preserve arterial conduits for
future use. [485]

###### **10. Management of patients with ** **multivessel disease**

Approximately half of ACS patients have coronary MVD. [500]

Management of non-IRA disease varies depending on the clinical
setting.

**10.1. Management of multivessel disease in**
**acute coronary syndrome complicated by**
**cardiogenic shock**
Cardiogenic shock may occur in up to 4–11% of ACS patients, and oc-­
curs more frequently in the presence of complete coronary occlu-­
sion. [501][,][502] Ischaemia-related HF, acute severe mitral regurgitation,
and mechanical complications are the major precipitating causes of
CS in ACS. Irrespective of the mode of presentation (i.e. with or with-­
out ST-segment elevation or equivalent ECG patterns), these patients
should be transferred as soon as possible to a tertiary care centre (e.g. a
shock centre) where ICA can be performed, supported by specialists
with relevant experience (the Shock Team). [503][,][504]

In the SHOCK trial, which compared emergency revascularization
with initial medical stabilization in 302 patients with acute MI compli-­
cated by CS, ∼60% had anterior MI and 85% had MVD. [394] Among
the patients assigned to emergency revascularization, 64% underwent
PCI and 36% underwent CABG. There were no differences in mortality
at 30 days (primary endpoint), but at 6 months mortality was lower in
the group assigned to revascularization than in the group assigned to
medical therapy. Based on this evidence, immediate coronary angiog-­
raphy, and PCI if feasible, is recommended in patients with acute MI
complicated by CS. In patients with coronary anatomy unsuitable for
PCI, emergency CABG is recommended. [394]

Nearly 80% of ACS patients with CS have MVD. Based on the Culprit

procedure should be restricted to the IRA only. [404] In the
CULPRIT-SHOCK trial, IRA-only PCI was associated with a significant
reduction in all-cause death or renal replacement therapy at 30-day
follow-up (RR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.71–0.96). [404] At 1-year follow-up, mortal-­
ity did not differ significantly between the two groups. [505]

For patients undergoing emergency CABG, appropriate perioperative strategies (particularly in relation to prophylactic or ondemand mechanical circulatory support) may be considered based on
pre-operative clinical status (e.g. age, comorbidities, electrical instability,
the extent of jeopardized myocardium, the duration of ischaemia from
the time of symptom onset, right ventricular involvement, and the feasi-­
bility of cardiac surgery from technical/logistical perspectives). *Figure 14*
shows the algorithm for the management of patients with ACS and

MVD.


**10.2. Patients with multivessel coronary**
**artery disease undergoing primary**
**percutaneous coronary intervention**
Multivessel disease is evident in approximately half of patients undergo-­
ing PPCI and is associated with an adverse prognosis. [506][,][507]

Over the past decade, a series of RCTs have provided clinical evidence
that supports preventive revascularization of non-IRA after successful
PPCI of the IRA. The pivotal clinical trials (in chronological order) include
PRAMI (Preventive Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction), CvLPRIT
(Complete versus Lesion-only Primary PCI Trial), DANAMI-3–
PRIMULTI (Third Danish Study of Optimal Acute Treatment of
Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction—Primary
PCI in Multivessel Disease), COMPARE-ACUTE (Comparison

Between FFR Guided Revascularization Versus Conventional Strategy in
Acute STEMI Patients With MVD), and COMPLETE (Complete vs.
Culprit-only Revascularization to Treat Multivessel Disease After Early
PCI for STEMI) (further details on these trials is provided in the
[Supplementary data online evidence tables).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) [508][–][511]

In a systematic review of 10 randomized trials that included 7030 pa-­
tients with STEMI and MVD, complete revascularization was associated
with reduced CV mortality compared with IRA-only PCI. [512] All-cause
mortality was comparable in both groups. Complete revascularization
was also associated with a reduced composite of CV death or new MI, sup-­
porting complete revascularization in patients with STEMI and MVD. [512]

**10.3. Timing of non-infarct-related artery**
**revascularization in acute coronary**
**syndrome**
**10.3.1. Patients presenting with ST-elevation**
**myocardial infarction and multivessel coronary**
**artery disease**
The previous ESC STEMI Guidelines recommended non-IRA PCI dur-­
ing the index procedure. The primary rationale for this recommenda-­
tion was that all trials available until then had performed MVD PCI in
that time frame. However, in the COMPLETE trial, non-IRA PCI in pa-­
tients allocated to complete revascularization was performed either
during hospitalization (67% of cases) or after discharge (33% of cases),
at a mean time of 23 days after discharge but always within 45 days. [511]

No treatment effect by timing of PCI interaction was observed. Given
that the optimal timing of revascularization (immediate vs. staged) has
still not been investigated in adequately sized randomized trials with a
superiority design, no recommendation in favour of an immediate vs.
a staged (i.e. either during index hospitalization or within 45 days of dis-­
charge) non-IRA PCI strategy can be formulated. No surgical studies
have specifically investigated non-IRA revascularization.

**10.3.2. Patients presenting with non-ST-elevation**
**acute coronary syndrome and multivessel coronary**
**artery disease**

While there are a large number of studies providing evidence for patients
presenting with STEMI and MVD, there are fewer data guiding the man-­
agement of patients presenting with NSTE-ACS and MVD. [513] Currently,
there is no dedicated trial comparing complete revascularization against
IRA-only PCI for these patients. Observational studies and meta-analyses
of non-randomized studies suggest that complete revascularization is as-­
sociated with fewer deaths and MACE during follow-up in comparison to
IRA-only PCI. [514][,][515] However, given that these are analyses of treatment
effects based on non-randomized studies, the results should be consid-­
ered as hypothesis-generating at best and this remains a gap in evidence.

**10.4. Evaluation of non-infarct-related**
**artery stenosis severity (angiography vs.**
**physiology)**
Overestimation of the severity of non-IRA lesions during the PPCI proced-­
ure when assessed by quantitative coronary angiography as compared
with a repeated angiogram performed within 9 months has been re-­
ported. [516] Microvascular constriction may also occur in the non-IRAs,
leading to some variation in functional measurements between baseline
and follow-up, although the impact on decision-making may be mo-­
dest. [517][–][520] A sub-analysis of the FAME (Fractional Flow Reserve versus


Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) trial reported that 65% of lesions
in the angiographic severity range of 50–70% diameter stenosis, and 20% of
lesions in the range 71–90%, have an FFR value above 0.80. [521]

The PRIME-FFR registry included 533 ACS patients and reported that
systematic FFR measurement led to a change in the management strategy
in 38% of cases (e.g. from CABG to PCI or to medical treatment), without
an impact on MACE, death/MI, or angina symptoms at 1 year. [522] A sub-­
group analysis of the FAME trial in 328 patients with ACS (UA or
NSTEMI) and MVD reported that the adoption of FFR to guide PCI re-­
sulted in similar risk reductions of MACE compared with patients with
stable angina, with a lower number of stents implanted and less contrast
media use. [523] The FAMOUS-NSTEMI (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus
Angiographically Guided Management to Optimise Outcomes in
Unstable Coronary Syndromes) trial randomized 350 patients with
NSTE-ACS and at least one coronary stenosis (with diameter stenosis
>30%) to either angiography-guided or FFR-guided management (medical
therapy, PCI, or CABG), and demonstrated that a higher proportion of
patients in the FFR-guided management group were initially treated
with medical therapy. The FLOWER-MI (Flow Evaluation to Guide
Revascularization in Multivessel ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) study
randomized 1171 patients undergoing PPCI with MVD to complete re-­
vascularization guided by FFR or angiography. Compared with an
angiography-guided approach, an FFR-guided strategy did not reduce
the risk of death, MI, or urgent revascularization at 1 year. [524] PCI was per-­
formed in 66.2% of patients in the FFR-guided group and in 97.1% of the
angiography-guided group. In FLOWER-MI, complete revascularization
during the index procedure was only performed in 4% of patients in
both groups, and functional evaluation was mainly undertaken at the
time of the second procedure. [524] However, based on the study design,
complete revascularization could also be performed during a separate
staged procedure as early as possible before hospital discharge and within
5 days of the initial procedure.

A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs (including 3031 patients undergoing PPCI)
assessed outcomes in patients with complete revascularization vs.
IRA-only PCI according to whether the decision to carry out non-IRA
preventive PCI was based on angiography alone or on angiography plus
FFR. [525] Preventive PCI of the non-IRA was associated with a significant
reduction in cardiac death and non-fatal MI only when the decision to
proceed with non-IRA PCI was based solely on angiography. Similar find-­
ings were reported in another meta-analysis of seven RCTs including a
total of 6597 patients undergoing PPCI. [526] In patients randomised to
the complete revascularization arm, an angiography-guided strategy
(≥70% diameter stenosis) for non-IRA lesions was associated with lower
rates of recurrent MI, whereas an FFR-guided (≤0.80 for lesions with
≤90% diameter stenosis) guided approach was not. In another
meta-analysis, which pre-dated the FLOWER-MI trial, there was no het-­
erogeneity in the primary outcome when complete revascularization was
performed using an FFR-guided strategy (OR 0.78, 95% CI, 0.43–1.44) or
an angiography-guided strategy (OR 0.61, 95% CI, 0.38–0.97; *P* = 0.52 for
interaction). [512] A pooled *post-hoc* patient-level analysis of three RCTs
(FAME, DANAMI-3–PRIMULTI, and FAMOUS-NSTEMI) in ACS pa-­
tients treated with a functionally complete revascularization strategy
(i.e. PCI of the stenosis with FFR ≤0.80, deferral to medical therapy sten-­
osis with FFR >0.80) reported that the residual SYNTAX score (a proxy
of the residual coronary stenosis deferred to medical therapy) was not
associated with MACE at 2 years, suggesting that it may be safe to defer
the management of functionally non-significant stenoses in the
non-IRA. [527] The FRAME AMI (FFR Versus Angiography-Guided
Strategy for Management of AMI With Multivessel Disease) trial com-­
pared selective PCI guided by FFR (PCI if FFR ≤0.80) to routine PCI

**3772** ESC Guidelines


guided by angiography (PCI if diameter stenosis >50%) of the non-IRA(s)
in patients presenting with AMI who had undergone successful PCI of the
IRA (47% STEMI, 53% NSTEMI). [528] This study reported that at a median
follow-up of 3.5 years, the primary endpoint (death, MI, or repeat revas-­
cularization) occurred less frequently in patients randomized to the

Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries
(MINOCA) refers to the clinical situation when a patient presents
with symptoms suggestive of ACS, demonstrates troponin elevation,
and has non-obstructive coronary arteries at the time of coronary angi-­
ography (defined as coronary artery stenosis <50% in any major epicar-­
dial vessel). The reported prevalence of MINOCA varies widely across
studies (from around 1% to 14% of patients with ACS undergoing angi-­
ography). [533] MINOCA can be considered as an umbrella term that en-­
compasses a heterogeneous group of underlying causes. This includes
both coronary and non-coronary pathologies, with the latter including
both cardiac and extra-cardiac disorders ( *Figure 15* ). [4][,][18][,][534][–][537]

ESC Guidelines **3773**




Figure 15 Underlying causes for patients with a working diagnosis of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries. This figure outlines
some of the potential differential diagnoses in patients with a working diagnosis of MINOCA after coronary angiography, but this list is not exhaustive.


When a diagnosis is not established following coronary angiography,
MINOCA represents a working diagnosis as opposed to a final diagno-­
sis. It is vital for clinicians to perform further assessments and investiga-­
tions to establish the underlying cause of the MINOCA, which will allow
a final diagnosis to be established and patients to be managed appropri-­
ately. Failure to identify the underlying cause of MINOCA may result in
inadequate or inappropriate therapy.

ICA is the recommended definitive diagnostic test for ACS pa-­
tients. If the underlying cause of MINOCA is not established using


ICA alone, further evaluation using left ventriculography (including
measurement of LV end-diastolic pressure), functional assessment
with measurement of microvascular function/coronary reactivity,
and intravascular imaging can be useful to identify the underlying
cause. [456][,][538][,][539] The term ‘functional coronary angiography’ refers
to the combination of coronary angiography with adjunctive tests
(e.g. testing for coronary microvascular dysfunction and vasoreactiv-­
ity) ( *Figure 16* ).

In this context, when nonobstructive coronary arteries are identified then further assessment should be considered. When patients are subsequently admitted to the ward then in-­
vestigations as shown in **(2)** should be considered. Patients presenting with NSTE-ACS or UA are often stabilized on the ward **(2)** prior to transfer to the
cath lab **(1)** . In this context the order in which the investigations are carried out will vary depending on the location these patients are managed during first
contact. MINOCA patients require follow-up review **(3)** and may require repeat assessment using echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, de-­
pending on the initial findings. [a] Options for adjunctive tests. Patients will not require all investigations but instead the appropriate tests should be selected
based on their presentation and clinical course. [b] Examples of potential blood tests include: full blood count, renal profile, troponin, C-reactive protein,
D-dimer, NT-pro BNP. [c] A CT scan of the brain should be considered if a cranial pathology (i.e. intracranial bleed) is suspected that might have resulted

in ST elevation.

ESC Guidelines **3775**


If the underlying cause of MINOCA is not established using functional
coronary angiography, then non-invasive imaging (i.e. echocardiog-­
raphy, CMR, CT) is recommended, as clinically appropriate. CMR is
one of the key diagnostic tools to determine the underlying cause of
MINOCA. [540][–][544] CMR can identify the underlying cause in up to 87%
of patients with a working diagnosis of MINOCA and should be per-­
formed as soon as possible after presentation in these patients to maxi-­
mize its diagnostic yield, ideally during the index admission. [545]

Diagnosis of the underlying cause of MINOCA will enable the appro-­
priate treatment to be initiated based on the final diagnosis. Secondary
prevention therapies should be considered for those with evidence of
coronary atherosclerotic disease and to control risk factors. The man-­
agement of takotsubo syndrome is not informed by any prospective
RCTs, and treatment is largely supportive and empiric. [546][,][547] The treat-­
ment of patients with myocarditis has been covered by previous ESC
documents. [548][,][549] Ischemia with non-obstructive coronary arteries
(INOCA) has also been described in the context of CCS. [550][,][551]

###### **12. Special situations**

**12.1. Type 2 myocardial infarction and**
**acute myocardial injury**
Pathological processes other than atherothrombosis commonly under-­
lie the presentation of patients with acute chest pain with troponin ele-­
vation. These include Type 2 MI and myocardial injury as defined in the
fourth universal definition of MI. [1] Type 2 MI is an ischaemic myocardial
injury in the context of a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand
that is not related to acute coronary atherothrombosis. This may occur
in the context of atherosclerosis and an oxygen supply/demand imbal-­
ance, with an oxygen supply/demand imbalance alone, secondary to
vasospasm or coronary microvascular dysfunction, or secondary to
non-atherosclerotic coronary dissection. These causes of Type 2 MI
can be divided into those with underlying coronary (e.g. coronary em-­
bolus, dissection, spasm, microvascular dysfunction) or non-coronary


mechanisms (supply demand mismatch due to hypoxia, hypotension,
anaemia, tachycardia, bradycardia). [1] Type 2 MI is common and asso-­
ciated with a prognosis similar to Type 1 MI. [12]

Myocardial injury is characterized by myocyte necrosis and tropo-­
nin elevation due to mechanisms other than myocardial ischaemia and
can be acute (e.g. sepsis, myocarditis, takotsubo) or chronic (e.g. HF,
cardiomyopathies, severe valve heart disease). Myocardial injury is in-­
creasingly appreciated in the era of hs-cTn assays, which are not spe-­
cific for MI. In patients who have elevated hs-cTn values and do not
have evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia, a diagnosis of myocar-­
dial injury can be made. It is important to recognize that this diagnosis
can change if subsequent investigations indicate that the patient meets

the criteria for MI.

Despite some common risk factors, the pathophysiology of Type 2
MI is different to that of Type 1 MI. Therefore, the natural history and
appropriate management strategy of these two conditions also differs
in some important respects. Type 2 and Type 1 MI require diagnostic
distinction, which is best achieved by following an algorithmic ap-­
proach. [1][,][553] Once patients with suspected Type 2 MI and myocardial
injury have been stabilized and any precipitating illnesses have been
treated, targeted echocardiography and/or coronary angiography (in-­
vasive or CCTA) can be used to identify contributory (and prognos-­
tically important) cardiac conditions and to guide appropriate
long-term cardiovascular treatments. [12] Due to the lack of robust sci-­
entific evidence investigating management strategies and the wide
range of precipitating causes, there are currently no specific recom-­
mended pharmacological interventions for patients with Type 2 MI.
Therefore, management should instead focus on identifying and treat-­
ing any precipitating conditions (e.g. anaemia, hypoxia) alongside strict

control of CV risk factors.

**12.2. Complications**

**12.2.1. Heart failure**

Acute HF may occur as a complication of ACS. Acute HF as a result of
ACS significantly increases the risk of other in-hospital complications,
including worsening of renal function, respiratory failure, pneumonia,
and death. *De novo* acute HF complicating ACS should be distinguished
from pre-existing HF exacerbated by ACS. [554][–][556] This can be challen-­
ging and the presence of acute HF may impede the straightforward
diagnosis of ACS. Patients with ACS and acute HF are more likely to
present with resting dyspnoea and clinical signs/symptoms of fluid over-­
load. In some clinical scenarios, increased troponin levels in patients
with acute HF may reflect myocardial injury due to HF rather than myo-­
cardial necrosis due to ischaemia.

Patients with ACS complicated by acute HF require urgent and coordinated management of both conditions. The management of acute

HF should follow current recommendations included in the ESC
Guidelines on HF and ancillary documents. [557][–][559] The use of diuretics,
vasodilators, inotropic agents, and vasopressors should be considered
according to the established algorithms. Mechanical circulatory support
may also be considered in selected cases. Invasive respiratory support
and/or renal replacement therapy may be required in some circum-­
stances. [557][–][559]

Patients presenting with acute HF (including patients with CS) com-­
plicating ACS require immediate ICA. [250][,][394][,][396] These patients should
also undergo emergency echocardiography/chest ultrasonography to
gather information about LV and RV function, regional wall motion ab-­
normalities, valvular function, and possible mechanical complica-­
tions. [250][,][557][,][560] In patients with ACS, CS may occur as a result of

**3776** ESC Guidelines


extensive ischaemia due to MVD, acute severe mitral regurgitation, and
mechanical complications. Patients with ACS and CS should be trans-­
ferred as soon as possible to a PCI centre where immediate coronary
angiography, and PCI of the IRA if needed, can be performed. [404][,][505] In
patients with CS complicating ACS in whom the coronary anatomy is
not suitable for PCI, emergency CABG is recommended.
Management of MVD in this context is detailed in *Section 10* .

The clinical benefit of percutaneous MCS devices and/or VA-ECMO
in the context of ACS remains unclear. [402][,][561] Micro-axial MCS devices

have not been associated with lower 30-day mortality in comparison to
IABP in observational studies. [400] In a large retrospective registry of 48
306 patients (>80% ACS) undergoing PCI with MCS, micro-axial MCS
support was associated with higher mortality and bleeding rates in com-­
parison to IABP. [562] Similar results were observed in another
propensity-matched registry analysis confined to patients with CS,
where micro-axial MCS support was also associated with more compli-­
cations and higher mortality than IABP. [563] In the IABP-SHOCK II trial,
the routine use of IABP in patients with ACS and CS did not reduce
30-day, 1-year, or 6-year mortality. [399][,][405][,][407] Based on these data, a
benefit of LVAD in patients with ACS has not been demonstrated,
and given that observational data have suggested that this may be asso-­
ciated with harm, caution is advised in this regard until further RCT evi-­
dence is available.

**12.2.2. Mechanical complications**
Mechanical complications may occur in the first days following MI,
most commonly in patients presenting with STEMI. The incidence
of mechanical complications has fallen significantly in the era of
PPCI. [564] A recent large epidemiological investigation including almost
9 million ACS patients reported an overall prevalence of mechanical
complications in 0.27% of STEMI cases and 0.06% of NSTEMI cases,
with in-hospital mortality rates of 42.4% and 18%, respectively. [564]

Mechanical complications are life-threatening and therefore require
[prompt identification and management (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
*[Table S14](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* ). Sudden hypotension, the recurrence of chest pain, new
cardiac murmurs suggestive of acute mitral regurgitation or a ven-­
tricular septal defect, pulmonary congestion, or jugular vein distension
should raise suspicion of a mechanical complication. Immediate echo-­
cardiographic assessment is indicated when mechanical complications
are suspected.

The use of temporary MCS for mechanical complications, either to
improve pre-operative clinical/haemodynamic status or prophylactical-­
ly, represents a new trend in management. However, this approach re-­
quires more data and evidence in order to determine if it provides a
clinical benefit. [565][–][568] Surgery is currently regarded as the treatment
of choice for patients with ACS and mechanical complications, although
percutaneous strategies are occasionally used in selected candidates
with a prohibitive risk profile or contraindications to a surgical ap-­
proach. [569][–][572] A multidisciplinary approach to the management of
these patients is of paramount importance, and should apply to all
stages of care, from the initial stabilization of the patient to discussion
and application of the therapeutic strategy, including palliative
care. [573][,][574] Patients with ACS-related mechanical complications should
be considered for IABP while awaiting surgery.

**12.2.3. Left ventricular thrombus**

While the incidence of LV thrombus following AMI has declined due to
advances in reperfusion and antithrombotic therapies, it remains


relatively common, particularly following anterior STEMI, where it
can be present in >9% of patients according to a large
meta-analysis. [575][,][576]

Echocardiography remains the first-line imaging test for the detec-­
tion of LV thrombus. In patients where the apex is not well visualized
on regular echocardiography, contrast echocardiography may be con-­
sidered for improved image quality. CMR is the gold standard imaging
modality for the diagnosis and assessment of LV thrombi.
Contemporary CMR data report LV thrombi in up to 6.3% of all
STEMI patients and in 12.2% of those with anterior STEMI, suggesting
that the incidence of LV thrombi may be underestimated with echocar-­
diography. [577] Patients with LV thrombi that were not evident on echo-­
cardiography but were detected by CMR appear to have similar clinical
outcomes to patients with LV thrombi that were evident on echocar-­
diography. [578] Therefore, CMR should be considered in patients with
equivocal echocardiographic images or in patients considered to be
at a particularly high risk of LV thrombus.

The timing of imaging for LV thrombus may also be relevant, given
that the identification of LV thrombus has been reported to increase
in the first 2 weeks post-MI. [579] While more contemporary data are re-­
quired, these data suggest that a high proportion of LV thrombi may
develop following hospital discharge, indicating that delayed imaging
at 2 weeks in high-risk patients may be of value.

Once an LV thrombus has been diagnosed, OAC therapy (warfarin
or NOAC) should be considered for 3–6 months, guided by repeated
echocardiography or CMR and with consideration of bleeding risk
and the need for concomitant antiplatelet therapy. [580][,][581] However,
there are a lack of prospective randomized data on the optimal antic-­
oagulation regimen, anticoagulation duration, and the combination of
oral anticoagulation with antiplatelet agents in patients with LV
thrombus following MI. [581] The choice of therapy should be tailored
to the patient’s clinical status and the results of follow-up
investigations.

**12.2.4. Post-acute coronary syndrome pericarditis**

Pericardial complications that may develop after an AMI include early
infarct-associated pericarditis (occurring from a few hours to 4 days
after AMI, mostly transient), late pericarditis or post-cardiac injury
(Dressler) syndrome (typically occurring 1–2 weeks after AMI), and
pericardial effusion. [548][,][582] This topic is discussed further in the
[Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

**12.2.5. Arrhythmias**
*12.2.5.1. Atrial fibrillation*
Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent supraventricular arrhythmia in pa-­
tients with ACS. [583] AF may be pre-existing, first time detected, or of
new onset during ACS management. Patients with AF have a greater
number of comorbidities compared with patients without AF and are
at higher risk of complications. [584] In most cases, AF is well tolerated
and no specific treatment is required, apart from anticoagulation. [585]

Prompt treatment is required for AF causing acute haemodynamic in-­
stability, with electrical cardioversion being the preferred approach.
Adequate rate control can be achieved by administration of betablockers depending on the presence of HF and low ejection fraction.
For patients with depressed LVEF, amiodarone or digoxin could be
used (preferably amiodarone). In cases of hypotension, digoxin is pre-­
ferred over amiodarone or beta-blockers. Patients with AF and risk fac-­
tors for thrombo-embolism should be adequately treated with chronic
oral anticoagulation. [585] ACS patients with documented AF of any

ESC Guidelines **3777**


length have worse short- and long-term prognoses when compared
with patients in sinus rhythm. [584][,][586] There is some evidence to suggest
that transient, self-terminating AF during STEMI may be a predictor of
an increased risk of stroke during long-term follow-up. [584][,][587]

*12.2.5.2. Ventricular arrhythmias*
With the widespread increased uptake of emergency reperfusion ther-­
apies for patients with STEMI, the incidence of malignant arrhythmias
(ventricular tachycardia [VT] and ventricular fibrillation [VF]) has signifi-­
cantly declined. Nevertheless, 6–8% of patients with STEMI develop
haemodynamically significant VT or VF. [588] The typical arrhythmia presen-­
tation is unstable, frequently polymorphic, and relatively fast VT, often
degenerating into VF. Urgent reperfusion is most important as ischaemia
is often the trigger for these arrhythmias. Early administration of i.v. or
oral beta-blockers reduces the incidence of malignant arrhyth-­
mias. [163][,][164][,][169][,][589] Beta-blockers or amiodarone are recommended if ma-­
lignant arrhythmias occur and lidocaine may be considered if these are
contraindicated. [163][,][164][,][169][,][589][,][590] The prognostic role of early VT/VF
within the first 48 h of STEMI is still controversial. Several studies have
suggested that patients with early VT/VF have increased 30-day mortality
but no increase in long-term arrhythmic risk. [591][–][593] Another study has
suggested that while malignant ventricular arrhythmias occurring at the
time of reperfusion do not confer poor prognosis, sustained VT or VF
occurring during ongoing ischaemia or late after reperfusion (>48 h) is
associated with an increase in long-term mortality. [594] Sustained VT/VF
late after reperfusion (>48 h) requires an evaluation for ICD implant-­
ation for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Ventricular pre-­
mature beats are very frequent during the first 24 h after reperfusion for
STEMI and no specific therapy is required.

Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death with ICD implantation
within 40 days after MI is generally not indicated. Patients should be reevaluated for ICD implantation post-revascularization after a period of
6–12 weeks on evidence-based treatments, although patients with a
pre-existing impaired LVEF may be considered for ICD implantation
for primary prevention even within the early post-infarction period.
Some patients may develop electrical storm and/or incessant VT des-­
pite complete revascularization and treatment with anti-arrhythmic
drugs. Overdrive stimulation may help to control this situation; how-­
ever, recurrence of VT/VF upon cessation of stimulation is frequent
and catheter ablation of such triggers appears to be the preferred treat-­
ment option in centres with that expertise. Successful radiofrequency
ablation has been shown to abolish recurrent VT/VF. [595]

Non-sustained monomorphic VT is the most common form of ven-­
tricular arrhythmia in the early phase of ACS, and usually does not re-­
quire anti-arrhythmic treatment. Accelerated idioventricular rhythm at
reperfusion is frequent and does not require intervention given its be-­
nign nature. [596]

**12.2.6. Bleeding**
Bleeding is associated with a poor prognosis in ACS patients. [231][,][597][,][598]

The mechanisms by which bleeding increases the risk of death are com-­
plex and multifactorial. [599] While intracranial or massive haemorrhage
directly threatens life through fatal brain damage or sudden cardiocir-­
culatory collapse, other less severe forms of haemorrhage may increase
the risk of death through indirect mechanisms. Blood transfusion may
increase systemic inflammation and represents one of the possible links
between bleeding and subsequent mortality. [600] Bleeding is also a major
driver of unplanned DAPT discontinuation and the interruption of
other medication (e.g. statins, beta-blockers). [601][,][602]

**12.3. Comorbid conditions**

**12.3.1. Patients at high bleeding risk and with blood**
**disorders (anaemia and thrombocytopaenia)**

Anaemia is more prevalent in elderly/frail ACS patients and in patients
with multimorbidity (i.e. HF, chronic kidney disease [CKD], diabetes
mellitus, cancer, and autoimmune diseases). In some cases, severe an-­
aemia may precipitate Type 2 MI. Persistent or worsening anaemia in
patients with ACS is associated with an increased risk of recurrent is-­
chaemic events, death, and major bleeding. [623][–][625] According to the
ARC-HBR, haemoglobin <11 g/dL at the time of PCI constitutes a ma-­
jor criterion for HBR, whereas haemoglobin between 11 and 13 g/dL
(12 g/dL for women) is a minor criterion.

There is no established strategy for treating anaemia in patients with
ACS. The efficacy and safety of blood transfusion in this clinical scenario
remains unknown. In the majority of studies investigating different
transfusion protocols, a liberal blood transfusion strategy has been de-­
fined as any red blood cell transfusion at a haemoglobin level <9–10 g/
dL, while a restrictive blood transfusion strategy has been defined as any
transfusion at a haemoglobin level <7–8 g/dL. Observational data sug-­
gest that a liberal blood transfusion strategy may be associated with an
increase in all-cause mortality. [626][–][630] The open-label Restrictive and
Liberal Transfusion Strategies in Patients With Acute Myocardial
Infarction (REALITY) trial enrolled 668 ACS patients who were rando-­
mized to management with a restrictive (triggered by haemoglobin ≤8)
or a liberal (triggered by haemoglobin ≤10) transfusion strategy. [631] The
composite outcome (all-cause death, stroke, recurrent MI, or emer-­
gency revascularization) at 30 days occurred in a comparable number
of patients in both arms (11% vs. 14%, RR 0.79, with a one-sided
97.5% CI of 0.00–1.19), meeting the pre-specified non-inferiority criter-­
ion. All components of the composite endpoint were numerically high-­
er in the liberal transfusion strategy arm. The trial was not powered to
detect superiority of the restrictive strategy, and the CI included what
may be a clinically important harm. The pre-specified 1-year follow-up
of the REALITY trial yielded contradictory conclusions to the 30-day
outcomes: at 1 year, the restrictive transfusion strategy (vs. a liberal

ESC Guidelines **3779**


approach) did not achieve non-inferiority in terms of MACE. In add-­
ition, a *post-hoc* analysis of MACE between day 30 and 1 year demon-­
strated an increased risk in the restrictive transfusion strategy group. [632]

Therefore, no formal recommendation as to the optimal transfusion
strategy (liberal vs. restrictive) in patients with ACS can be made at

present.

Although there are several classifications to grade the severity
of thrombocytopaenia, clinically relevant thrombocytopaenia can
be defined as a platelet count <100 000/μL or a relative drop in platelet
count of 50% from baseline in the context of ACS. Thrombocytopaenia
increases the risk of death, major bleeding events, and life-threatening
thrombotic events. [633][,][634] The ARC-HBR criteria define a platelet count
<100 000/μL as a major criterion for HBR. Management of GP IIb/IIIa
inhibitor- and heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia is discussed in the
[Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

**12.3.2. Chronic kidney disease**

Moderate to severe CKD (stages III–V) is present in more than 30% of
ACS patients. [635] Patients with ACS and concomitant CKD receive less
interventional and pharmacological treatment and have a worse prog-­
nosis than patients with normal kidney function. [636][–][638] Likely contrib-­
uting factors to this worse prognosis include a larger number of
comorbidities and an increased risk of in-hospital complications, includ-­
ing serious bleeding complications. [639] Although evidence from RCTs is
lacking, data from observational and registry-based studies indicate
that ACS patients with moderate to severe CKD have a better
prognosis with early revascularization than with medical therapy
alone. [640][,][641]

[The type and dose of antithrombotic agent (see Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
online, *[Table S15](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* ) and the amount of contrast agent should be consid-­
ered based on kidney function. [635][,][642] In relation to supplementary i.v.
hydration during and after revascularization, the evidence around
choice, timing, and duration of treatment is somewhat conflicting. [643]

Taking the clinical circumstances and patient characteristics into consid-­
eration, i.v. hydration should be considered as part of the management
of ACS patients with a low eGFR undergoing invasive management to
minimize the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. [250][,][635][,][642][,][644][,][645] For
recommendations on long-term treatment in patients with ACS and
concomitant CKD, please refer to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardio-­
vascular disease prevention. [646]

**12.3.3. Diabetes mellitus**

ACS patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) may more commonly pre-­
sent with non-specific symptoms, which can lead to delays in both diag-­
nosis and access to treatment. [647][,][648] Both treatment in the acute phase
and risk factor management post-ACS is poorer in patients with DM
and these patients tend to have more advanced CAD at diagnosis.
These factors likely contribute to the worse long-term prognosis asso-­
ciated with ACS in patients with DM, particularly in patients requiring
insulin treatment. [649][–][651]

All patients with ACS, regardless of a history of DM, should have
their glycaemic status evaluated during hospitalization. Given that
the ACS itself may give rise to hyperglycaemia due to catechol-­
amine-induced stress, a diagnosis of DM made during hospitalization
should be subsequently confirmed. While several studies have shown
the benefits of managing hyperglycaemia (>11.0 mmol/L or 200 mg/
dL) in hospitalized ACS patients, the risk of hypoglycaemia-related
events when using intensive insulin therapy should not be ne-­
glected. [652][–][654]


Glucose lowering is important in order to prevent microvascular
complications in patients with DM. However, recent trial evidence
has shown that the reduction in the risk of new ACS events, HF,
and renal impairment with glucose-lowering medications like so-­
dium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like
peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RA) is independent of baseline
glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. [655][–][657] This should be taken
into consideration when choosing glucose-lowering therapy for pa-­
tients with DM and concomitant CAD. For further details, please re-­
fer to the 2023 ESC Guidelines on diabetes and cardiovascular

diseases and the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular disease
prevention. [646][,][658]

**12.3.4. Older adults with frailty and multimorbidity**
*12.3.4.1. The older person*

Older adults represent an increasing proportion of ACS patients. One
of the major predictors of adverse outcomes following ACS is age, but
patients aged ≥75 years are often excluded from or under-represented
in clinical trials. [659][,][660] Older age is associated with frailty, multimorbid-­
ity, and a greater risk of both ischaemic and bleeding events in patients
with ACS. [661] Hs-cTn assays have an excellent diagnostic performance
in the older person, but the specificity of the test is lower than in young-­
er patients, and elevated cTn levels are more commonly associated with
conditions other than ACS in older patients. [662]

There are limited data on the optimal management of older adults
with ACS. [663] A small RCT enrolling older patients (≥80 years) with
NSTE-ACS reported the superiority of an invasive vs. a conservative
strategy in the reduction of the composite of MI, need for urgent revas-­
cularization, stroke, and death. No treatment effect was shown for allcause death and the benefit associated with the invasive strategy was
diluted with increasing age. [664] In the absence of robust clinical trial
evidence, decisions regarding how to manage older patients should
be individualized based on patient characteristics (i.e. ischaemic and
bleeding risks, estimated life expectancy, comorbidities, the need for
non-cardiac surgery, quality of life, frailty, cognitive and functional im-­
pairment, patient values and preferences, and the estimated risks and
benefits of an invasive strategy).

In the context of STEMI, PPCI has drastically improved outcomes for
all ages. However, data are limited in the ‘very old’ cohort, with lack of
formal assessment of frailty or comorbidity. [665] In the context of CS and
cardiac arrest, age is an independent predictor of mortality following
PCI. [666][,][667] In the absence of robust RCT data, PPCI should be consid-­
ered for all patients with STEMI. When PPCI cannot be performed in a
timely manner, fibrinolysis may be a reasonable strategy in these pa-­
tients. For details regarding pharmacotherapy in older patients, please
[see the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

*12.3.4.2. Frailty and multimorbidity*

Geriatric syndromes (i.e. frailty and multimorbidity) are associated with
adverse outcomes in older patients with ACS. [668][,][669] Frailty is a syn-­
drome characterized by reduced biological reserve, leading to a failure
of homeostatic mechanisms following stressor events, including ACS.
There is a lack of consensus on which frailty assessment tool is optimal
in older patients with CV disease. [670][,][671]

Frail patients with NSTE-ACS less frequently receive ACS pharma-­
cotherapies and invasive assessment, have more complex coronary dis-­
ease, have longer durations of hospital stay, and are at higher risk of
death. [672] Specifically, frail patients are reported to have a higher rate
of a composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, unplanned

**3780** ESC Guidelines


revascularization, and major bleeding. [673] Frail older adults with
NSTE-ACS have poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at baseline.
Invasive management appears to be associated with modest improve-­
ments in HRQoL through to 1 year follow-up in these patients. This im-­
provement in HRQoL is most marked in frail and pre-frail patients, who
receive a proportionally larger benefit than robust patients. [674] In older
adults with NSTE-ACS referred for coronary angiography, the pres-­
ence of multimorbidity is associated with an increased risk of long-term
adverse CV events, driven by a higher risk of all-cause mortality. [675]

Undiagnosed cognitive impairment is also common in older patients
with NSTE-ACS undergoing ICA, and these patients are more likely
to experience MACE at 1 year. [676]

In the absence of robust RCT data to inform healthcare professionals
about the management of frail patients presenting with ACS, it is re-­
commended to adapt a holistic approach to individualize interventional
and pharmacological treatments after careful evaluation of risks vs. ben-­
efits. To aid in decision-making, the routine assessment of frailty (e.g.
Rockwood Frailty Score) and comorbidity (e.g. Charlson index) in
ACS patients is recommended. Following risk stratification using frailty
assessment and evaluation of the comorbidity burden, it may be rea-­
sonable to offer optimal medical therapy plus an invasive strategy to frail
patients at high risk of future CV events and low risk of complications,
and to offer optimal medical therapy alone to those who are deemed to
be at low risk of future events with a high risk of developing procedural
complications. For those patients for whom any form of treatment
might be futile, then a palliative end-of-life care approach should be

considered.

**12.3.5. Pregnancy**
Acute coronary syndrome diagnostic criteria are the same for preg-­
nant and non-pregnant patients. [677] Pregnant women with STEMI
should not be managed differently to non-pregnant women. Given
the high mortality associated with STEMI in pregnancy, PPCI is the
preferred reperfusion therapy. [678] The management plan for pregnant
women with ACS should be determined by a multidisciplinary team
consisting of cardiologists, obstetricians, anaesthesiologists, and neo-­
natologists, and these patients should be treated in an intensive care
unit that can provide maternal monitoring and obstetric care. [678][,][679]

ACS treatment should not be delayed for delivery. Delivery should
be ideally postponed for at least 2 weeks post-ACS as there is in-­
creased risk of maternal mortality during this time. [678] It has been de-­
monstrated that SCAD is the most common cause of AMI in

pregnancy, and this tends to occur mainly in the late pregnancy or
early post-partum periods. [680][,][681] Further details are provided in the
[Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

[Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

**12.3.7. Patients with cancer**

The four most common types of cancer in patients with ACS are pros-­
tate, breast, colon, and lung. [682] Patients with a history of cancer should
be treated like all other ACS patients, but the management of ACS pa-­
tients with active cancer has some specific issues that need to be taken
into consideration. Outcomes vary across types of cancer and the


balance between the ischaemic and bleeding risks should be considered

on an individual basis.

The percentage of ACS patients with a current diagnosis of cancer is
rising, and currently constitutes ∼3% of patients in large observational
studies. [683] Patients with active cancer presenting with ACS pose im-­
portant challenges as there are significant gaps in scientific knowledge.
Therefore, recommendations based on solid evidence are scarce.
Patients with active cancer presenting with ACS tend to be older,
with a larger number of comorbidities and more extensive CAD.
These patients often have concomitant haematologic and coagulation
abnormalities that may present a challenge with respect to both the
use of antithrombotic therapy and the performing of PCI. [684]

Observational studies have reported that ACS in patients with cancer
is associated with increased risk of major CV events, bleeding, and car-­
diac and non-cardiac mortality. [682][,][683][,][685][,][686] As per the ARC-HBR cri-­
teria, patients with active cancer diagnosed in the past 12 months are

considered as HBR.

The diagnosis of ACS in patients with cancer should be based on the
same principles as in patients without cancer. The management of ACS
in patients with cancer can be challenging because of frailty, increased
bleeding risk, thrombocytopaenia, and increased thrombotic risk. [687]

Temporary interruption of cancer treatment and an urgent multidiscip-­
linary approach is recommended. [688] Cancer patients with ACS have
been reported to less frequently undergo invasive management; how-­
ever, invasive management (and PCI with DES if needed) is recom-­
mended in ACS patients with cancer, as long as the prognosis is >6
months or, irrespective of the prognosis, if the patient is unstable. [689]

Retrospective data have reported both a lower use of invasive manage-­
ment in cancer patients with STEMI, and better outcomes in patients
who do undergo invasive management. [682][,][686][,][689] Invasive management
in patients with advanced cancer or life expectancy <6 months has
been reported to not demonstrate a mortality benefit compared
with a conservative approach and therefore a conservative strategy
should be considered in these patients. [690] When the coronary anatomy
is not amenable for PCI, CABG surgery can be considered after a multi-­
disciplinary team discussion and where the cancer prognosis is >12
months. Given that they are considered to be HBR, the preferred
P2Y 12 inhibitor for ACS patients with active cancer is clopidogrel. [687]

Potential drug–drug interactions with cancer therapies should be
checked when using ticagrelor or clopidogrel, since some
pharmacokinetic-based drug–drug interactions via CYP450 may occur.

When acute ischaemia is provoked by cancer therapy, alternative
cancer therapies should be considered after a multidisciplinary team
discussion. Some specific cancer treatments can have cardiotoxic vas-­
[cular effects that can lead to ACS (Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
*[Table S16](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* ). Following ACS, a review of the cancer medications is re-­
commended, and any cancer drug associated with thrombosis and MI
should be stopped. Cancer therapies that are not associated with MI
can be restarted once revascularization (when indicated) has been com-­
pleted and the patient is stabilized on ACS medical therapy without
complications. Additional information can be found in the
[Supplementary data online, including](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

ESC Guidelines **3783**


**13.1. Cardiac rehabilitation**

**13.1.1. Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation**
Secondary prevention is most effectively provided through cardiac re-­
habilitation (CR). [716][,][717] All ACS patients should participate in a com-­
prehensive CR programme, which should start as early as possible
after the ACS event. [716][,][717][,][719] CR may be performed in inpatient or
outpatient settings, taking age, frailty, results of prognostic risk stratifi-­
cation, and comorbidities into account. [716] Comprehensive CR is a
multidisciplinary intervention, supervised and performed by a team
and usually co-ordinated by a cardiologist. [716] The core components
of CR include patient assessment, management and control of CV
risk factors, physical activity counselling, prescription of exercise train-­
ing, dietary advice, tobacco counselling, patient education, psychosocial
management, and vocational support. [716] Several studies have found
that CR programmes after atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD) events or revascularization reduce CV hospitalizations, MI,
CV mortality and, in some studies, all-cause mortality. [720][–][725] Despite
proven benefits, the rates of referral to, participation in, and implemen-­
tation of CR programmes are low. [726][–][730] Another identified issue is
that many patients adopt healthier lifestyles during CR but relapse to
pre-morbid habits when returning to everyday life. [731] Therefore, there
is an unmet need for complementary pathways to the classical centrebased CR model. In addition to alternatives to CR, there is also a need
for stronger endorsement of CR by physicians, cardiologists, and
healthcare professionals. [732][,][733] It is also important to initiate and estab-­
lish a strong partnership between patients and healthcare professionals
as early as possible. [732][–][734]

**13.1.2. Digital health**
Telerehabilitation may be an effective strategy to maintain a healthy life-­
style over time and can support or even partially replace conventional,
centre-based CR. [729] Telerehabilitation means rehabilitation from a dis-­
tance, covering all CR core components, including telecoaching, social
interaction, telemonitoring, and e-learning. [735][,][736] Studies in patients
with CAD have shown that telerehabilitation can be equivalent to trad-­
itional CR in terms of achieving functional improvement, managing risk
factors, and increasing patient well-being. [737][–][741] Few data are available
about the effect of telerehabilitation on recurrent events. [742]

Nevertheless, in a meta-analysis no significant difference was found be-­
tween mortality following telehealth interventions and centre-based
supervised CR. [743] Also, most trials have only focused on one of the
CR core components—exercise training and/or physical activity. [742]

Therefore, more research on the impact of telerehabilitation on out-­
comes is still needed, as are investigations into health and digital literacy

in CR.

**13.1.3. Adherence and persistence**

Promotion of both adherence (the extent to which a patient adheres to
a prescribed treatment or lifestyle advice) and persistence (the length of
time between initiation and discontinuation of a prescribed treatment
or lifestyle advice) are key in preventing recurrent CV events after ACS.
Adherence to medication has been shown to be sub-optimal, ranging
from 50% in primary prevention to 66% in secondary prevention. It
is estimated that 9% of ASCVD events in Europe occur as a result of
sub-optimal medication adherence. [646] Contributors to sub-optimal ad-­
herence and persistence are multidimensional and include: polyphar-­
macy, drug regimen complexity, the doctor–patient relationship, a
lack of patient-centred care and disease acceptance, concern regarding
side effects, cognitive ability, mental and physical disorders, financial


aspects, living alone, and depression. [646][,][744][–][749] Polypills, which include
guideline-recommended treatments for secondary prevention, have
been shown to increase adherence in post-ACS patients and may im-­
prove therapeutic targets. [750][–][752] The Secondary Prevention of
Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly (SECURE) study is the only
RCT testing the impact of a strategy based on a polypill (containing as-­
pirin, ramipril, and atorvastatin) vs. usual care on hard outcomes in ACS
patients. The polypill strategy was associated with a significant reduc-­
tion in major CV events, driven by a significant 33% reduction in CV
mortality. [753] The use of technology to improve medication adherence
is also generating interest: mobile phone applications and mobile health
(mHealth) tools may improve medication adherence, but clinical trials
of sufficient size and duration are needed. [754][–][756] Finally, it is important
to recognize that adherence has complex underlying psychological dri-­
vers, and therefore a whole-systems approach is mandatory. This
should include the education of health professionals, the use of patientreported outcomes and experience measures, patient education, and
patient-centred care. [734][,][757][,][758]

**13.2. Lifestyle management**
Lifestyle management is one of the cornerstones of comprehensive
CR. [716] While most of the evidence regarding the benefits of a
healthy lifestyle on prognosis comes from primary prevention,
studies in secondary prevention settings indicate similar beneficial
effects. [716][,][724][,][759][–][763]

**13.2.1. Tobacco**

Tobacco abstinence is associated with a reduced risk of re-infarction
(30–40%) and death (35–45%) after ACS. [763][–][765] Measures to promote
cessation of smoking are therefore a priority after ACS. Interventions
for smoking cessation should begin during hospitalization using a com-­
bination of behavioural interventions, pharmacotherapy, and counsel-­
ling. [18][,][766] Many patients continue or resume smoking after ACS, in
particular patients with depression and environmental exposures. [646]

During encounters with smokers, the ‘very brief advice’ evidence-based
intervention should be used to facilitate dialogue between the patient
and healthcare worker. [646] Drug interventions, including nicotinereplacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and varenicline, should be con-­
sidered along with behavioural support. All forms of NRT are effective,
and the anti-depressant bupropion aids in long-term smoking cessation
with similar efficacy to NRT. [646][,][766] Varenicline is the most effective
medical treatment to support smoking cessation and is safe to use in
ACS patients. [767][–][770] An average weight gain of 5 kg can be expected
when a person quits smoking, but it is important to recognize that
the CV risk from continued smoking outweighs the CV risk from gain-­
ing weight. [646]

E-cigarettes have been used to help smokers quit, but evidence on
their impact on successful smoking cessation is insufficient, particularly
with regard to whether using e-cigarettes actually helps the person re-­
main tobacco free. While e-cigarettes do contain nicotine, they do not
contain as many tobacco chemicals as cigarettes. Caution should be gi-­
ven with respect to the use of e-cigarettes, as current evidence suggests
they are harmful to CV health by increasing arterial stiffness, heart rate
and blood pressure, and by causing endothelial dysfunction. [771]

**13.2.2. Nutrition and alcohol**

A healthy diet and eating habits influence CV risk. Adopting a
Mediterranean-style diet can help reduce CV risk in all individuals, in-­
cluding persons at high CV risk and patients with ASCVD. [761][,][762][,][772]

**3784** ESC Guidelines


[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S17* summarizes the characteristics of
a healthy diet that should be adhered to. For further details on nutrition,
please refer to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular disease
prevention. [646]

With regard to alcohol consumption, recent data suggest that alco-­
hol abstainers have the lowest risk of CVD outcomes, that any amount
of alcohol uniformly increases blood pressure and body mass index, and
that a weekly consumption of >100 g of alcohol is associated with de-­
creased life expectancy. [773][–][775] Accordingly, it is recommended to re-­
strict alcohol consumption to a maximum of 100 g per week (same
limit for men and women). [646]

**13.2.3. Physical activity and exercise**
Based on extensive data from the general population, sedentary behav-­
iour, defined as time spent sitting or lying with low energy expenditure,
while awake, is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality. [776][,][777]

According to recommendations from the World Health Organization,
adults with chronic conditions should limit their amount of sedentary
time, replacing it with physical activity of any intensity (including light in-­
tensity). [646][,][778] General physical activity recommendations include a
combination of regular aerobic physical activity and resistance exercise
throughout the week, which also forms the basis of recommendations
for patients post-ACS. [646][,][778] However, it is important to recognize that
daily physical activity does not replace participation in exercise-based
CR. With support from multiple randomized trials, exercise training
is a pivotal part of comprehensive CR and participation in exercisebased CR should be offered to all patients after ACS. [779]

Cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong predictor of future prognosis
both in the general population and in post-ACS patients. [780]

**13.2.4. Psychological considerations**

There is a two-fold risk of anxiety and mood disorders in patients
with heart disease. Depression, anxiety, and psychological stress
are associated with worse outcomes. Psychological and pharmaco-­
logical interventions can have a beneficial effect and should be consid-­
ered for ACS patients with depression, anxiety, and stress. [781] It is
recommended that all patients have their mental well-being assessed
using validated tools before discharge, with consideration of onward
psychological referral when appropriate. [782] For further details,
please refer to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular disease
prevention. [646]

**13.2.5. Resumption of activities**

Information on the resumption of activities, sexual activity, and
[environmental factors is presented in the Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

*[Section 13.1.2](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* .

**13.3. Pharmacological treatment**
**13.3.1. Antithrombotic therapy**

Recommendations for antithrombotic therapy are included in *Section 6* .

**13.3.2. Lipid-lowering therapy**
Dyslipidaemia should be managed according to the current dyslipidae-­
mia guidelines, with a combination of lifestyle and pharmacological


interventions. [783] Trials have consistently demonstrated that lower lowdensity lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels after ACS are associated
with lower CV event rates. [784] The current treatment goal for second-­
ary prevention is to lower LDL-C to <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL) and to
achieve a ≥50% LDL-C reduction from baseline. For patients who ex-­
perience a second CV event within 2 years (not necessarily of the same
type as the first event), an LDL-C goal of <1.0 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL) ap-­
pears to confer additional benefit. [783][,][785][,][786]

After an ACS event, lipid-lowering treatment should be initiated as
early as possible, both for prognostic benefit and to increase patient
adherence after discharge. It is recommended that a high-intensity sta-­
tin (e.g. atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) is initiated as early as possible
after hospital admission, preferably before planned PCI, and pre-­
scribed up to the highest tolerated dose in order to reach the LDL-C
goals. [783][,][787] The intensity of statin therapy should be increased in pa-­
tients who were receiving low- or moderate-intensity statin treatment
before the ACS event. In IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of
Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), ezetimibe treatment
early after ACS (within 10 days) was added on top of prior statin ther-­
apy or initiated concomitantly in statin-naïve patients (two-thirds of
patients) and compared with statin monotherapy. [788] Treatment with
ezetimibe was shown to be safe and provided long-term benefits for
CV outcomes. As such, if patients are on a maximally tolerated statin
dose, or have no prior statin treatment, and have LDL-C levels which
indicate it is unlikely that targets will be reached with statin therapy
alone, initiating ezetimibe in addition to a statin (or statin plus ezeti-­
mibe combination treatment) may be considered during the ACS
hospitalization. [783][,][788] In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (Evaluation of
Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During
Treatment With Alirocumab) trial, treatment with the proprotein con-­
vertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor alirocumab was in-­
itiated as early as 1 month after ACS. [786] Treatment with PCSK9
inhibitors has been shown to be safe and effective in lowering LDL-C
in patients hospitalized with ACS. [789][–][791] Recent data have also shown
improvements in plaque phenotype and plaque regression in ACS pa-­
tients treated with PCSK9 inhibitors. [792][,][793] Combined with the data

from trials on the long-term benefits of PCSK9 inhibitors and observa-­
tional data on the importance of lowering LDL-C early after ACS,
PCSK9 inhibitor treatment should be initiated during ACS hospitaliza-­
tion in patients who were not at their LDL-C goal despite being on
statin and ezetimibe treatment before admission. [785][,][786][,][794][–][796]

In all cases, lipid levels should be re-evaluated 4–6 weeks after each
treatment or dose adjustment to determine whether treatment goals
have been achieved and to check for any safety issues; the therapeutic
regimen can then be adapted accordingly. If the LDL-C goals are not

achieved with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin alone after 4–
6 weeks following ACS, adding ezetimibe is recommended. [783][,][788]

Initiation of PCSK9 inhibitor treatment is recommended in patients
who do not reach their LDL-C goal despite maximum tolerated statin
and ezetimibe therapy. [783][,][785][,][786] Finally, icosapent ethyl, at a dose of 2 g
b.i.d., can be used in combination with a statin in patients with ACS and
triglyceride levels of 1.5–5.6 mmol/L (135–499 mg/dL) despite statin
treatment. [783][,][797] An algorithm for lipid-lowering management in ACS
patients is outlined in *Figure 18* .

**13.3.3. Beta-blockers**

The clinical benefit of beta-blockers after ACS in patients with reduced
LVEF is supported by evidence from contemporary trials. [557][,][798][–][800]

However, the evidence for prescribing beta-blockers after uncompli-­
cated ACS in patients with LVEF >40% is less well established. With


the exception of the CAPRICORN (CArvedilol Post-infaRct survIval
COntRolled evaluatioN) trial, which only recruited patients with
LVEF ≤40%, all large RCTs testing the benefits of post-MI beta-blocker
maintenance were performed in the pre-reperfusion era. [801] Pooled
data demonstrated that post-MI beta-blocker therapy reduced the

**3786** ESC Guidelines


risk of death by >20%. These trials mostly enrolled patients with STEMI,
making the evidence for their benefit in NSTEMI less robust. In addition,
since these trials were performed, the clinical scenario has changed dra-­
matically, with improvements in invasive strategies and associated
pharmacotherapy resulting in an improved prognosis for patients
with ACS. [718] Modern observational studies and meta-analyses of these
trials have yielded mixed results, with some studies suggesting a benefit
of beta-blocker therapy irrespective of LVEF, and others reaching the
opposite conclusion. [557][,][800][,][802][–][804]

There is only one small, open-label trial, CAPITAL-RCT (Carvedilol
Post-Intervention Long-Term Administration in Large-scale
Randomized Controlled Trial), that randomized 801 STEMI patients
with successful PPCI and preserved LVEF to carvedilol or control. [805]

During a 3-year follow-up, the incidence of a composite of all-cause death,
MI, hospitalization for HF, and hospitalization for ACS was not significantly
different between the two groups. However, the trial was underpowered
and therefore this scientific question remains open. There are four on-­
going pragmatic prospective large-scale RCTs in Europe randomizing
ACS patients without reduced LVEF to beta-blocker or control:
REBOOT-CNIC (TREatment With Beta-blockers After myOcardial
Infarction withOut Reduced Ejection fracTion), 8468 ACS patients with
LVEF >40%; REDUCE-SWEDEHEART (Evaluation of Decreased Usage
of Betablockers After Myocardial Infarction in the SWEDEHEART
Registry), 5000 ACS patients with LVEF ≥50% (NCT03278509);
BETAMI (BEtablocker Treatment After Acute Myocardial Infarction in
Patients Without Reduced Left Ventricular Systolic Function), 10 000
ACS patients with LVEF >40%; and DANBLOCK (Danish Trial of Beta
Blocker Treatment After Myocardial Infarction Without Reduced
Ejection Fraction), 3570 ACS patients with LVEF >40%. [806][–][808]

The duration of beta-blocker therapy after uncomplicated ACS is
also another controversial topic. There are some observational studies
suggesting that the clinical benefit of beta-blocker therapy is restricted
to the first year after the index ACS event, but the non-randomized na-­
ture of the studies limits their conclusions. [809] There are two ongoing
large-scale RCTs testing the impact of beta-blocker withdrawal after
6–12 months following uncomplicated ACS in patients with preserved
LVEF: AβYSS (Beta Blocker Interruption After Uncomplicated
Myocardial Infarction; NCT03498066) and SMART-DECISION
(Long-term Beta-blocker Therapy After Acute Myocardial Infarction;
NCT04769362). [810]

**13.3.4. Nitrates and calcium channel blockers**

Intravenous nitrates may be useful during the acute phase in STEMI pa-­
tients with hypertension or HF, provided there is no hypotension or RV
infarction. In the ISIS-4 (Fourth International Study of Infarct Survival)
trial, oral nitrates had no survival benefit in MI patients. [811] Their use
is therefore restricted to the control of residual angina, as recom-­
mended in the 2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management
of chronic coronary syndromes. [195] Calcium channel blocker use was
not associated with prognostic benefit in a systematic review including
28 trials. [812] Calcium channel blocker use can be considered in the con-­
text of residual angina and for blood pressure control as recommended
in the 2021 ESC Guidelines on CVD prevention and the 2019 ESC
Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of CCS. [195][,][646]

**13.3.5. Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system**
**inhibitors**

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been demon-­
strated to improve outcomes in post-MI patients with additional


conditions, such as clinical HF and/or LVEF ≤40%, diabetes, CKD,
and/or hypertension. [813][–][817] A systematic overview of (old) trials of
ACE inhibition early in STEMI showed that their use is associated
with a small but significant reduction in 30-day mortality, especially in
anterior MIs. [818]

In the VALsartan In Acute myocardial iNfarcTion (VALIANT) trial,
valsartan was found to be non-inferior to captopril in patients with a
recent MI plus HF and/or LVEF ≤40%. [819]

There is established evidence that patients with heart failure with re-­
duced ejection fraction (HFrEF), regardless of aetiology, benefit from
ACE inhibitors. [820][–][823] Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors
(ARNI) have been shown to be superior to ACE inhibitors in patients
with established HF (of different aetiologies) and LVEF ≤40%. [824]

However, in the more recent PARADISE-MI (Prospective ARNI vs
ACE Inhibitor Trial to Determine Superiority in Reducing Heart
Failure Events After MI), a dedicated study in patients with recent
ACS (1–7 days) complicated by HF and/or LVEF ≤40%, an ARNI com-­
bination (sacubitril plus valsartan) was not associated with a significantly
lower incidence of death from CV causes or incident HF in comparison
to the active comparator ramipril. [825]

In general, ACE inhibitors (or sacubitril plus valsartan as a replace-­
ment for them) are recommended for patients with established
HFrEF regardless of the aetiology. [557] These agents may be considered
for patients with HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction. [557] Patients

who tolerate neither ACE inhibitors nor ARNI are recommended to

be treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker.

In the Eplerenone Post-AMI Heart failure Efficacy and SUrvival Study
(EPHESUS), the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) eplere-­
none was associated with reduced mortality and CV hospitalizations
in patients with a recent MI and LV dysfunction with symptoms of ei-­
ther HF or diabetes. [826] The Double-Blind, Randomized,
Placebo-Controlled Trial Evaluating The Safety And Efficacy Of Early
Treatment With Eplerenone In Patients With Acute Myocardial
Infarction (REMINDER) trial randomized 1012 patients with acute
STEMI without HF to eplerenone or placebo within 24 h of symptom
onset. [827] The primary endpoint was the composite of CV mortality, rehospitalization, or extended initial hospital stay due to diagnosis of HF,
sustained VT or VF, ejection fraction ≤40%, or elevated BNP/NT-pro
BNP at 1 month or more after randomization. Eplerenone was asso-­
ciated with a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint,
although this difference was primarily driven by BNP levels. [827]

**13.3.6. Medications for diabetes**

*13.3.6.1. Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors*

Pharmacological blockade of SGLT2 induces glycosuria with lowering of
plasma glucose levels, improving glycaemic control without hypogly-­
caemia, and leading to reductions in weight and blood pressure. [828] In
patients with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD, three trials
(with empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) have demonstrated
significant CV benefits. [656][,][829][,][830] In a meta-analysis of these three trials,
MACE were reduced by 11%, with no clear effect on stroke or MI. This
benefit was only seen in patients with established ASCVD. [698] The ben-­
efits of SGLT2 inhibitors may relate more to cardio-renal haemo-­
dynamic effects than to atherosclerosis. [646] Further recommendations
for patients with diabetes can be found in the current ESC Guidelines
on diabetes, pre-diabetes,and cardiovascular diseases. [831]

In patients with HF regardless of their LVEF, dapagliflozin and empa-­
gliflozin have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of worsening
HF or CV death, both in the presence or absence of type 2

ESC Guidelines **3787**


diabetes. [702][,][703][,][832][,][833] In the EMMY (EMpagliflozin in patients with acute
MYocardial infarction) trial, empagliflozin led to a significant improve-­
ment in NT-pro BNP reduction over 26 weeks post-MI, accompanied
by a significant improvement in echocardiographic functional and
structural parameters. [834] Ongoing outcome trials in ACS populations
will be useful to better define the role of these agents in the absence
of HF. [835]

*13.3.6.2. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists*

In a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven trials (56 004 patients
with type 2 diabetes) testing different GLP1-RAs, their use was asso-­
ciated with reductions in the incidence of MACE, CV death, all-cause
mortality, MI, and stroke. [699]

**13.3.7. Proton pump inhibitors**

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce the risk of upper gastroduodenal
bleeding in patients treated with antiplatelet agents. [287][,][836][,][837] Therapy
with a PPI is indicated for patients receiving any antithrombotic regimen
who are at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (for details see *[Section](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)*
*[8.2.2.3](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* [, Bleeding risk assessment, in the Supplementary data online).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

PPIs that inhibit CYP2C19, particularly omeprazole and esomepra-­
zole, may reduce the pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel,
though there is no strong evidence that this results in an increased
risk of ischaemic events or stent thrombosis in clinical trials and propen-­
sity score-matched studies. [287][,][288][,][838][–][842] Importantly, no interaction
between the concomitant use of PPIs and aspirin, prasugrel or ticagre-­
lor has been observed.

**13.3.8. Vaccination**

An annual influenza vaccination in patients with stable ASCVD appears
to be associated with reduced incidence of MI, an improved prognosis
in patients with HF, and decreased CV risk in adults aged 65 years and
older. [843][,][844] In addition, influenza vaccination given early after an MI or
in high-risk CAD has been shown to result in a lower risk of all-cause
death and CV death at 12 months. [845][–][847] Therefore, influenza vaccin-­
ation is recommended for all ACS patients and should be given prefer-­
entially during index hospitalization during influenza season for those
not protected by a seasonal influenza vaccination.

**13.3.9. Anti-inflammatory drugs**
Inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
and acute coronary events. Several recent trials have tested the role of
the anti-inflammatory agent colchicine in acute and chronic coronary
syndromes. [848][,][849] In the Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial
(COLCOT), which enrolled 4745 patients with a recent ACS event,
low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) was associated with a significant re-­
duction of the primary composite endpoint (CV death, resuscitated
cardiac arrest, MI, stroke, or urgent revascularization) in comparison
to placebo. [850] Of note, pneumonia was more frequent in the colchicine
group. The Low-dose Colchicine trial-2 (LoDoCo2) enrolled 5522 pa-­
tients with CCS (84% of whom had prior ACS) who were randomized
to colchicine (0.5 mg daily) or placebo. [851] The primary endpoint (com-­
posite of CV death, MI, stroke, or ischaemia-driven coronary revascu-­
larization) rate was significantly lower in the colchicine group; however,
the incidence of non-CV death was higher in the colchicine group. The
benefits of colchicine in reducing CV events have been shown to be
consistent irrespective of history and timing of prior ACS. [852]

###### **14. Patient perspectives**

**14.1. Patient-centred care**

The management of patients with ACS should not only consider the
best available evidence with regard to clinical management strategies,
but also should be mindful of the provision of care that is respectful
of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values,
ensuring that these values are included in clinical decision-making. [881]

Patient-centred care should be guided by ethical values when consid-­
ering a patient’s physical, emotional, and psychological needs. Adopting
a person-centred care approach after an ACS event improves patient
outcomes and enhances quality of life. [882] Patients who are regarded
as equal partners in their ACS medical management are more likely
to actively engage and participate in their own healthcare. [883]

Educating and involving patients in their care should be seen as a con-­
tinuous process. Engaging and educating the patient is a key component
of ACS care and should take place throughout their patient journey,
from admission to hospital discharge and cardiac rehabilitation
( *Figure 19* ).

**14.2. Shared decision-making**
Shared decision-making is a process, during which the patient and a
healthcare professional work together to make an informed decision
about the patient’s care. [884] During this process, information is pro-­
vided, comprehension checked, and the patient is given an opportunity
to ask questions in order to equip them with the tools needed to make

an informed decision.

Using a shared decision-making approach during the consent process
allows the patient’s preferences to be established. [884] Discovery of the
patient’s concerns, goals, preferences, and values should be a central
component of this process. The use of validated decision aids and
audio-visual tools may also be helpful to facilitate informed consent
and promote patient involvement. [884][–][887]


**14.3. Informed consent**

Informed consent should include the components listed in
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S18* . [885][,][888] Informed consent is an op-­
portunity to educate patients about the proposed procedure, the asso-­
ciated risks and benefits, and any available alternative interventions or
treatments. [886][,][887] Assessment of the patient’s understanding of the in-­
formation given to them during the informed consent process using the
[‘teach back’ technique should be considered (Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
online, *[Figure S6](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* ). [885][,][889][–][891] The teach back method assesses under-­
standing by asking patients to state in their own words what they

need to know or do about their health.

Informed consent is an ethical and legal obligation for medical practi-­
tioners and is required before any invasive procedure. The information

**3790** ESC Guidelines


should be provided in a simple and clear format. In patients undergoing
emergency invasive angiography, a shortened informed consent pro-­
cess is appropriate. If a shortened informed consent process has
been used, it is important that there is contact with the patient and/
or family member after the intervention when the patient is physically
and psychologically stable or following the death of the patient. [892]

**14.4. Research participation and consent in**
**the acute setting**
With unstable ACS patients, it is often challenging to obtain their con-­
sent for emergency procedures—and even more challenging to enrol
in clinical trials due to a number of factors, including the necessity for
prompt clinical care, increased pain and stress levels, and impairment
of consciousness. Where clinical trials are conducted, patient involve-­
ment in enrolment decisions is paramount, if possible. [893][,][894] A short


witnessed verbal consent, followed by written consent after the acute
phase, has been shown to be less stressful and more positively re-­
ceived than written consent in the acute setting. [894] The research
and consent process must follow the ethical and legal requirements
in the relevant country. Further information can be found in the
[Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

**14.5. Patient satisfaction and expectations**
Focusing healthcare around the needs and preferences of patients has
the potential to improve clinical outcomes, quality of care and patient
satisfaction, while decreasing healthcare costs and health disparities. [881]

Patient perception of care is built on interpersonal interactions, the
quality of clinical communication, delivery of care, and the administra-­
tive management of care. ACS patient expectations are summarized
in *Figure 20* and further information can be found in the
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Table S19* .

**14.6. Patient-reported outcome measures**
**and patient-reported experience**

**measures**

Understanding and measuring patient expectations and health out-­
comes using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and pa-­
tient-reported experience measures (PREMs) is central to improving
patient satisfaction and delivering patient-centred care. [895] The quality
of care for ACS patients should be measured during the patient’s jour-­
ney from initial presentation until discharge. Further information can be
found in the [Supplementary data online. Further information on](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)
[PROMs and PREMs is also provided in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

**14.7. Preparation for discharge**
Many ACS patients may not be fully aware of what has happened to
them and how to best manage their healthcare after discharge, leading
to them both wanting and needing more information upon dis-­
charge. [896] Cognitive impairment can occur as a complication of ACS
and some patients may have difficulty with instructions for care when
transitioning towards discharge home. [897] Therefore, discharge infor-­
mation should be provided in both verbal and written formats and
should include a discharge letter outlining the key components of the
evidence-based discharge plan (Supplementary data online,
*[Table S20](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)* ). [898][–][901] Some important messages aimed at patients on
how to improve their heart health after ACS are demonstrated in
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Figure S5* . Moreover, following an ACS
event, anxiety and depression are frequently encountered and confer
an increased risk of non-adherence to medications and lifestyle changes,
subsequent MACE, and death. [902][–][904] Non-adherence also generally in-­
creases over time, which has additional impact on clinical outcomes. [905]

Assessing and identifying these patients and intervening with onward
psychological referral is recommended. [858] Further information can be
[found in the Supplementary data online. A summary of patient con-­](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data)

[vided in Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad191#supplementary-data) *Figure S7* .

**Epidemiology of ACS**
Acute coronary syndromes encompass a spectrum of conditions that
include patients with a recent change in clinical symptoms or signs,
with or without changes on 12-lead ECG and with or without acute ele-­
vations in cardiac troponin concentrations. ACS are commonly classi-­
fied based on ECG at presentation and the presence or absence of
troponin elevation into UA, NSTEMI, or STEMI. The incidence of
STEMI is decreasing whereas the incidence of NSTEMI is increasing.
While there are some sex differences in the epidemiology of ACS, wo-­
men and men receive equal benefit from invasive and non-invasive man-­
agement strategies and, in general, should be managed similarly.

**Diagnostic tools (ECG, troponin, and non-invasive imaging)**
Chest pain/discomfort is the most common symptom initiating the ACS
diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. High-sensitivity troponin measure-­
ments and rapid ‘rule-in’ and ‘rule-out’ algorithms should be used in patients
with suspected NSTE-ACS. MI is not the only condition resulting in cardi-­
omyocyte injury and cardiac troponin elevation, and other conditions
should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Non-invasive imaging
can be useful to increase diagnostic accuracy and optimize risk assessment.

**STEMI management networks**
Co-ordination between EMS and hospitals with common written proto-­
cols is central to the management of STEMI. EMS should transfer patients
immediately to 24/7 high-volume PCI centres regardless of the initial
treatment strategy (PPCI or pre-hospital fibrinolysis). EMS should always
alert the PCI centre immediately after selection of the reperfusion strat-­
egy, and patient transfer to the PCI centre should bypass the ED.

**Invasive strategy and reperfusion therapy**
An invasive strategy is recommended for patients with ACS. Invasive strat-­
egies are time sensitive. For STEMI and very high-risk NSTE-ACS, an im-­
mediate invasive strategy is recommended. For patients with NSTE-ACS
an inpatient invasive strategy is recommended; in NSTE-ACS patients
with high-risk characteristics, an early invasive strategy (<24 h) should
be considered. If timely (within 120 min from time of diagnosis) PPCI can-­
not be performed in patients with STEMI, fibrinolytic therapy is indicated
within 12 h of symptom onset in patients without contraindications.

**Antithrombotic therapy**
Antithrombotic therapy is indicated in all ACS patients, regardless of the
management strategy. This consists of both antiplatelet and anticoagulant
therapy. Aspirin is recommended for all ACS patients at an initial loading
dose and a longer-term maintenance dose. In addition to aspirin, a P2Y 12
receptor inhibitor is recommended, and should be maintained over 12

months unless there are concerns regarding HBR. Regarding P2Y 12 recep-­
tor inhibitor choice, prasugrel and ticagrelor are recommended in prefer-­
ence to clopidogrel, and prasugrel should be considered in preference to
ticagrelor for ACS patients who undergo PCI. Pre-treatment (i.e. treat-­
ment with a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor prior to coronary angiography) in pa-­
tients with NSTE-ACS is not recommended routinely but may be
considered for patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI. Parenteral anticoa-­
gulation is recommended for all patients at the time of diagnosis.
Discontinuation of parenteral anticoagulation should be considered imme-­
diately after the invasive procedure. Some patients with ACS will also have
an indication for long-term OAC, most commonly AF. In these patients,
TAT for up to 1 week, followed by DAT using a NOAC at the recom-­
mended dose for stroke prevention and a single oral antiplatelet agent
(preferably clopidogrel), is recommended as the default strategy.

**ACS with unstable presentation**
A PPCI strategy is recommended in patients with resuscitated cardiac
arrest and an ECG with persistent ST elevation (or ST elevation equiva-­
lents), whereas routine immediate angiography is not recommended in
patients with an ECG without persistent ST elevation (or equivalents).
Temperature control (i.e. continuous monitoring of core temperature
and active prevention of fever [i.e. >37.7°C]) is recommended in pa-­
tients with OHCA who remain unresponsive after ROSC. In patients
with CS complicating ACS, emergency coronary angiography is recom-­
mended, whereas the routine use of IABP in ACS patients with CS and
no mechanical complications is not.

**Early care**
Following reperfusion, it is recommended to admit high-risk ACS patients,
including all STEMI patients, to a CCU/ICCU. ECG monitoring for ar-­
rhythmias and ST-segment changes is recommended for at least 24 h after
symptom onset in all high-risk patients with ACS. It is recommended that
all hospitals participating in the care of high-risk ACS patients have an
ICCU/CCU equipped to provide all required aspects of care including
treatment of ischaemia, severe HF, arrhythmias, and common co
morbidities. It is also recommended that the LVEF is determined before

hospital discharge in all patients with ACS. Discharge of high-risk ACS pa-­
tients within 48–72 h should be considered in selected patients if early re-­
habilitation and adequate follow-up are arranged.

**Technical aspects during PPCI**
Routine radial access and use of DES are the standard of care during PCI
for ACS. Intravascular imaging should be considered to guide PCI and
may be considered in patients with ambiguous culprit lesions.
Routine thrombus aspiration is not recommended. CABG should be
considered in patients with an occluded IRA when PCI is not feasible
or unsuccessful and there is a large area of myocardium in jeopardy.
In patients presenting with SCAD, PCI is recommended only for pa-­
tients with symptoms and signs of ongoing myocardial ischaemia, a large
area of myocardium in jeopardy, and reduced antegrade flow.

**Management of patients with MVD**
For patients with MVD, it is recommended to base the revascularization
strategy (IRA PCI, multivessel PCI/CABG) on the patient’s clinical status
and comorbidities, as well as their disease complexity, according to the
principles of management of myocardial revascularization. For patients
with MVD presenting with CS, IRA-only PCI during the index procedure
is recommended. For patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI, complete re-­
vascularization is recommended either during the index PCI or within 45
days. In patients presenting with NSTE-ACS and MVD, complete revascu-­
larization should be considered, preferably during the index procedure.
For patients with STEMI, it is recommended that decisions regarding


PCI of non-IRA are based on angiographic severity, whereas for patients
with NSTE-ACS, functional invasive evaluation of non-IRA severity during
the index procedure may be considered.

**MINOCA**

The term MINOCA refers to the situation where patients present with
symptoms suggestive of ACS and demonstrate troponin elevation and
non-obstructive coronary arteries at the time of coronary angiography,
i.e. coronary artery stenosis <50% in any major epicardial vessel.
MINOCA is best considered as a working diagnosis that encompasses a
heterogenous group of underlying causes (both cardiac and extra-cardiac)
and is found in 1–14% of patients with ACS. In all patients with an initial
working diagnosis of MINOCA, it is recommended to follow a diagnostic
algorithm to determine the underlying cause. CMR imaging is a key diag-­
nostic tool in patients with a working diagnosis of MINOCA.

**Special patient subsets**
Chronic kidney disease: moderate to severe CKD is present in >30% of
ACS patients. These patients receive less interventional and pharmaco-­
logical treatment and have a worse prognosis in comparison to patients
with normal kidney function. It is recommended to apply the same diag-­
nostic and therapeutic strategies in patients with CKD (dose adjustment
may be necessary) as for patients with normal kidney function.

Older adults: in general, older adults should undergo the same diag-­
nostic and treatment strategies, including invasive angiography and re-­
vascularization, as younger patients.

Patients with cancer: management of ACS in patients with cancer can
be challenging for several reasons, including frailty, increased bleeding
risk, thrombocytopaenia, and increased thrombotic risk. An invasive
strategy is recommended in cancer patients presenting with high-risk
ACS with expected survival ≥6 months. A conservative non-invasive
strategy should be considered in ACS patients with poor cancer prog-­
nosis (with expected survival <6 months) and/or very high bleeding risk.

**Long-term treatment**
Secondary prevention after ACS should be offered to every patient and
should start as early as possible after the index event. This includes car-­
diac rehabilitation, lifestyle management, and pharmacological treat-­
ment, and has been shown to both increase quality of life and
decrease morbidity and mortality.

**Patient perspectives**

Some of the key first steps in the timely diagnosis and treatment of ACS
are reliant on a comprehensive assessment of symptoms. An incom-­
plete history or poorly elicited symptoms can result in delay or misdiag-­
nosis. Patient-centred care is recommended as a critical tenet of

routine clinical management and involves consideration of a patient’s
physical, emotional, and psychological needs.

The provision of care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individ-­
ual patient preferences, needs and values, is important in the manage-­
ment of patients with ACS. It is recommended, as much as possible,
to include ACS patients in decision-making. Preparing for discharge be-­
gins on admission. Educating and informing the patient using the teach
back method and educationally appropriate material should be inte-­
grated into the patient care pathway.

**Quality indicators**
Acute coronary syndrome QIs aim to audit practice and improve clin-­
ical outcomes in real-life patients by demonstrating the gap between
optimal guideline-based treatment and actual care of ACS patients.
Subsequent measures to improve QI attainment can be implemented
based on the local, regional, and global assessment of QIs.

###### **17. Sex differences**

There are currently no data supporting the differential management of
ACS based on sex. However, several studies have reported that wo-­
men presenting with ACS are treated differently than men. [914][–][918]

This includes being less likely than men to receive ICA, timely revascu-­
larization, CR, and secondary prevention medications. [914][–][918]

Healthcare providers and policymakers should be conscious of this
potential gender bias in the management of ACS and make a concerted

effort to ensure that women with ACS receive evidence-based care.


In order to ensure the generalizability of the findings yielded by
RCTs, patient recruitment should be reflective of real-world popula-­
tions from different socioeconomic backgrounds. [919] Several studies
have reported that a disproportionately low proportion of women
are recruited to CV trials. [920][–][922] Alongside historic underrepresentation of other subsets of patients, including older patients
and ethnic minorities, this suggests an underlying recruitment bias. [923]

Increased representation of female patients in future clinical trials is re-­
quired to better inform the optimal management of women with
ACS. [924]

###### **19. Quality indicators**

Quality indicators are tools that can be used to evaluate care quality,
including structures, processes, and outcomes of care. [925] They may
also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to guideline recom-­
mendations, through associated quality improvement initiatives and the
benchmarking of care providers. [926][,][927] As such, the role of QIs in im-­
proving care and outcomes for CVD is increasingly recognized by
healthcare authorities, professional organizations, payers, and the
public. [925]

The ESC understands the need for measuring and reporting quality
and outcomes of CV care and has established methods for the develop-­
ment of the ESC QIs for the quantification of care and outcomes for
CVDs. [925] To date, the ESC has developed QI suites for a number of
CVDs in parallel with the writing of the ESC Clinical Practice
Guidelines. Previous QIs for the management of AMI have been tested
in numerous large registries. [928][–][933] A systematic review of these studies
has shown that there is room for improvement in terms of levels of at-­
tainment of QIs. [934]

The ESC aims to harmonize its QIs for various CV conditions and in-­
tegrate them with ESC registries. [935][,][936] This integrative approach pro-­
vides ‘real-world’ data about the patterns and outcomes of care for
CVD across Europe.
