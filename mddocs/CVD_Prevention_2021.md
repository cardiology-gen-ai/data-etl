### 1. Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management
strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines
and their recommendations should facilitate decision making of
health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and

caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other societies and organizations. Because of their impact on clinical practice,
quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be
found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines).
The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a
given topic and are regularly updated.
In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the
ESC carries out the EURObservational Research Programme of
international registries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions
which are essential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of



providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and
around the world, based on high-quality data collected during routine
clinical practice.
Furthermore, the ESC has developed and embedded in this document a set of quality indicators (QIs), which are tools to evaluate the
level of implementation of the guidelines and may be used by the
ESC, hospitals, healthcare providers and professionals to measure
clinical practice as well as used in educational programmes, alongside
the key messages from the guidelines, to improve quality of care and

clinical outcomes.

The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC,
including representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty
groups, in order to represent professionals involved with the
medical care of patients with this pathology. Selected experts in
the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of a given condition according to ESC
Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPG) policy. A critical
evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the risk�benefit ratio. The level
of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular
management options were weighed and graded according to pre
defined scales, as outlined below.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their
declarations of interest were reviewed according to the ESC dec
laration of interest rules and can be found on the ESC website

[(http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)and have been compiled in a](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
report and published in a supplementary document simultaneously to the guidelines.

This process ensures transparency and prevents potential
biases in the development and review processes. Any changes in
declarations of interest that arise during the writing period were
notified to the ESC and updated. The Task Force received its
entire financial support from the ESC without any involvement
from the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement
process of these guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive
review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions
the guidelines are signed-off by all the experts involved in the Task
Force. The finalized document is signed-off by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The guidelines were developed
after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge
and the evidence available at the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation
of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary
slides, summary cards for non-specialists and an electronic version
for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions are
abridged and thus, for more detailed information, the user should
always access to the full text version of the guidelines, which is freely
available via the ESC website and hosted on the EHJ website. The
National Cardiac Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse,
adopt, translate and implement all ESC Guidelines. Implementation

Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in
the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic
or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines do
not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of
health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in

the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.
### 2. Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease (ASCVD) incidence
and mortality rates are declining in many countries in Europe, but it is
still a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Over the past few decades, major ASCVD risk factors have been identified. The most

ESC Guidelines 3235





![Page 45 Images](CVD_Prevention_2021_images/page_045_images.png)


Figure 1 Central Illustration. ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CKD = chronic kidney disease; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease; CVD = cardiovascular disease


important way to prevent ASCVD is to promote a healthy lifestyle
throughout life, especially not smoking. Effective and safe risk factor
treatments have been developed, and most drugs are now generic
and available at low costs. Nevertheless, the prevalence of unhealthy
lifestyle is still high, and ASCVD risk factors are often poorly treated,
even in patients considered to be at high (residual) CVD risk. [1]

Prevention of CV events by reducing CVD risk is the topic of these
guidelines.

2.1. Definition and rationale

The present guidelines have been developed to support healthcare
professionals in their efforts to reduce the burden of ASCVD in both
individual patients, as well as at a population level. The previous
European Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice were


cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and treatment benefit, as well as
novel treatments and treatment goals, necessitated new, up-to-date
guidelines. The current guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice concentrate principally but not exclusively on the risk factors,
risk classification, and prevention of ASCVD.
The current guidelines provide recommendations on ASCVD prevention to support shared decision-making by the patient and their
healthcare professional based on individual patient characteristics.
Special considerations have been given to differences in age, sex and
gender, life expectancy, risk factor profiles, ethnic, and geographic differences. Estimating CVD risk not only in apparently healthy subjects,
but also in older persons and in patients with established ASCVD or
diabetes mellitus (DM), provides information for tailored intervention on an individual level. Treatment goals can be individualized in a
stepwise approach. ‘Residual’ CVD risk is defined as the risk


Prevention of CV events by reducing CVD risk is the topic of these
guidelines.


2.1. Definition and rationale

The present guidelines have been developed to support healthcare
professionals in their efforts to reduce the burden of ASCVD in both
individual patients, as well as at a population level. The previous
European Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice were
published in 2016. [2] Recent developments in prediction of

3236 ESC Guidelines


estimated after initial lifestyle changes and risk factor treatment, and
is mostly used in patients with established ASCVD. For younger
apparently healthy subjects, lifetime CVD risk estimates are available
to support treatment decisions, replacing 10-year risk algorithms that
consistently estimate low 10-year risk even in the presence of high
risk factor levels. In an ageing population, treatment decisions require
a specific CVD risk score that takes competing non-CVD risk into
account, as well as specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and blood pressure (BP) treatment considerations. Estimating
lifetime benefit in individual patients of smoking cessation, LDL-C
lowering, and BP lowering provides opportunities to communicate
benefit of treatment in an easy-to-understand way. Personalized
treatment decisions using CVD risk estimations and a stepwise
approach to treatment is more complex than a more general onesize-fits-all prevention strategy, but reflects the diversity in patients
and patient characteristics in clinical practice.
Regarding LDL-C, BP, and glycaemic control in patients with DM,
goals and targets remain as recommended in recent European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines. [3][�][5] These prevention
guidelines propose a new, stepwise approach to treatment intensification as a tool to help physicians and patients pursue these targets in
a way that fits patient profile and preferences. Of note, however, new
evidence and/or new consensus may have resulted in some differences with these recent domain-specific ESC Guidelines. New evidence
on antithrombotic treatment regimens for ASCVD prevention is also
presented. Sex-specific aspects are included.
ASCVD prevention needs an integrated, interdisciplinary approach
including input from several disciplines and areas of expertise. We
must work together in a patient- and family-centred way to address
each of the core components of prevention and rehabilitation, including lifestyle modification, psychosocial factors, risk factor treatment,
and social determinants (Central Illustration).

2.2. Development
The Task Force chairs and members were appointed by the ESC
Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPG). Each member of
the Task Force was assigned specific writing tasks, which were
reviewed by other (sub)section writers, the section coordinators,
and the chairs. The text was developed over 11 months, during
which the Task Force members met collectively on three occasions and corresponded intensively between meetings. The
review panel consisted of experts selected by all the scientific
societies that were involved in the development of these guidelines, not only the ESC.

2.3. Cost-effectiveness

The Task Force acknowledge the fact that healthcare budgets are, in
many circumstances, limited and thus that certain recommendations
and goals may not always be attainable. However, the current guidelines do not provide cost-effectiveness analyses. Large national and
regional differences in budgets and costs associated with both interventions and diseases/events preclude valid universal costeffectiveness analyses. However, some recommendations clearly
have financial implications, either in terms of costs for individual
patients and/or in terms of budget impact. Some of these recommendations pertain to diagnosis (e.g. large-scale use of expensive imaging



expensive drugs, such as novel lipid-lowering or anti-diabetic drugs).
For such recommendations, it is inappropriate to ‘unconditionally’
implement them without first considering cost-effectiveness in a
national or regional context or, ideally, to perform formal costeffectiveness analyses with country-specific input parameters and

cost-effectiveness thresholds.

2.4. What is new?

New recommendations, and new and revised concepts, are pre
sented in Table 3.
### 3. Risk factors and clinical conditions

3.1. Target population for assessing
cardiovascular disease risk

CVD risk assessment or screening can be done opportunistically or
systematically. Opportunistic screening, which means screening without a predefined strategy, is done when a person presents for some
other reason. Systematic screening can be done in the general population as part of a formal screening programme, with call and recall of
patients, or in targeted subpopulations such as subjects with type 2
DM, or family history of premature CVD. Systematic screening
results in improvements in risk factors, but has no effect on CVD outcomes. [6][�][9] Opportunistic screening for ASCVD risk factors, such as
BP or lipids, is effective at increasing detection rates and is recommended, although a beneficial effect on clinical outcome is
uncertain. [10]

Structured national programmes aiming to identify undocumented
ASCVD risk factors in adults over 40 years of age without DM or

ASCVD and treat them have shown better risk factor control, but
there are conflicting results as to clinical outcomes. [11][,][12] A high-risk
strategy of inviting the population predicted to be at the highest risk
according to an integrated risk score would be equally effective at
preventing new cases of CVD and have potential cost savings. [13] One
large trial of mobile ultrasound screening for aortic aneurysm, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and hypertension in males aged 65�74
years showed a 7% mortality reduction at 5 years. [14]

A common criticism of screening in general is the potential that
false positive and false negative results may cause harm. However,
evidence on CVD screening shows that those who participate do not
report mental distress. [15][�][18]

Systematic CVD risk assessment assessment in the general population (adult men >40 and women >50 years of age) with no known
CV risk factors appears not cost-effective in reducing subsequent vascular events and premature death, at least in short-term follow-up,

but does increase detection of CV risk factors. Risk assessment is not

a one-time event; it should be repeated, for example, every 5 years,
although there are no empirical data to guide intervals.

3.2. Risk factors and risk classification

3.2.1. Risk factors

The main causal and modifiable ASCVD risk factors are blood

apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins [of which low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is most abundant], high BP, cigarette smoking, and DM.


2.2. Development
The Task Force chairs and members were appointed by the ESC
Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee (CPG). Each member of
the Task Force was assigned specific writing tasks, which were
reviewed by other (sub)section writers, the section coordinators,
and the chairs. The text was developed over 11 months, during
which the Task Force members met collectively on three occasions and corresponded intensively between meetings. The
review panel consisted of experts selected by all the scientific
societies that were involved in the development of these guidelines, not only the ESC.


2.3. Cost-effectiveness

The Task Force acknowledge the fact that healthcare budgets are, in
many circumstances, limited and thus that certain recommendations
and goals may not always be attainable. However, the current guidelines do not provide cost-effectiveness analyses. Large national and
regional differences in budgets and costs associated with both interventions and diseases/events preclude valid universal costeffectiveness analyses. However, some recommendations clearly
have financial implications, either in terms of costs for individual
patients and/or in terms of budget impact. Some of these recommendations pertain to diagnosis (e.g. large-scale use of expensive imaging
tests such as computed tomography), others to interventions (e.g.

even a small absolute reduction in LDL-C may be beneficial in a
high- or very-high-risk patient. [22]

 - [Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) encom-]

passes all atherogenic (apo-B-containing) lipoproteins, and is cal
culated as: total cholesterol � HDL-C = non-HDL-C. The

relationship between non-HDL-C and CV risk is at least as
strong as the relationship with LDL-C. Non-HDL-C levels contain, in essence, the same information as a measurement of apoB plasma concentration. [23][,][24] Non-HDL-C is used as an input in
the Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation 2 (SCORE2) and
SCORE2-Older Persons (SCORE2-OP) risk algorithms.

HDL-C is inversely associated with CVD risk. Very high HDL-C levels
may signal an increased CVD risk. There is, however, no evidence

from Mendelian randomization studies, or randomized trials of cho
lesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, that raising plasma HDL-C
reduces CVD risk. [25][�][28] HDL-C is nonetheless a useful biomarker to

refine risk estimation using the SCORE2 algorithms. The SCORE2
algorithm cannot be used for patients with a genetic lipid disorder,
such as familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Specific LDL-C thresholds and targets are recommended irrespective of estimated CV risk
for patients with FH or other rare/genetic lipid disorders.

3.2.1.2 Blood pressure
Longitudinal studies, genetic epidemiological studies, and RCTs have
shown that raised BP is a major cause of both ASCVD and nonatherosclerotic CVD [particularly heart failure (HF)], accounting for
9.4 million deaths and 7% of global disability adjusted life-years. [29]

Elevated BP is a risk factor for the development of coronary artery
disease (CAD), HF, cerebrovascular disease, lower extremity arterial
disease (LEAD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and atrial fibrillation
(AF). The risk of death from either CAD or stroke increases linearly
from BP levels as low as 90 mmHg systolic and 75 mmHg diastolic
upwards. [30][,][31] The absolute benefit of reducing systolic BP (SBP)
depends on absolute risk and the absolute reduction in SBP, except
that lower limits of SBP are imposed by tolerability and safety considerations. Management is determined by the category of hypertension
(optimal, normal, high-normal, stages 1 to 3, and isolated systolic
hypertension), defined according to seated office BP, ambulatory BP
monitoring (ABPM), or home BP average values (see section
4.7). Evidence suggests that lifetime BP evolution differs in women
compared to men, potentially resulting in an increased CVD risk at
lower BP thresholds. [32][�][34] The SCORE2 algorithm cannot be used
for patients with secondary causes and rarer forms of hypertension,
such as primary hyperaldosteronism.

3.2.1.3 Cigarette smoking
Cigarette smoking is responsible for 50% of all avoidable deaths in

smokers, with half of these due to ASCVD. A lifetime smoker has a

50% probability of dying due to smoking, and on average will lose 10
years of life. [35] The CVD risk in smokers <50 years of age is five-fold
higher than in non-smokers. [36] Prolonged smoking is more hazardous
for women than for men. [37] Worldwide, after high SBP, smoking is
the leading risk factor for disability adjusted life-years. [38] Second-hand
smoke is associated with an increase in CVD risk. [39] Some smokeless
tobacco is also associated with increased risk of CVD. [40]

b Level of evidence.

Another important risk factor is adiposity, which increases CVD risk
via both major conventional risk factors and other mechanisms. In
addition to these, there are many other relevant risk factors, modi
fiers, and clinical conditions, which are addressed under risk modifiers

and clinical conditions (sections 3.3 and 3.4).

3.2.1.1 Cholesterol

The causal role of LDL-C, and other apo-B-containing lipoproteins,
in the development of ASCVD is demonstrated beyond any doubt by
genetic, observational, and interventional studies. [20] The key attrib
utes of LDL-C as a risk factor for ASCVD are:

 - [Prolonged lower LDL-C is associated with lower risk of ASCVD]

throughout the range studied, and the results of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) indicate that lowering LDL-C safely
reduces CVD risk even at low LDL-C levels [e.g. LDL-C <1.4
mmol/L (55 mg/dL)]. [20]

 - [The relative reduction in CVD risk is proportional to the abso-]

lute size of the change in LDL-C, irrespective of the drug(s) used
to achieve such change. [21]

 - [The absolute benefit of lowering LDL-C depends on the abso-]

lute risk of ASCVD and the absolute reduction in LDL-C, so



ESC Guidelines 3243


3.2.1.4 Diabetes mellitus

Type 1 DM, type 2 DM, and prediabetes are independent risk factors
for ASCVD, increasing risk of ASCVD by about two-fold, depending
on the population and therapeutic control. [41] Women with type 2
DM appear to have a particularly higher risk for stroke. [42] Patients
with type 2 DM are likely to have multiple ASCVD risk factors
(including dyslipidaemia and hypertension), each of which mediates

an increase in risk of both ASCVD and non-ASCVD.

3.2.1.5 Adiposity
Over recent decades, body mass index (BMI)—measured as weight
(in kg) divided by squared height (in m [2] )—has increased substantially
worldwide in children, adolescents, and adults. [43] Mendelian random
ization analyses suggest a linear relation between BMI and mortality
in non-smokers and a J-shaped relation in ever-smokers. [44] All-cause

�
mortality is lowest at a BMI of 20 25 kg/m [2] in apparently healthy
people, with a J-shaped or U-shaped relation. [45][,][46] In HF patients,
there is evidence for an obesity paradox, with lower mortality risk in
patients with higher BMI. A meta-analysis concluded that both BMI
and waist circumference are similarly, strongly, and continuously
associated with ASCVD and type 2 DM. [47]

3.2.2. Sex and gender and their impact on health
The current prevention guidelines recognize the importance of integrating sex, gender, and gender identity considerations into the risk
assessment and clinical management of individuals and populations.
These guidelines also acknowledge the complexity of the interrelationship between these concepts and CV, as well as psychological, health. There is, at present, no official ESC position on the specific
terminology to be used. According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), sex ‘refers to the different biological and physiological characteristics of females, males, and intersex persons, such
as chromosomes, hormones and reproductive organs’. [48]

This is to be distinguished from gender, which ‘refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially con
structed. This includes norms, behaviours and roles associated with

being a woman, man, girl or boy, as well as relationships with each
other. As a social construct, gender varies from society to society
and can change over time’. [48] The Global Health 50/50 definition further states that gender refers ‘to the socially constructed norms that
impose and determine roles, relationships, and positional power for
all people across their lifetime’. [49]

Where evidence exists on the risk modifying effect of sex or
where sex-specific clinical conditions and clinical management strategies exist, this has been included in these guidelines. [50] The influence
of gender on an individual’s experience and access to healthcare is
paramount. [50] The specific health concerns related to gender are thus
also acknowledged in these prevention Guidelines.

Epigenetic effects of social constructs appear to condition the
translation of biological sex into disease pathophysiology.

Furthermore, social constructs can also be determinants of health

access, healthcare utilization, disease perception, decision-making,
and perhaps therapeutic response, [50] including in the field of CVD and
ASCVD prevention. Research is ongoing, but gaps in evidence remain
and this has also been recognized in the guidelines.

Examples of specific topics regarding physiological, pathological,



studied include left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF), adverse
drug reactions, trends in ASCVD risk factors and awareness, sex disparities in the management of and outcomes after acute coronary
syndromes (ACS). [51][�][58] Furthermore, CVD health after menopause
transition, pregnancy disorders, and gynaecologic conditions have
recently been reviewed. [59]

3.2.3. Cardiovascular disease risk classification

The current guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice concentrate principally, but not exclusively, on risk and prevention of
ASCVD. This includes risk factors, risk prediction, risk modifiers, as

well as clinical conditions that often increase the likelihood of

ASCVD.

Identifying patients who will benefit most from ASCVD risk factor
treatment is central to ASCVD prevention efforts. In general, the
higher the absolute CVD risk, the higher the absolute benefit of risk

factor treatment, and thus the lower the number needed to treat to
prevent one CVD event during a period of time. [60][,][61] With this in

mind, the estimation of CVD risk remains the cornerstone of these

guidelines and thus appears at the forefront of the proposed manage
ment schemes, which are summarized in flowcharts.

Age is the major driver of CVD risk. Women below 50 years and
men below 40 years of age are almost invariably at low 10-year CVD
risk, but may have unfavourable modifiable risk factors that sharply
increase their longer-term CVD risk. Conversely, men over 65 years
and women over 75 years of age are almost always at high 10-year
CVD risk. Only between the ages of 55 and 75 years in women and
40 and 65 years in men does the 10-year CVD risk vary around commonly used thresholds for intervention. The age categories <50,
50�69, and >_70 years should be used with common sense and flexibility. Different age ranges may be considered for men and women
and may differ according to geographic region. Uncertainty around

risk estimations should also be considered.

CVD risk can also be assessed in patients with type 2 DM and in
patients with established ASCVD. The populations or patient groups
in whom CVD risk needs to be considered are summarized and pre
sented in Table 4. Lifetime CVD risk estimation is available for various

groups of patients, and enables estimation of lifetime benefit from
preventive interventions such as smoking cessation (see section 4.5.1),
lipid-lowering (see section 4.6.2.1), and BP treatment (see section
4.7.5.2). Lifetime risk and benefit estimation may be used for communication in the shared decision-making process, together with consideration of comorbidities, frailty, patient preferences for initiating
(STEP 1) and intensifying (STEP 2) risk factor treatment (Figure 2).

3.2.3.1 A stepwise approach to risk factor treatment and treatment
intensification
As explained before, targets and goals for LDL-C, BP, and glycaemic
control in DM remain as recommended in recent ESC Guidelines. [3][�][5]

These guidelines propose a stepwise approach to treatment intensification as a tool to help physicians and patients pursue these targets in
a way that fits patient profiles and preferences. This principle (outlined in Figure 2, using the example of a stepwise approach) is not
conceptually novel, but rather reflects routine clinical practice, in
which treatment strategies are initiated and then intensified, both as
part of a shared decision-making process involving healthcare professionals and patients.


3.2.1.5 Adiposity
Over recent decades, body mass index (BMI)—measured as weight
(in kg) divided by squared height (in m [2] )—has increased substantially
worldwide in children, adolescents, and adults. [43] Mendelian random

in non-smokers and a J-shaped relation in ever-smokers. [44] All-cause

mortality is lowest at a BMI of 20 25 kg/m [2] in apparently healthy
people, with a J-shaped or U-shaped relation. [45][,][46] In HF patients,
there is evidence for an obesity paradox, with lower mortality risk in
patients with higher BMI. A meta-analysis concluded that both BMI
and waist circumference are similarly, strongly, and continuously
associated with ASCVD and type 2 DM. [47]


3.2.2. Sex and gender and their impact on health
The current prevention guidelines recognize the importance of integrating sex, gender, and gender identity considerations into the risk
assessment and clinical management of individuals and populations.
These guidelines also acknowledge the complexity of the interrelationship between these concepts and CV, as well as psychological, health. There is, at present, no official ESC position on the specific

A stepwise approach starts with prevention goals for all, regardless
of CVD risk. This is followed by CVD risk stratification and discussion
of potential benefits of treatment with the patient. If treatment is initiated, its effect must be evaluated, and subsequent treatment intensification to reach ultimate risk factor goals must be considered in all
patients, taking into account additional benefit, comorbidities, and
frailty, all of which converge with patient preferences in a shared
decision-making process.
In the field of DM, studies have shown benefit of a stepwise
approach to treatment intensification and do not support the contention of ‘therapeutic nihilism’ occurring in either physicians or patients.
In fact, it appears that attainment of treatment goals is similar, sideeffects are fewer, and patient satisfaction is significantly higher with
such an approach. [66][,][67] We do, however, emphasize that stopping
assessment of treatment goals and/or treatment routinely after the
first step is inappropriate. The evidence-based ultimate targets of
treatment intensification are optimal from the perspective of CVD


3.2.3.2 Risk estimation in apparently healthy people
Apparently healthy people are those without established ASCVD,
type 2 DM, or severe comorbidities. In the 2016 ESC prevention
guidelines, [2] the Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) algorithm was used to estimate 10-year risk of CVD death. However,
CVD morbidity (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke)
combined with CVD mortality better reflects the total burden of
ASCVD. The updated SCORE algorithm—SCORE2—used in these
guidelines (see Figure 3), estimates an individual’s 10-year risk of fatal
and non-fatal CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke) in appa
�
rently healthy people aged 40 69 years with risk factors that are
untreated or have been stable for several years. [68]

Several specific considerations apply to CVD risk estimation in
older people. First, the gradient of the relationship between classical
risk factors, such as lipids and BP, with CVD risk attenuates with
age. [69] Second, CVD-free survival dissociates from overall survival
progressively with increasing age, because risk for non-CVD mortality increases (‘competing risk’). [70] For these reasons, traditional risk

CVD mortality, tend to overestimate the actual 10-year risk of CVD,
and hence overestimate the potential benefit of treatment. [71] The
SCORE2-OP algorithm estimates 5-year and 10-year fatal and nonfatal CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke) adjusted for competing risks in apparently healthy people aged >_70 years. [72]

SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP are calibrated to four clusters of coun
tries (low, moderate, high, and very high CVD risk) that are grouped
based on national CVD mortality rates published by the WHO
[(Supplementary Table 3 and Figure 4).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data) [73] Low-risk countries:

can be accessed in the ESC CVD Risk app (freely available from app
stores) and in risk charts for the four clusters of countries (Figure 4).
The SCORE2 charts do not apply to persons with documented CVD
or other high-risk conditions such as DM, FH, or other genetic or
rare lipid or BP disorders, CKD, and in pregnant women.

To estimate a person’s 10-year risk of total CVD events, one must
first identify the correct cluster of countries and the accompanying
risk table for their sex, smoking status, and (nearest) age. Within that
table, one then finds the cell nearest to the person’s BP and nonHDL-C. Risk estimates then need to be adjusted upwards as the person approaches the next age category.

3.2.3.3 Translating cardiovascular disease risk to treatment thresholds
While no risk threshold is universally applicable, the intensity of treatment should increase with increasing CVD risk. In individual cases,
however, no lower threshold of total CVD risk precludes treatment
of risk factors. Conversely, no high threshold for total CVD risk
implies ‘mandatory’ treatment. Across the entire range of CVD risk,

the decision to initiate interventions remains a matter of individual

consideration and shared decision-making (see also section 4.1). In
general, risk factor treatment recommendations are based on

ESC Guidelines 3251


Table 5 Cardiovascular disease risk categories based on
SCORE2 and SCORE2-OP in apparently healthy people
according to age


categories of CVD risk (‘low-to-moderate’, ‘high’, and ‘very high’).
The cut-off risk levels for these categories are numerically different
for various age groups to avoid undertreatment in the young and to
avoid overtreatment in older persons. As age is a major driver of
CVD risk, but lifelong risk factor treatment benefit is higher in
younger people, the risk thresholds for considering treatment are
lower for younger people (Table 5).
Risk categories do not ‘automatically’ translate into recommendations for starting drug treatment. In all age groups, consideration of

risk modifiers, lifetime CVD risk, treatment benefit, comorbidities,

frailty, and patient preferences may further guide treatment

decisions.

Also, note that many patients can move themselves towards a
lower risk category without taking drugs just by stopping smoking.
Finally, note that persons >_70 years old may be at very high risk whilst
being at target SBP, and primary prevention with lipid-lowering drugs
in older persons is a Class IIb (‘may consider’) recommendation; see

section 4.6.

In the 50�69-year age range, a 10-year CVD mortality risk threshold of 5% estimated with the previously used SCORE algorithm corresponds, on average, to a 10-year fatal and non-fatal CVD risk
threshold of 10% estimated with SCORE2, as approximately the
same number of people are above the risk threshold and would qualify for treatment. [68]

a In apparently healthy people >_70 years old, the treatment recommendation for
lipid-lowering drugs is Class IIb (‘may be considered’).
The division of the population into three distinct age groups (<50, 50�69, and
>_70 years) results in a discontinuous increase in risk thresholds for low-to-moderate, high, and very high risk. In reality, age is obviously continuous, and a sensible application of the thresholds in clinical practice would require some flexibility
in handling these risk thresholds as patients move towards the next age group, or
recently passed the age cut-off. Figure 5 illustrates how a continuous increase in
age relates to increasing risk thresholds, and may be used as a guide for daily
practice.

estimated lifetime risk and treatment benefit is considered substantial.

risk, and estimated 10-year CVD risk of almost all individuals >_70
years exceeds conventional risk thresholds. Also, lifetime benefit of
treatment in terms of time gained free of CVD is lower in older people. Therefore, the CVD risk thresholds for risk factor treatment are
higher in apparently healthy people >_70 years. A 10-year CVD risk
>15% is generally considered ‘very high risk’, and treatment of
ASCVD risk factors is recommended (note: the recommendation for
lipid-lowering treatment in apparently healthy people >_70 years is
class IIb; ‘may be considered’; see section 4.6). A 10-year CVD risk of
7.5 to <15% is considered ‘high risk’, and treatment of risk factors
should be considered taking CVD risk modifiers, frailty, lifetime treatment benefit (in low and moderate risk regions, Box 1), comorbidities, polypharmacy, and patient preferences into account. Given the
subjective nature of many of these factors, it is not possible to define
strict criteria for these considerations. A 10-year CVD risk <7.5% is
considered ‘low-to-moderate risk’, and would generally not qualify
for risk factor treatment unless one or several risk modifiers (section
3.3) increase risk or the estimated lifetime risk and treatment benefit
is considered substantial. [75][�][79]

3.2.3.6 Risk estimation and risk factor treatment in apparently healthy
people <50 years of age
Stopping smoking, lifestyle recommendations, and SBP <160 mmHg are
recommended for all (Figure 6). The 10-year CVD risk in relatively
young, apparently healthy people is on average low, even in the presence of high risk factor levels, but the lifetime CVD risk is in these circumstances very high. In apparently healthy people <50 years of age, a
10-year CVD risk >_7.5% is generally considered ‘very high risk’ as this
risk relates to a high lifetime risk, and treatment of ASCVD risk factors
is recommended. A 10-year CVD risk of 2.5 to <7.5% is considered
‘high risk’, and treatment of risk factors should be considered, taking
CVD risk modifiers, lifetime risk and treatment benefit (in low- and



moderate-risk regions), and patient preferences into account. A 10year CVD risk <2.5% is considered ‘low-to-moderate risk’, and would
generally not qualify for risk factor treatment unless one or several risk
modifiers (see section 3.3) increase risk or the estimated lifetime risk and
treatment benefit is considered substantial (see Box 1) (Figure 6). [75][�][78]

In risk communication with younger people, the lifetime benefit
perspective may be useful, as well as discussing the potential of avoiding a devastating CVD event in the short-to-intermediate term,
despite the fact that 10-year CVD risk may be very low.
CVD risk predictions, as well as predictions of lifetime benefit of
risk factor treatment, are likely to be imprecise at very young age
(<40 years). At that age, lipid-lowering and BP-lowering drug treatment are not usually considered, except for patients with FH or specific BP disorders. A healthy lifestyle that is maintained throughout
life is more relevant for the very young. Mendelian randomization
studies illustrate very nicely that relatively small differences in LDL-C
or SBP maintained throughout life have large implications on CVD
risk over a lifespan. [80]

3.2.3.7 Risk estimation and risk factor treatment in patients with estab
lished atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

Patients with clinically established ASCVD are, on average, at very
high risk of recurrent CVD events if risk factors are not treated.
Therefore, smoking cessation, adoption of a healthy lifestyle, and risk
factor treatment is recommended in all patients (STEP 1). Further
intensification of risk factor treatment by aiming at lower treatment
goals (STEP 2) is beneficial in most patients and must be considered,
taking 10-year CVD risk, comorbidities, lifetime risk and treatment
benefit (Box 1), frailty, and patient preferences into account in a
shared decision-making process (Figure 7).

After initial risk factor treatment and the achievement of risk

factor treatment goals, the individual residual risk for recurrent


Box 1. Lifetime CVD risk and treatment benefit estimation

Prevention of CVD by treating risk factors is usually done with a lifetime perspective. Lifetime CVD risk can be approximated by clinical experience with clinical criteria such as age, (change in) risk factor levels, risk modifiers, etc. or estimated in apparently healthy people, patients
with established ASCVD, and persons with type 2 DM with specific lifetime CVD risk scores. [75][�][77] Lifetime benefit from risk factor management can be estimated by combining lifetime risk models with HRs derived from RCTs, meta-analyses of RCTs, or Mendelian randomization
studies, which may provide estimates of the effects of longer-term treatment of risk factors. Online calculators (such as the ESC CVD Risk
app) can be used to estimate the average lifetime benefit of smoking cessation (see also Figure 11), lipid lowering (see also Figure 12), and BP
lowering (see also Figure 15) on an individual patient level expressed as extra CVD-free life-years. [78] Average lifetime benefit is easy to interpret
and may improve the communication of potential therapy benefits to patients in a shared decision-making process. This may in turn increase
patient engagement, self-efficacy, and motivation to adhere to lifestyle changes and drug treatment.

The lifetime risk is an estimate of the age at which there is a 50% probability that a person will either have experienced a CVD event or have
died. Lifetime benefit is the numerical difference between the predicted age at which there is a 50% probability that a person will either have
experienced a CVD event or have died with and without a proposed treatment. Currently there are no formal treatment thresholds for average lifetime benefit. In addition, the estimated individual lifetime benefit should be viewed in the light of the estimated duration of treatment.
Duration of lifelong treatment will generally be longer in young persons compared to older people. Both treatment effect and treatment duration determine the individual ‘return on investment’ of risk factor treatment. In a shared decision-making process between healthcare provider
and patient, the minimum desired benefit of a certain treatment needs to be established, a process in which patient preference, expected

treatment harms, and costs can be taken into account.

treatment benefit is expressed as extra CVD-free life gained from a certain intervention or treatment intensification. See Box 1.

3256 ESC Guidelines


CVD varies widely and should be considered. [81] It is evident that
patients with a recent ACS or progressive vascular disease, and
patients with DM and vascular disease, are all at exceptionally high
risk for recurrent CVD events. For other patients with established
ASCVD, the residual risk may be less evident and could be estimated based on clinical criteria such as age, (change in) risk factor
levels, and risk modifiers, or by calculation of residual CVD risk

with a calculator.

The risk of recurrent CVD is influenced mainly by classical risk factors, vascular disease site, and kidney function. Risk stratification tools
for secondary prevention include the SMART (Secondary
Manifestations of Arterial Disease) risk score (available in the ESC
CVD Risk app) for estimating 10-year residual CVD risk in patients

with stable ASCVD, defined as CAD, PAD, or cerebrovascular disease, [81] and the European Action on Secondary and Primary
Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE) risk
model, which estimates 2-year risk of recurrent CVD in patients with
stable CAD. [82]

Occasionally, recurrent CVD risk is very high despite maximum
(tolerated) conventional treatments. In such cases, novel but less
well-established preventive treatments such as dual antithrombotic
pathway inhibition, [83] icosapent ethyl, [84] or anti-inflammatory therapy
with colchicine (see section 4.10) [85][,][86] may be considered.

3.2.3.8 Risk estimation and risk factor treatment in persons with type 2

diabetes mellitus

Most adults with type 2 DM are at high or very high risk for future
CVD, particularly from middle age onwards. On average, type 2 DM
doubles CVD risk and reduces life expectancy by 4 - 6 years, with
absolute risks highest in those with any target organ damage (TOD).
Type 2 DM also increases the risk for cardiorenal outcomes, in particular HF and CKD. Relative risks (RRs) for CVD in type 2 DM are
higher at younger ages of onset and are modestly higher in women
compared with men. [87] Smoking cessation and adoption of a healthy
lifestyle are recommended for all people with type 2 DM, and risk factor treatment should be considered in all people with DM, at least
those above the age of 40 years (see sections 4.6 and 4.7). Still, there
is a wide range in individual risk for CVD events, especially after initial
risk factor management. [88]

Persons with DM with severe TOD (for definition: see Table 4)
can be considered to be at very high CVD risk, similar to people with
established CVD (see Table 4). Most others with DM are considered
to be at high ASCVD risk. [64] However, an exception can be made for
patients with well-controlled short-standing DM (e.g. <10 years), no
evidence of TOD, and no additional ASCVD risk factors, who may
be considered as being at moderate CVD risk.

In addition to the semi-quantitative division into three risk categories described above, DM-specific risk models may refine risk estimates and illustrate the impact of treatments. These models
generally include duration of DM, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
level, and presence of TOD. Examples are the ADVANCE (Action in
Diabetes and Vascular disease: preterAx and diamicroN-MR
Controlled Evaluation) risk score, which predicts 10-year CVD risk,
and the UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) risk engine, which
predicts fatal and non-fatal CVD risk and is available for use in the

UK. However, we recommend cautious use of these calculators,
since both are based on older cohort data [89][,][90] (Figure 8).

Intensification of risk factor treatment in STEP 2 must be consid
ered in all patients, taking into account 10-year CVD risk, comorbidities, lifetime risk and treatment benefit (Box 1), frailty, and patient
preferences in a shared decision-making process. [75]

3.2.3.9 Risk estimation and risk factor treatment in persons with type 1

diabetes mellitus

People with type 1 DM are at increased CVD risk, and earlier manifestation of type 1 DM relates to more life-years lost in women than men,
mostly due to CVD. [91] RRs of CVD are, on average, higher in type 1 vs.
type 2 DM, due to an average of three to four extra decades of hyperglycaemia, and usual risk factors contribute strongly to CVD outcomes
in type 1 DM. [92] CVD risks have declined over time, commensurate
with improvements in life expectancy. [93] Lifetime CVD risks in type 1
DM are higher with poorer glycaemic control, lower social class, and
younger age of onset. The absolute risk of CVD events or CVD mortality is highest among those with any evidence of microvascular disease, particularly renal complications, and is strongly influenced by age.
CVD risk stratification in persons with type 1 DM may be based on the
same risk classification as for type 2 DM, summarized in Table 4,
although the level of evidence for type 1 DM is weaker.

3.2.4. Communication of cardiovascular disease risk

Reducing CVD risk at the individual level begins with appropriate

assessment of individual risk and effective communication of risk and

anticipated risk reduction by risk factor treatment. Patient-doctor
interactions are complex and communicating risk is challenging. [94][,][95]

There is no single ‘correct’ approach; rather, it will depend on the
individual’s preferences and understanding, which may differ with
education status and numeracy. Risk perception is also strongly
affected by emotional factors such as fear, optimism, etc. (‘patients
don’t think risk, they feel risk’). [96]

It is important to explore whether patients understand their risk,
the anticipated risk reduction, and the pros and cons of intervention,
and to identify what is important to them. For example, one patient
may focus on living free of medications, whereas another may be less
able to change their lifestyle. In terms of outcomes, reducing mortality risk is crucial to some, whereas disease risk is more important to
others. Short-term risk may motivate some patients, whereas lifetime
benefit (see Box 1) will have more impact in others. In general, visual
aids (graphs etc.) improve risk understanding, absolute risk (reduction) is better understood than RR (reduction), and the use of ‘num
bers needed to treat’ is less well understood.

In apparently healthy people, the standard approach is to report
absolute 10-year risk of a CVD event with SCORE2 or SCORE2-OP,
which can be found at the ESC CVD Risk Calculator app (https://
www.escardio.org/Education/ESC-Prevention-of-CVD-Programme/
Risk-assessment/esc-cvd-risk-calculation-app) or at http://
www.heartscore.org or https://www.u-prevent.com. In specific situations, one may opt for expressing risk in terms other than absolute
10-year risk. Examples of such situations include risks in young or
very old people. In young people, lifetime risk might be more informative, as 10-year CVD risk is usually low even in the presence of
risk factors. In older persons, specific risk estimation is required, taking competing non-CVD mortality into account. [78] Direct translation

of RRs to treatment decisions is not recommended, as absolute risk

remains the key criterion for starting treatment.

An alternative way of expressing individual risk is to calculate a person’s ‘risk age’. [96] The risk age of a person with several ASCVD risk
factors is the age of a person of the same sex with the same level of
risk but with low levels of risk factors. Risk age is an intuitive and easily
understood way of illustrating the likely reduction in life expectancy
that a young person with a low absolute but high RR of CVD will be
exposed to if preventive measures are not adopted. Risk age is also
automatically calculated as part of HeartScore (http://www.heartscore.org/). [97][�][99]

CVD risk may also be expressed with a lifetime rather than a 10year horizon, for example, the LIFE-CVD (LIFEtime-perspective
CardioVascular Disease) calculator (ESC CVD Risk Calculation app
or https://www.u-prevent.com) (also see Box 1). [78] Lifetime CVD
risk-prediction models identify high-risk individuals both in the short
and long term. Such models account for predicted risk in the context
of competing risks from other diseases over the remaining expected
lifespan of an individual. A similar approach also employing lifetime
perspective is to calculate lifetime benefit of preventive

interventions. [78] Lifetime benefit of preventive interventions can be
expressed as gain in CVD-free life (years), which is easier to communicate to a patient and may support the shared decision-making

process.

3.3. Potential risk modifiers

Apart from the conventional CVD risk factors included in the risk
charts, additional risk factors or types of individual information can
also modify calculated risk. Assessment of a potential modifier may

be considered if:

 - [It improves measures of risk prediction, such as discrimination or]

reclassification (e.g. by calculation of net reclassification index)

 - [Public health impact is clear (e.g. number needed to screen or]

net benefit)

 - [It is feasible in daily practice]

 - [Information is not just available on how risk increases with an]

unfavourable result, but also on how risk decreases if the modi
fier shows a favourable result

 - [The literature on this potential modifier is not distorted by publi-]

cation bias.

Very few potential modifiers meet all of these criteria. Metaanalyses in this field are, for example, susceptible to substantial publication bias. [106] Also, the exact way of integrating additional information on top of regular risk calculator input parameters is mostly
unknown. Finally, RCTs to determine whether the added risk information eventually leads to improved health outcomes are generally
lacking.

Assessment of potential risk modifiers seems particularly relevant if

the individual’s risk is close to a decision threshold. In low-risk or

very-high-risk situations, additional information is less likely to alter
management decisions. The number of individuals in this ‘grey zone’ is
large. Therefore, feasibility becomes a limitation as modifiers become
more complex or expensive, such as some imaging techniques.
Care should be taken not to use risk modifiers solely to increase
risk estimates when the modifier profile is unfavourable, but also vice
versa. Although an unfavourable risk modifier may increase an individual’s estimated risk, a more favourable profile than would be
expected based on other patient characteristics must have the opposite effect. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that the degree to
which calculated absolute risk is affected by modifiers is generally
much smaller than the (independent) RRs reported for these modifiers in the literature. [107]

Taking the above into account, we summarize the literature on



3.3.1. Psychosocial factors
Psychosocial stress is associated, in a dose-response pattern, with the
development and progression of ASCVD, independently of conventional risk factors and sex. Psychosocial stress includes stress symptoms
(i.e. symptoms of mental disorders), as well as stressors such as loneliness and critical life events. The RRs of psychosocial stress are commonly between 1.2 and 2.0 [108][,][109] [(Supplementary Table 4). Conversely,](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data)
indicators of mental health, such as optimism and a strong sense of purpose, are associated with lower risk. [109] Psychosocial stress has direct
biological effects, but is also highly correlated with socioeconomic and
behavioural risk factors (e.g. smoking, poor adherence). [100][,][109][�][113]

Although the associations of psychosocial stress with CV health are
robust, only ‘vital exhaustion’ has been proven to improve risk reclassification. [101] Owing to the importance of stress symptoms among
ASCVD patients, several guidelines and scientific statements recommend screening of ASCVD patients for psychological stress [113][�][115]

[(Box 2 and Supplementary Table 5). A recent prospective cohort study](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data)
with a median follow-up of 8.4 years reported favourable effects of
screening for depression on major ASCVD events. [102]

3.3.2. Ethnicity
Europe includes many citizens whose ethnic background originates in

countries such as India, China, North Africa, and Pakistan. Given the

considerable variability in ASCVD risk factors between immigrant
groups, no single CVD risk score performs adequately in all groups.
Rather, the use of a multiplying factor would be helpful to take
account of CVD risk imposed by ethnicity independent of other risk
factors in the risk score. The most contemporary relevant data come
from the QRISK3 findings in the UK, [105] although this focuses on a
wider range of CVD outcomes and not simply on CVD mortality.
Immigrants from South Asia (notably India and Pakistan) present
higher CVD rates independent of other risk factors, whereas
adjusted CVD risks appear lower in most other ethnic groups. The
reasons for such differences remain inadequately studied, as do the
risks associated with other ethnic backgrounds. Based on such data,
the following correction factors, based on data from the UK, could
be applied when assessing CVD risk using risk calculators. [105] Ideally,
country and risk-calculator-specific RRs should be used, as the impact
of ethnicity may vary between regions and risk calculators.

 - [Southern Asian: multiply the risk by 1.3 for Indians and]

Bangladeshis, and 1.7 for Pakistanis.

 - [Other Asian: multiply the risk by 1.1.]

 - [Black Caribbean: multiply the risk by 0.85.]

 - [Black African and Chinese: multiply the risk by 0.7.]


3.3. Potential risk modifiers

Apart from the conventional CVD risk factors included in the risk
charts, additional risk factors or types of individual information can
also modify calculated risk. Assessment of a potential modifier may

be considered if:



- [It improves measures of risk prediction, such as discrimination or]

reclassification (e.g. by calculation of net reclassification index)

- [Public health impact is clear (e.g. number needed to screen or]

net benefit)

- [It is feasible in daily practice]

- [Information is not just available on how risk increases with an]

unfavourable result, but also on how risk decreases if the modi
fier shows a favourable result

- [The literature on this potential modifier is not distorted by publi-]

cation bias.


Very few potential modifiers meet all of these criteria. Metaanalyses in this field are, for example, susceptible to substantial publication bias. [106] Also, the exact way of integrating additional information on top of regular risk calculator input parameters is mostly
unknown. Finally, RCTs to determine whether the added risk information eventually leads to improved health outcomes are generally
lacking.

Assessment of potential risk modifiers seems particularly relevant if

the individual’s risk is close to a decision threshold. In low-risk or

very-high-risk situations, additional information is less likely to alter
management decisions. The number of individuals in this ‘grey zone’ is
large. Therefore, feasibility becomes a limitation as modifiers become
more complex or expensive, such as some imaging techniques.
Care should be taken not to use risk modifiers solely to increase
risk estimates when the modifier profile is unfavourable, but also vice
versa. Although an unfavourable risk modifier may increase an individual’s estimated risk, a more favourable profile than would be
expected based on other patient characteristics must have the opposite effect. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that the degree to
which calculated absolute risk is affected by modifiers is generally
much smaller than the (independent) RRs reported for these modifiers in the literature. [107]

Taking the above into account, we summarize the literature on
several popular risk modifiers in this section.


Box 2. Core topics for psychosocial assessment

Simultaneous diagnostic assessment At least one in five patients carries a diagnosis of a mental disorder, usually presenting with bodily
symptoms (e.g. chest tightness, shortness of breath). Therefore, physicians should be equally attentive to somatic as to emotional causes of symptoms.
Screening Screening instruments assessing depression, anxiety, and insomnia are recommended (e.g. Patient
Health Questionnaire, [116] [see Supplementary Table 5).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data) [117][,][118]

Stressors There are simple questions to get into a conversation about significant stressors [112] : Are you bothered by stress at work, financial problems, difficulties in the family, loneliness, or any stressful events?
Need for mental health support Are you interested in a referral to a psychotherapist or mental health service?

ESC Guidelines 3259


3.3.3. Imaging
3.3.3.1 Coronary artery calcium
Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring can reclassify CVD risk
upwards and downwards in addition to conventional risk factors,
and may thus be considered in men and women with calculated
risks around decision thresholds. [103][,][104] Availability and costeffectiveness of large-scale CAC scanning must, however, be considered in a locoregional context (see section 2.3 on costeffectiveness). If CAC is detected, its extent should be compared
with what would be expected for a patient of the same sex and
age. Higher-than-expected CAC increases the person’s calculated
risk, whereas absent or lower-than-expected CAC is associated
with lower than calculated risk. CAC scoring does not provide
direct information on total plaque burden or stenosis severity,
and can be low or even zero in middle-aged patients with soft
non-calcified plaque. Clinicians are advised to consult existing protocols for details of how to assess and interpret CAC scores.

3.3.3.2 Contrast computed tomography coronary angiography
Contrast computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allows
identification of coronary stenoses and predicts cardiac
events. [119] In the SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed
Tomography of the Heart) study, 5-year rates of coronary death
or myocardial infarction were reduced when CCTA was used in
patients with stable chest pain. [120] The relative reduction in myocardial infarction was similar in patients with non-cardiac chest
pain. Whether CCTA improves risk classification or adds prognostic value over CAC scoring is unknown.

3.3.3.3 Carotid ultrasound

Systematic use of intima-media thickness (IMT) to improve risk
assessment is not recommended due to the lack of methodological
standardization, and the absence of added value of IMT in predicting
future CVD events, even in the intermediate-risk group. [121]

Plaque is defined as the presence of a focal wall thickening that is
>_50% greater than the surrounding vessel wall, or as a focal region
with an IMT measurement >_1.5 mm that protrudes into the
lumen. [122] Although the evidence is less extensive than it is for CAC,
carotid artery plaque assessment using ultrasonography probably
also reclassifies CVD risk, [104][,][122] and may be considered as a risk
modifier in patients at intermediate risk when a CAC score is not

feasible.

3.3.3.4 Arterial stiffness
Arterial stiffness is commonly measured using either aortic pulse
wave velocity or arterial augmentation index. Studies suggest that
arterial stiffness predicts future CVD risk and improves risk classification. [123] However, measurement difficulties and substantial publication bias [106] argue against widespread use.

3.3.3.5 Ankle brachial index

Estimates are that 12�27% of middle-aged individuals have an
ankle brachial index (ABI) <0.9, around 50�89% of whom do not
have typical claudication. [124] An individual patient data metaanalysis concluded that the reclassification potential of ABI was
limited, perhaps with the exception of women at intermediate


3.3.3.6 Echocardiography
In view of the lack of convincing evidence that it improves CVD risk
reclassification, echocardiography is not recommended to improve
CV risk prediction.

3.3.4.Frailty
Frailty is a multidimensional state, independent of age and multimorbidity, that makes the individual more vulnerable to the effect of

stressors. It constitutes a functional risk factor for unfavourable out
comes, including both high CV and non-CV morbidity and
mortality. [126][,][127]

Frailty is not the same as ageing and the two should not be confused. The incidence of frailty increases with age, but people of the
same chronological age can differ significantly in terms of health status
and vitality. ‘Biological age’ is much more important in the context of
clinical status (including frailty features) and hard clinical outcomes
(including CVD events). [126][,][127] Similarly, although the presence of
comorbidities can exacerbate frailty within an individual, frailty is not
the same as multimorbidity (see section 6.7).

Frailty screening is indicated in every elderly patient, but should also
be performed in every individual regardless of his/her age, when being
at risk of accelerated ageing. [126][,][127] Most of the tools relate to frail features, including slowness, weakness, low physical activity (PA), exhaustion, and shrinking (e.g. Fried scale, Short Physical Performance
Battery, Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale, handgrip strength, gait
speed). [126][�][129] Frailty assessment is important at each stage of an
ASCVD trajectory. During an acute CVD event, however, frailty
assessment is more difficult, and either relies on history taking or
should be postponed to when patients return to a stable condition.

Frailty is a potential modifier of global CVD risk. The impact of frailty
on CVD risk has been demonstrated across the spectrum of ASCVD,
including people with ASCVD risk factors, patients with subclinical
ASCVD, stable ASCVD, acute cerebral and coronary syndromes, and
HF, [126][�][130] with frailty itself rather than classical CVD risk factors predicting both all-cause and CVD mortality in the very old. [130][,][131]

Importantly, the ability of frailty measures to improve CVD risk prediction has not been formally assessed. Hence, we do not recommend
that frailty measures are integrated into formal CVD risk assessment.

Importantly, frailty may influence treatment. Non-pharmacological
interventions (e.g. balanced nutrition, micronutrient supplementation, exercise training, social activation) aiming to prevent, attenuate,
or reverse frailty are of utmost importance. [126][,][127][,][132] In terms of
pharmacotherapy and device implantations, frailty assessment is not a
method to determine the eligibility for any particular treatment, but
rather serves to build an individualized care plan with predefined priorities. Frail individuals often have comorbidities, polypharmacy, and
may be more susceptible to drug side-effects and serious complications during invasive and surgical procedures. [126][,][127]

3.3.5. Family history
Family history of premature CVD is a simple indicator of CVD risk,
reflecting the genetic and environment interplay. [133] In the few studies
that simultaneously assessed the effects of family history and genetics,
family history remained significantly associated with CVD after adjusting for genetic scores. [134][,][135] However, family history only marginally
improves the prediction of CVD risk beyond conventional ASCVD
risk factors. [136][�][141] Possible explanations are the varying definitions


3.3.3.2 Contrast computed tomography coronary angiography
Contrast computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allows
identification of coronary stenoses and predicts cardiac
events. [119] In the SCOT-HEART (Scottish Computed
Tomography of the Heart) study, 5-year rates of coronary death
or myocardial infarction were reduced when CCTA was used in
patients with stable chest pain. [120] The relative reduction in myocardial infarction was similar in patients with non-cardiac chest
pain. Whether CCTA improves risk classification or adds prognostic value over CAC scoring is unknown.


3.3.3.3 Carotid ultrasound

Systematic use of intima-media thickness (IMT) to improve risk
assessment is not recommended due to the lack of methodological
standardization, and the absence of added value of IMT in predicting
future CVD events, even in the intermediate-risk group. [121]

Plaque is defined as the presence of a focal wall thickening that is
>_50% greater than the surrounding vessel wall, or as a focal region
with an IMT measurement >_1.5 mm that protrudes into the
lumen. [122] Although the evidence is less extensive than it is for CAC,
carotid artery plaque assessment using ultrasonography probably
also reclassifies CVD risk, [104][,][122] and may be considered as a risk
modifier in patients at intermediate risk when a CAC score is not

feasible.


3.3.3.4 Arterial stiffness
Arterial stiffness is commonly measured using either aortic pulse
wave velocity or arterial augmentation index. Studies suggest that
arterial stiffness predicts future CVD risk and improves risk classification. [123] However, measurement difficulties and substantial publication bias [106] argue against widespread use.


3.3.3.5 Ankle brachial index

Estimates are that 12�27% of middle-aged individuals have an
ankle brachial index (ABI) <0.9, around 50�89% of whom do not
have typical claudication. [124] An individual patient data metaanalysis concluded that the reclassification potential of ABI was
limited, perhaps with the exception of women at intermediate
risk. [125]

largely explain the impact of family history.

A family history of premature CVD is simple, inexpensive information that can trigger comprehensive risk assessment in individuals
with a family history of premature CVD. [136]

3.3.6. Genetics

The aetiology of ASCVD has a genetic component, but this information is not currently used in preventive approaches. [142] Advances on
polygenic risk scores for risk stratification could increase the use of
genetics in prevention. [143][�][145] For ASCVD, there is, however, a lack



A family history of premature CVD is simple, inexpensive information that can trigger comprehensive risk assessment in individuals

3.3.6. Genetics

The aetiology of ASCVD has a genetic component, but this information is not currently used in preventive approaches. [142] Advances on
polygenic risk scores for risk stratification could increase the use of
genetics in prevention. [143][�][145] For ASCVD, there is, however, a lack
of consensus regarding which genes and corresponding single nucleotide polymorphisms should be included, and whether to use risk
factor-specific or outcome-specific polygenic risk scores. [146]

Polygenic risk scoring has shown some potential to improve ASCVD
risk prediction for primary prevention, [147][�][149] but the incremental
prediction accuracy is relatively modest and needs further evaluation
in both men and women. [150][,][151] Additional evidence is also needed to

evaluate the clinical utility of polygenic risk scores in other clinical settings, such as in patients with pre-existing ASCVD. [152]


exposure to PM 2.5 ; the long-term effects are associated mainly with
PM 2.5 . The evidence linking exposure to PM and CVD events is based
on large-scale epidemiological studies and experimental studies.
Associations with ASCVD mortality vary, but the majority of cohort
studies link long-term air pollution with an increased risk of fatal or
non-fatal CAD, and with subclinical atherosclerosis. Evidence suggests that reduction of PM 2.5 is associated with improvements in

inflammation, thrombosis, and oxidative stress, and a decrease in
death from ischaemic heart disease. [38][,][160][,][161] As sufficiently precise
individual exposure estimates are hard to obtain, formal risk reclassification is difficult to quantify at present.

b Level of evidence.

3.3.9. Biomarkers in blood or urine

Many biomarkers have been suggested to improve risk stratification.
Some may be causal [e.g. lipoprotein(a), reflecting a pathogenic lipid
fraction], whereas others may reflect underlying mechanisms (e.g. Creactive protein reflecting inflammation) or indicate early cardiac
damage (e.g. natriuretic peptides or high-sensitivity cardiac troponin).
In the 2016 Guidelines, [2] we recommended against the routine use
of biomarkers because most do not improve risk prediction, and publication bias seriously distorts the evidence. [106][,][162] New studies confirm that C-reactive protein has limited additional value. [103] There is
renewed interest in lipoprotein(a), but it too provides limited additional value in terms of reclassification potential. [163][,][164] Cardiac biomarkers are promising, [165][,][166] but further work is needed.

3.3.10. Body composition
Worldwide, BMI has increased substantially in recent decades, in children, adolescents, and adults. [43] In observational studies, all-cause
mortality is minimal at a BMI of 20 - 25 kg/m [2], with a J- or U-shaped
relation in current smokers. [45][,][46] Mendelian randomization analyses
suggest a linear relation between BMI and mortality in never-smokers
and a J-shaped relation in ever-smokers. [44] A meta-analysis concluded
that both BMI and waist circumference are similarly strongly and continuously associated with ASCVD in the elderly and the young and in
men and women. [47]

Among those with established ASCVD, the evidence is contradictory. Systematic reviews of patients with ACS or HF have suggested
an ‘obesity paradox’ whereby obesity appears protective. [167][,][168 169]

However, this evidence should be interpreted with caution as
reverse causality and other biases may be operating. [45]



3.3.7. Socioeconomic determinants

Low socioeconomic status and work stress are independently associated with ASCVD development and prognosis in both sexes. [153][,][154]

The strongest association has been found between low income and
CVD mortality, with a RR of 1.76 [95% confidence interval (CI)
1.45�2.14]. [155] Work stress is determined by job strain (i.e. the combination of high demands and low control at work) and effort-reward
imbalance. There is preliminary evidence that the detrimental impact
of work stress on ASCVD health is independent of conventional risk
factors and their treatment. [156]

3.3.8. Environmental exposure
Environmental exposures with CVD risk modifying potential include
air and soil pollution as well as above-threshold noise levels.
Evaluating individual cumulative exposure to pollutants and noise
remains challenging, but when available, might impact on individual

risk assessment.

Components of outdoor air pollution include airborne particulate
matter [PM; ranging in size from coarse particles 2.5�10 mm in diameter, to fine (<2.5 mm; PM 2.5 ), and ultrafine (<0.1 mm)] and gaseous
pollutants (e.g. ozone, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds,
carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide), produced primarily by combustion of fossil fuels. Soil and water pollutions are also CVD risk modifiers; increased exposure to lead, arsenic, and cadmium is associated
with multiple CVD outcomes including hypertension, coronary heart
disease (CHD), stroke, and CVD mortality. [157] Ambient PM pollution
recently ranked as a leading modifiable mortality risk factor and also
responsible for attributable disability adjusted life-years at the global
level. [158] A recent model estimated that loss of life expectancy due to
ambient air pollution is similar to, if not exceeding, that due to
tobacco smoking, and accounts for a global excess mortality estimated at 8.8 million/year. [159]

The short-term attributable effects on mortality are linked primarily to exposure to PM, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone, with an average
1.0% increase of all-cause mortality for an increment of 10 lg/m [3] in

3.3.10.1 Which index of obesity is the best predictor of cardiovascular

risk?

BMI can be measured easily and is used extensively to define catego[ries of body weight (see Supplementary Table 6). Body fat stored in](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data)
visceral and other ectopic depots carries a higher risk than subcutaneous fat. Several measures of global and abdominal fat are available,
of which waist circumference is the simplest to measure. The WHO
thresholds for waist circumference are widely accepted in Europe.

Two action levels are recommended:

 - [Waist circumference >_94 cm in men and >_80 cm in women: no]

further weight gain

 - [Waist circumference >_102 cm in men and >_88 cm in women:]

weight reduction advised.

Different cut-offs for anthropometric measurements may be
required in different ethnicities.
The phenotype of ‘metabolically healthy obesity’, defined by the
presence of obesity in the absence of metabolic risk factors, has
gained interest. Long-term results support the notion that metabolically healthy obesity is a transient phase moving towards glucometabolic abnormalities rather than a specific ‘state’. [170]

3.3.10.2 Risk reclassification
The associations between BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip
ratio and CVD are maintained after adjustment for conventional risk
factors. However, these measures did not improve CVD risk prediction as assessed by reclassification. [47]

3.3.10.3 Assess risk factors and cardiovascular disease risk in persons
with obesity
Comprehensive CVD risk assessment should be considered in individuals with unfavourable body composition. The main risk-related sequalae of adiposity include hypertension, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance,
systemic inflammation, a prothrombotic state, albuminuria, as well as a
decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [171] and the development of type 2 DM, CVD events, as well as HF and AF.

3.4. Clinical conditions

Individual calculated risks of CVD, as evaluated by conventional risk
factors in risk scores, are subject to refinement by potential risk
modifiers as highlighted in section 3.3. Beyond these potential modifiers, specific clinical conditions can influence CVD risk. These clinical

conditions often increase the likelihood of CVD, or are associated

with poorer clinical prognosis. The current section reviews some of

these conditions, which are not often included in traditional risk

scores but may be integrated in some national risk scores. Here we

discuss how these conditions increase this risk.

Many clinical conditions share common CVD and ASCVD risk factors and therefore treating these allows a synergistic reduction in the

overall burden of disease.

3.4.1. Chronic kidney disease
Worldwide, the total number of individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are not treated with kidney replacement therapy
was approximately 850 million in 2017. [194] This number accounts to a
prevalence of 10 - 12% among men and women. CKD is the third
fastest growing cause of death globally. [195]

CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function,
present for >3 months, with health implications. Criteria and markers
of kidney damage, especially kidney disease due to DM, are albuminuria [albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >30 mg/g in spot urine specimens] and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m [2] .
GFR can be estimated (eGFR) from calibrated serum creatinine and
estimating equations using the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease
Epidemiology) Collaboration formula. Kidney disease severity is differentiated into stages (categories) according to the level of GFR and
albuminuria; a patient with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m [2] is classified
as having CKD stage 3a, which represents an advanced kidney function impairment. [172]

Among persons with CKD, CVD is the leading cause of morbidity
and death. [196] Even after adjustment for known CAD risk factors, including DM and hypertension, mortality risk progressively increases with
worsening CKD. [197] As GFR declines below approximately 60- 75 mL/
min/1.73 m [2], the probability of developing CAD increases linearly, [198]

with up to triple the CVD mortality risk when reaching an eGFR of 15
mL/min/1.73 m [2] . Kidney disease is associated with a very high CVD risk.
Among persons with CKD, there is a high prevalence of traditional
CAD risk factors, such as DM and hypertension. The use of CAC score
to risk stratify patients with CKD might be a promising tool. [199][�][203]

Furthermore, persons with CKD are also exposed to other nontraditional ASCVD risk factors such as uraemia-related ones, including
inflammation, oxidative stress, and promotors of vascular calcification.
CKD and kidney failure not only increase the risk of CAD, they also



3.4.2. Atrial fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation (AF) appears to be associated with an increased risk
of death and of CVD and kidney disease. [205] Furthermore, AF appears
to be a stronger risk factor for CVD in women than in men. [206]

The prevalence of AF ranges between 2% and 4%, and a 2.3-fold
rise is expected, owing in part to ageing of the population and intensified searching for undiagnosed AF, as well as lower CV death. [207] The
age-adjusted incidence, prevalence, and lifetime risk of AF are lower
in women vs. men and in non-white vs. white cohorts. [208][,][209] The life
time AF risk estimate is now 1 in 3 individuals of European ancestry
at an index age of 55 years. [210] ASCVD risk factor burden and comorbidities, including lifestyle factors, and age significantly affect the lifetime risk for AF development. [211][�][213] The observed effect of clinical
ASCVD risk factor burden and multiple comorbidities on the lifetime
risk of AF (significantly increasing from 23.4% among individuals with
an optimal clinical risk factor profile to 33.4% and 38.4% in those with
borderline and elevated clinical risk factors, respectively [214] ) suggests
that early intervention and control of modifiable ASCVD risk factors
could reduce incident AF. The continuum of unhealthy lifestyle, risk
factor(s), and CVDs can contribute to atrial remodelling/cardiomyopathy and development of AF that commonly results from a combined effect of multiple interacting factors (Figure 9). [215] Risk factor
and CVD management reduces AF burden. Targeted therapy of
underlying conditions may significantly improve maintenance of sinus
rhythm in patients with persistent AF and HF. [216] However, studies
addressing isolated management of specific conditions alone (e.g.
hypertension) yielded inconsistent findings. [217]

The overall annual risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with AF is
5%, but varies considerably according to comorbidities. [215]

Cardioembolic strokes associated with AF are usually more severe,
and often recurrent. [218] Furthermore, AF appears to be a stronger
predictor of stroke in women than in men. [215] AF is also associated
with impaired cognitive function, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. [219] AF is independently associated with a two-fold
increased risk of all-cause mortality in women and a 1.5-fold
increased risk in men. [220] In one population, the most common causes
of death were HF (14.5%), malignancy (23.1%), and infection/sepsis
(17.3%), while stroke-related mortality was only 6.5%. [221] These data
indicate that, in addition to anticoagulation and HF treatment, comorbid conditions need to be actively treated to reduce AF-related mortality and morbidity.

Regarding PA, both sedentary lifestyles and very high levels of PA
are associated with development of AF (U-shaped association),
through different mechanisms. Furthermore, when AF develops in

athletes it is not associated with the same increased risk of stroke.

3.4.3. Heart failure

Heart failure (HF) of ischaemic origin constitutes a severe clinical
manifestation of ASCVD. Conversely, HF itself (predominantly of
ischaemic aetiology) increases the risk of CVD events (myocardial
infarction, arrhythmias, ischaemic stroke, CV death).
Asymptomatic LV dysfunction (systolic or/and diastolic dysfunction) as well as overt symptomatic HF [across the spectrum of LVEF,
i.e. HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mid-range
ejection fraction, [222] and HF with preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF)] increases the risk of urgent CV hospitalizations (including
hospitalizations due to HF worsening) and CV and all-cause deaths.


3.4. Clinical conditions

Individual calculated risks of CVD, as evaluated by conventional risk
factors in risk scores, are subject to refinement by potential risk
modifiers as highlighted in section 3.3. Beyond these potential modifiers, specific clinical conditions can influence CVD risk. These clinical

conditions often increase the likelihood of CVD, or are associated

with poorer clinical prognosis. The current section reviews some of

these conditions, which are not often included in traditional risk

scores but may be integrated in some national risk scores. Here we

discuss how these conditions increase this risk.

Many clinical conditions share common CVD and ASCVD risk factors and therefore treating these allows a synergistic reduction in the

overall burden of disease.


3.4.1. Chronic kidney disease
Worldwide, the total number of individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are not treated with kidney replacement therapy
was approximately 850 million in 2017. [194] This number accounts to a
prevalence of 10 - 12% among men and women. CKD is the third
fastest growing cause of death globally. [195]

CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function,
present for >3 months, with health implications. Criteria and markers
of kidney damage, especially kidney disease due to DM, are albuminuria [albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >30 mg/g in spot urine specimens] and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m [2] .
GFR can be estimated (eGFR) from calibrated serum creatinine and
estimating equations using the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease
Epidemiology) Collaboration formula. Kidney disease severity is differentiated into stages (categories) according to the level of GFR and
albuminuria; a patient with an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m [2] is classified
as having CKD stage 3a, which represents an advanced kidney function impairment. [172]

Among persons with CKD, CVD is the leading cause of morbidity
and death. [196] Even after adjustment for known CAD risk factors, including DM and hypertension, mortality risk progressively increases with
worsening CKD. [197] As GFR declines below approximately 60- 75 mL/
min/1.73 m [2], the probability of developing CAD increases linearly, [198]

with up to triple the CVD mortality risk when reaching an eGFR of 15
mL/min/1.73 m [2] . Kidney disease is associated with a very high CVD risk.
Among persons with CKD, there is a high prevalence of traditional
CAD risk factors, such as DM and hypertension. The use of CAC score
to risk stratify patients with CKD might be a promising tool. [199][�][203]

Furthermore, persons with CKD are also exposed to other nontraditional ASCVD risk factors such as uraemia-related ones, including
inflammation, oxidative stress, and promotors of vascular calcification.
CKD and kidney failure not only increase the risk of CAD, they also
modify its clinical presentation and cardinal symptoms. [204]

These unfavourable effects on clinical outcomes have been demon
strated in asymptomatic subjects without overt CVD, in patients with
acute and previous myocardial infarction, in patients with acute and
previous stroke, and in patients with other clinical manifestations of
CVD. [223]

The diagnosis of ischaemic HF positions individuals at very high CV
risk, and justifies recommendations as for secondary prevention therapeutic strategies. Additionally, for patients with symptomatic HFrEF,
several drugs are recommended to reduce the risk of CV morbidity
and mortality (see section 6.2).

3.4.4. Cancer

In patients with cancer, there is an overlap between cancer and
ASCVD risk factors, with shared biological mechanisms and genetic



beneficial in reducing both CVD as well as cancer risk. Moreover, the
rates of the extent of CVD risk depend on both the CVD toxicity of
treatments and patient-related factors. Owing to recent improvements in clinical outcomes for many patients with cancer, CVD mortality may ultimately exceed those from most forms of cancer
recurrence. [224][,][225]

The rapidly expanding variety of novel anticancer drugs/adjuvant
therapies has demonstrated a wide range of both early and late CVD
side-effects, including cardiomyopathy, LV dysfunction, HF, hypertension, CAD, arrhythmias, and other injuries. Therefore, effective strategies for the prediction and prevention of CVD toxicities are
critically important. The latency and severity of radiotherapy cardiotoxicity, as well as accelerated atherosclerosis and cerebral vascular
disease, is related to multiple factors, including the dose (total per
fraction), the volume of the heart irradiated, concomitant

administration of other cardiotoxic drugs, and patient factors (which
include, amongst other factors, younger age, traditional risk factors,
and history of heart disease). [226][,][227] Furthermore, radio- and chemotherapy may exert direct vascular effects and increase
atherosclerosis-related CVD outcomes. [227][,][228]

3.4.4.1 Diagnosis and screening
Signs or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction should be monitored
before and periodically during and after cancer treatment for early
detection of abnormalities in patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Detection of subclinical abnormalities using
imaging and measurement of circulating biomarkers (such as cardiac
troponins and natriuretic peptides) is currently recommended. [173][,][229]

Measures of myocardial strain, particularly systolic global longitudinal
strain, may precede a significant decline in LVEF. [230][�][233]

3.4.4.2 Prevention of cardiotoxicity and cardiovascular risk factors
RCTs of preventive therapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and/or beta-blockers after trastuzumab or
anthracyclines have reported contradictory results. [230][,][234][,][235] The
main benefits are less marked LV remodelling or a reduced decline in
LVEF observed with cardiac magnetic resonance, but translation into
better outcomes remains speculative.

Exercise should be strongly advised. In particular, aerobic exercise is
considered a promising non-pharmacological strategy to prevent and/
or treat chemotherapy toxicity. [236] A study showed a significantly
higher risk of CVD in survivors of childhood cancer than in non-cancer
adult controls, and particularly in survivors of adult-onset cancer with
underlying ASCVD risk factors. [237] Therefore, aggressive management
of ASCVD risk factors in this population is recommended.

3.4.5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex, progressive respiratory disorder and currently the fourth leading cause
of death worldwide. It is characterized by chronic airflow limitation
with respiratory symptoms and is associated with an increased
inflammatory response and abnormalities of the airways caused by
significant exposure to noxious particles or gases (mainly smoking).
Although COPD is recognized and thoroughly investigated as a CVD
comorbidity, its role as an ASCVD risk factor is not well established.
Nevertheless, COPD patients have a two- to three- fold increased
risk of CVD compared with age-matched controls when adjusted for
tobacco smoking. Patients with mild-to-moderate COPD are 8�10
times more likely to die from ASCVD than respiratory failure, having
higher rates of hospitalization and death due to CVD, stroke, and
HF. [238][,][239] CVD also runs undiagnosed; less than one-third of COPD
patients with electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of myocardial
infarction are diagnosed with CVD. [240] CVD mortality increases by
28%, and the frequency of non-fatal coronary events by 20%, for
every 10% decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second
(FEV1). [241] Acute COPD exacerbations, mainly due to infections, are
frequent and are responsible for a four-fold increase of CVD
events. [242] The risk of both myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke
is increased during the 3 months after an acute exacerbation. [243]

The high prevalence of CVD in COPD patients may be explained
by the fact that both diseases share common risk factors, such as



syndrome and reduced PA is present in 34% of COPD patients, with
its most prevalent components being hypertension (56%), abdominal
obesity (39%), and hyperglycaemia (44%). [245] CVD may be caused by
hypoxia during exercise due to lung hyperinflation, high resting heart
rates, impaired vasodilatory capacity, and peripheral, cardiac, and
neurohumoral sympathetic stress. Atherosclerosis and coronary
artery calcification may be the result of oxidative stress, and reductions in antiaging molecules causing both lung and vascular ageing. [246]

Systemic inflammation is prominent in COPD, with circulating biomarkers in high concentrations and associated with increased mortality. [247] Troponin is elevated during an acute exacerbation of COPD,
and 10% of hospitalized patients meet the definition of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). [248] B-natriuretic peptide level, if elevated,
increases the mortality risk. [249]

Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress caused by COPD promote vascular remodelling, stiffness, and atherosclerosis, and induce
a ‘procoagulant’ state that affects all vasculature types. [250] Cognitive
impairment and dementia due to cerebral microvascular damage is
correlated with COPD severity; patients have a 20% increased risk
for both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, which may be up to
seven-fold higher following an acute exacerbation. [251] PAD is present
in about 9% of COPD patients, [252] who have an almost doubled risk
of developing PAD, [253] as well as an increased prevalence of carotid
plaques related to the disease severity. [254] Finally, COPD is positively
associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm, regardless of smoking
status. [255]

Cardiac arrhythmias are common and may be due to the haemodynamic effects (pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, atrial
structural, and electrical remodelling) caused by the disease in combination with autonomic imbalance and abnormal ventricular repolarization. [256] AF is frequent, directly associated with FEV1, usually
triggered by acute exacerbations of COPD, and an independent predictor of in-hospital COPD mortality. [257][,][258] COPD is also a risk factor for ventricular tachycardia independent of LVEF, [259] and for
sudden cardiac death independent of CVD risk profile. [260]

Unrecognized ventricular dysfunction is common in COPD, [261]

although HF is 3.8 times more common in COPD patients than in
controls. [262] Patients with frequent acute exacerbations have a high
frequency of diastolic dysfunction; HFpEF risk is higher because of a
high prevalence of hypertension and DM. [263]

Considering these facts, it seems of upmost importance to screen
COPD patients for ASCVD and ASCVD risk factors, bearing in mind
that COPD affects the accuracy of CVD diagnostic tests. Achieving
adequate exercise is difficult, vasodilators for myocardial perfusion
scanning may be contraindicated because of the risk of bronchospasm, and stress or transthoracic echocardiography is often disturbed by poor ultrasound windows. Computed tomography
coronary angiography or magnetic resonance imaging may be alternatives, but remain expensive, time consuming, and not always

available.

The use of COPD medications (i.e. long-acting muscarinic antagonists and long-acting beta agonists) is not associated with overall CV
adverse events in patients with stable COPD. Olodaterol may reduce
the risk of overall CV adverse events and formoterol may decrease
the risk of cardiac ischaemia. Long-acting beta agonists may reduce
the incidence of hypertension, but may also increase the risk of HF,
so should be used with caution in HF patients. [264]


3.4.4.1 Diagnosis and screening
Signs or symptoms of cardiac dysfunction should be monitored
before and periodically during and after cancer treatment for early
detection of abnormalities in patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Detection of subclinical abnormalities using
imaging and measurement of circulating biomarkers (such as cardiac
troponins and natriuretic peptides) is currently recommended. [173][,][229]

Measures of myocardial strain, particularly systolic global longitudinal
strain, may precede a significant decline in LVEF. [230][�][233]


3.4.4.2 Prevention of cardiotoxicity and cardiovascular risk factors
RCTs of preventive therapy with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and/or beta-blockers after trastuzumab or
anthracyclines have reported contradictory results. [230][,][234][,][235] The
main benefits are less marked LV remodelling or a reduced decline in
LVEF observed with cardiac magnetic resonance, but translation into
better outcomes remains speculative.

Exercise should be strongly advised. In particular, aerobic exercise is
considered a promising non-pharmacological strategy to prevent and/
or treat chemotherapy toxicity. [236] A study showed a significantly
higher risk of CVD in survivors of childhood cancer than in non-cancer
adult controls, and particularly in survivors of adult-onset cancer with
underlying ASCVD risk factors. [237] Therefore, aggressive management
of ASCVD risk factors in this population is recommended.


3.4.5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex, progressive respiratory disorder and currently the fourth leading cause
of death worldwide. It is characterized by chronic airflow limitation
with respiratory symptoms and is associated with an increased
inflammatory response and abnormalities of the airways caused by
significant exposure to noxious particles or gases (mainly smoking).
Although COPD is recognized and thoroughly investigated as a CVD
comorbidity, its role as an ASCVD risk factor is not well established.
Nevertheless, COPD patients have a two- to three- fold increased
risk of CVD compared with age-matched controls when adjusted for
tobacco smoking. Patients with mild-to-moderate COPD are 8�10
times more likely to die from ASCVD than respiratory failure, having
higher rates of hospitalization and death due to CVD, stroke, and
HF. [238][,][239] CVD also runs undiagnosed; less than one-third of COPD
patients with electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of myocardial
infarction are diagnosed with CVD. [240] CVD mortality increases by
28%, and the frequency of non-fatal coronary events by 20%, for
every 10% decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second
(FEV1). [241] Acute COPD exacerbations, mainly due to infections, are
frequent and are responsible for a four-fold increase of CVD
events. [242] The risk of both myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke
is increased during the 3 months after an acute exacerbation. [243]

The high prevalence of CVD in COPD patients may be explained
by the fact that both diseases share common risk factors, such as
smoking, ageing, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. [244] Metabolic

ESC Guidelines 3265


3.4.6. Inflammatory conditions
Inflammatory conditions increase CVD risk both acutely and over
time. The best evidence for chronic inflammation increasing CVD
risk is available for rheumatoid arthritis, which increases CVD risk by
approximately 50% beyond established risk factors. [176] Hence, a low
threshold for assessment of total CVD risk is appropriate in adults
with rheumatoid arthritis, and one should consider increasing the risk
estimate based on the level of disease activity. [176] There is also evidence for an approximately 20% increased CVD risk in patients with
active inflammatory bowel disease. [265]

In other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis [177] and
ankylosing spondylitis, [178] CVD risk may also be increased. However,
the strength of the evidence is less strong, as is the independence of

such increased risks from the classical ASCVD risk factors.

Nonetheless, it seems prudent to at least consider CVD risk assessment in patients with any chronic inflammatory condition, and to
take into account the presence of such conditions when there is
doubt regarding initiation of preventive interventions. The cumulative
disease burden and recent degree of inflammation are important
determinants of the risk-enhancing effect.

Apart from optimal anti-inflammatory treatment, CVD risk in
inflammatory conditions should be treated with similar interventions
as in the general high-risk population, as there is evidence that traditional methods to lessen risk (e.g. lipid-lowering treatment) are just
as beneficial in preventing ASCVD.

3.4.7. Infections (human immunodeficiency virus,
influenza, periodontitis)
Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated
with a 19% increased risk of LEAD and CAD beyond that explained
by traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. [266][,][267] However, for those
with sustained CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm [3], the risk of incident

LEAD events is nearly two-fold higher, whereas for those with sustained CD4 cell counts >_500 cells/mm [3], there is no excess risk of
incident LEAD events compared with uninfected people. [268]

CVD and influenza have long been associated, due to an overlap in
the peak incidence of each disease during winter months.
Epidemiological studies have noted an increase in CV deaths during
influenza epidemics, indicating that CV complications of influenza
infection, including acute ischaemic heart disease and, less often,
stroke, are important contributors to morbidity and mortality during

influenza infection.

The risk of AMI or stroke is more than four times higher after a
respiratory tract infection, with the highest risk in the first 3 days after
diagnosis. [269] Preventing influenza, particularly by means of vaccination, could prevent influenza-triggered AMI. [270]

Studies have linked periodontal disease to both atherosclerosis and
CVD, [271][�][273] and serological studies have linked elevated antibody titres
of periodontal bacteria to atherosclerotic disease. [274] Nevertheless, if
active treatment or prevention of periodontitis improves, clinical prognosis requires further studies despite preliminary evidence. [275][�][277]

3.4.8. Migraine
Migraine is a highly prevalent condition affecting around 15% of the
general population. [278] There are two main types of migraine—



migraine with aura, which accounts for about one-third of all
migraines; in many patients the two forms coexist.
Available data indicate that migraine overall is associated with a

two-fold increased risk of ischaemic stroke and a 1.5-fold increase in
the risk of cardiac ischaemic disease. [179][�][181][,][279][,][280] The associations
are more evident for migraine with aura. [179][,][180][,][280] Given the young
mean age of the population affected by migraine, the absolute
increase in risk is small at the individual level, but high at the population level because of the high migraine prevalence. [281]

Several lines of evidence also indicate that the vascular risk of subjects with migraine may be magnified by cigarette smoking [182] and by the
use of combined hormonal contraceptives. [183][,][281][�][283] Contraception
using combined hormonal contraceptives should therefore be avoided
in women with migraine. [282][,][283] However, further information is needed
as good-quality studies assessing risk of stroke associated with lowdose oestrogen use in women with migraine are lacking.

3.4.9.Sleep disorders and obstructive sleep apnoea
Sleep disturbances or abnormal sleep durations are associated with
increased CVD risk. [284][�][286] Regarding sleep duration, 7 h seems to
be optimal for CV health. [287]

In the general population, the prevalence of general sleep disturbances is around 32.1%: 8.2% for insomnia, 6.1% for parasomnia,
5.9% for hypersomnolence, 12.5% for restless legs disorder and limb
movements during sleep, and 7.1% for sleep-related breathing disorder [e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)]. [288] All sleep disturbances
are strongly associated with mental disorders and share hyperarousal
as an underlying mechanism. [289][,][290]

The most important sleep-related breathing disorder is OSA,
which is characterized by repetitive episodes of apnoea, each exceeding 10 seconds. Despite the strong associations of OSA with CVD,
including hypertension, stroke, HF, CAD, and AF, treatment of OSA
by positive airway pressure (PAP) has failed to improve hard CV outcomes in patients with established CVD. [291][�][293] Therefore, interventions that include behaviour change (reduction of obesity, alcohol
abstinence), sleep hygiene, and stress reduction in addition to PAP are
needed. [290][,][294] Regarding hypertension and OSA, there are modest
effects of PAP on BP levels, but only in patients with ABPM-confirmed
resistant hypertension who use PAP for more than 5.8 h/night. [295]

3.4.10. Mental disorders

The 12-month prevalence of mental disorders or mental health disorders in the general European population is between 27% and 38%
depending on sources and definitions. [296] All mental disorders (e.g.
anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, substance disorders, personality disorders, mood disorders, and psychotic disorders) are
associated with the development of CVD and reduced life expectancy in both sexes. [297][�][300] The risk increases with the severity of the
mental disturbance and vigilance for (often non-specific) symptoms is
crucial. [301] The onset of CVD is associated with an approximately
2�3-fold increased risk of mental disorders compared to a healthy
population. [115][,][302] In this context, screening should be performed at

�
every consultation (or 2 4 times/year). The 12-month prevalence of
mental disorders in CVD patients is around 40%, leading to significantly worse prognosis. [100][,][108][,][303][,][304] The onset of CVD increases the
risk of committing suicide. [305] In this context, awareness of anxiety
and depression symptoms should be increased.


In other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis [177] and
ankylosing spondylitis, [178] CVD risk may also be increased. However,
the strength of the evidence is less strong, as is the independence of

such increased risks from the classical ASCVD risk factors.

Nonetheless, it seems prudent to at least consider CVD risk assessment in patients with any chronic inflammatory condition, and to
take into account the presence of such conditions when there is
doubt regarding initiation of preventive interventions. The cumulative
disease burden and recent degree of inflammation are important
determinants of the risk-enhancing effect.

Apart from optimal anti-inflammatory treatment, CVD risk in
inflammatory conditions should be treated with similar interventions
as in the general high-risk population, as there is evidence that traditional methods to lessen risk (e.g. lipid-lowering treatment) are just
as beneficial in preventing ASCVD.


3.4.7. Infections (human immunodeficiency virus,
influenza, periodontitis)
Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated
with a 19% increased risk of LEAD and CAD beyond that explained
by traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. [266][,][267] However, for those
with sustained CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm [3], the risk of incident

LEAD events is nearly two-fold higher, whereas for those with sustained CD4 cell counts >_500 cells/mm [3], there is no excess risk of
incident LEAD events compared with uninfected people. [268]

CVD and influenza have long been associated, due to an overlap in
the peak incidence of each disease during winter months.
Epidemiological studies have noted an increase in CV deaths during
influenza epidemics, indicating that CV complications of influenza
infection, including acute ischaemic heart disease and, less often,
stroke, are important contributors to morbidity and mortality during

influenza infection.

The risk of AMI or stroke is more than four times higher after a
respiratory tract infection, with the highest risk in the first 3 days after
diagnosis. [269] Preventing influenza, particularly by means of vaccination, could prevent influenza-triggered AMI. [270]

Studies have linked periodontal disease to both atherosclerosis and
CVD, [271][�][273] and serological studies have linked elevated antibody titres
of periodontal bacteria to atherosclerotic disease. [274] Nevertheless, if
active treatment or prevention of periodontitis improves, clinical prognosis requires further studies despite preliminary evidence. [275][�][277]


3.4.8. Migraine
Migraine is a highly prevalent condition affecting around 15% of the
general population. [278] There are two main types of migraine—
migraine without aura, which is the most common subtype, and

3266 ESC Guidelines


The precise mechanism by which mental disorders increase CVD
remains uncertain. The detrimental effects are potentially caused by
unhealthy lifestyle, increased exposure to socioeconomic stressors,
and cardiometabolic side-effects of some medications, [113] but also by
direct effects of the amygdala-based fear-defence system and other
direct pathophysiological pathways. [303] Abuse of psychostimulants
(e.g. cocaine) is a powerful trigger of myocardial ischaemia. [306]

Further, the capacity of these patients to adaptively use the healthcare systems is impaired due to their mental condition (e.g. not being
able to trust other people and seek help, impaired capacity to be
adherent). [100] Barriers on the part of healthcare providers are stigmatizing attitudes, insufficient mental health literacy, and lack of confidence in mental healthcare. [307][�][309] Although patients with mental
disorders have an increased CVD risk, they receive a lower rate of
recognition and treatment of traditional ASCVD risk factors. [310]

Preliminary evidence suggests that taking mental disorders into
account improves classical CVD risk models. [311][,][312]

Certain categories of patients with learning difficulties and associated disorders (such as Down’s syndrome) are at increased risk of
CVD disease, but perhaps not specifically ASCVD. However, health
inequalities and the prevalence of CV risk factors may be greater in
these populations, although epidemiology research is scarce.

3.4.11. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with
an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. NAFLD represents accumulation of ectopic fat; persons with NAFLD are often
overweight or obese, and not uncommonly have abnormal BP, glucose, and lipid levels. A recent study investigating whether NAFLD
increases CV risk beyond traditional risk factors [313] shows that after
adjusting for established risk factors, the associations did not persist.
Nevertheless, patients with NAFLD should have their CVD risk calculated, be screened for DM, and be recommended a healthy lifestyle

with a reduction of alcohol intake.

3.4.12. Sex-specific conditions

3.4.12.1 Obstetric conditions

Pre-eclampsia (defined as pregnancy-related hypertension accompa
�
nied by proteinuria) occurs in 1 2% of all pregnancies and is associated

�
with an increase in CVD risk by a factor of 1.5 2.7 compared with all
women, [185][,][186][,][314] while the RR of developing hypertension is 3 [187] and
DM is 2. [184][,][185] It has not been established whether the increased CVD

risk after preeclampsia occurs independently of CV risk factors. The
rationale for screening these women for the occurrence of hypertension and DM is, however, quite strong. At present, no separate risk
model for women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy seems necessary, despite their higher baseline risk. [315]

�
Pregnancy-related hypertension affects 10 15% of all pregnancies.
The associated risk of later CVD is lower than for preeclampsia but is

�
still elevated (RR 1.7 2.5). [193][,][314][,][316][,][317] Also, the risk for sustained or
future hypertension is elevated (RRs vary, from 2.0 to 7.2 or even
higher). [187][,][318] Again, however, there was incomplete adjustment for
conventional risk factors. The risk of developing DM is also elevated

�
in these women (RR 1.6 2.0). [314][,][319] Both preterm (RR 1.6) and stillbirth (RR 1.5) have been associated with a moderate increase in risk


Finally, gestational DM confers a sharply elevated risk of future
DM, with up to 50% of affected women developing DM within 5
years after pregnancy, and an up to two-fold increased risk of CVD in
the future. [188][,][320] Screening by fasting glucose or HbA1c may be preferable to oral glucose tolerance testing. [191][,][321]

3.4.12.2 Non-obstetric conditions

Polycystic ovary syndrome affects 5% of all women in their fertile
years. [322][,][323] It has been associated with an increased risk of CVD. [314]

The risk of developing hypertension is probably increased, but data
are conflicting. [324] Polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with a

�
higher risk of developing DM (RR 2 4), [189][,][190] suggesting that periodic screening for DM is appropriate.

Premature menopause occurs in roughly 1% of women <_40 years
of age. Up to 10% of women experience an early menopause, defined
as that occurring by 45 years of age. [314][,][325] Early menopause is associated with an increased risk of CVD (RR 1.5). [326][�][328] A linear inverse
relationship between earlier menopause and CHD risk has been
found, whereby each 1-year decrease in age at menopause portended a 2% increased risk of CHD. [329]

3.4.12.3 Erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction (ED), defined as the consistent inability to reach
and maintain an erection satisfactory for sexual activity, has a multi
factorial cause. It affects almost 40% and more than 50% of men over
40 years and 60 years of age, respectively. [330][,][331] Men with ED have
an increased risk of all-cause mortality [odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% CI
1.01�1.57] and CVD mortality (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.00�2.05). ED
and CVD share common risk factors (hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and DM, smoking, obesity, metabolic syndrome, sedentary lifestyle, and depression) and a common
pathophysiological basis of aetiology and progression. [332][,][333]

Medication used to prevent CVD, such as aldosterone receptor
antagonists, some beta-blockers, and thiazide diuretics, can cause
ED. [330][,][332][�][335] ED is associated with subclinical vascular disease, [336] and

precedes CAD, stroke, and PAD by a period that usually ranges from 2

�
to 5 years (average 3 years). Men with ED have a 44 59% higher risk

for total CV events, 62% for AMI, 39% for stroke, and 24�33% for allcause mortality, with a higher risk in those with severe ED. [337][�][341]

There is strong evidence that CVD risk assessment is needed in men
presenting with ED. [336][,][342] In men with ED and low-to-intermediate
CVD risk, detailed risk profiling by, for example, CAC score is suggested, but so far not supported by evidence. [338][,][341] Assessment of ED
severity and physical examination should be part of the first-line CVD
risk assessment in men. [333][,][341] Lifestyle changes are effective in improving
sexual function in men: these include vigorous physical exercise, [334][,][343]

improved nutrition, weight control, and smoking cessation. [343][�][345]
### 4. Risk factors and interventions at the individual level

4.1. Treatment recommendations:
classes, grades, and freedom of choice
Clear communication about risks and benefits is crucial before any

treatment is initiated. Risk communication is discussed in section 3.2.4,


Further, the capacity of these patients to adaptively use the healthcare systems is impaired due to their mental condition (e.g. not being
able to trust other people and seek help, impaired capacity to be
adherent). [100] Barriers on the part of healthcare providers are stigmatizing attitudes, insufficient mental health literacy, and lack of confidence in mental healthcare. [307][�][309] Although patients with mental
disorders have an increased CVD risk, they receive a lower rate of
recognition and treatment of traditional ASCVD risk factors. [310]

Preliminary evidence suggests that taking mental disorders into
account improves classical CVD risk models. [311][,][312]

Certain categories of patients with learning difficulties and associated disorders (such as Down’s syndrome) are at increased risk of
CVD disease, but perhaps not specifically ASCVD. However, health
inequalities and the prevalence of CV risk factors may be greater in
these populations, although epidemiology research is scarce.

an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. NAFLD represents accumulation of ectopic fat; persons with NAFLD are often
overweight or obese, and not uncommonly have abnormal BP, glucose, and lipid levels. A recent study investigating whether NAFLD
increases CV risk beyond traditional risk factors [313] shows that after

and benefits of individual treatment are the topic of this section. In all

scenarios where recommendations for individual interventions to

reduce risk are ‘strong’ (class I or IIa), it is important to realize that
many patients who have received appropriate risk information often
(in up to 50% of cases, some studies suggest) consciously opt to
forego the proposed intervention. This applies not only to lifestyle
measures, but also to drug interventions. Apparently, what professio
nals feel is sufficient risk reduction for a reasonable effort or initiation

of a drug with few side-effects does not always correspond to
patients’ views. The reverse is also true: not only may some patients
at (very) high risk forego interventions, some patients with low-tomoderate risk may be highly motivated to decrease their risk even
further. Hence, treatment recommendations are never ‘imperative’
for (very) high risk patients, nor are interventions ever ‘prohibited’
for patients at low-to-moderate risk. There is evidence that a higher
proportion of women, compared to men, have a low awareness of
their CVD risk and the need for therapeutic interventions. This warrants efforts to improve awareness, risk assessment, and treatment in
women. [52][,][346][�][351]

management
4.2.1. Goals of clinicianpatient communication
Clinicians should provide a personalized presentation of guidelines to
improve understanding, encourage lifestyle changes, and support
adherence to drug therapy. Applying this in daily practice faces different barriers. [352] Patients’ ability to adopt a healthy lifestyle depends
on cognitive and emotional factors, the impact of a diagnosis or symp
toms, socioeconomic factors, educational level, and mental health.

Perceived susceptibility to illness and the anticipated severity of the
consequences are also prominent components of patients’
motivation. [353]


about consequences and side-effects, intellectual/cognitive abilities,
mental disorders, physical limitations, financial aspects, and living
alone. [360][,][362][�][364] Importantly, only substantial risk reduction motivates patients for preventive drug treatment, which obviates the
need for appropriate risk communication. [365][,][366] Depression is
another important factor, and adequate treatment thereof improves
adherence. [367][,][368]

Mobile phone applications may improve adherence to both medication and behavioural changes. [369] Their use is easy and probably
cost-effective. [370]

4.2.4. Treatment goals
In the subsequent sections, different domains of individual treatment
are discussed. Table 6 summarizes the treatment goals and some key
interventions for different categories of patients. For additional information on risk categories and the principle of a stepwise approach to
treatment targets, please refer to section 3.2.3.1. For details on treatment goals, how to achieve them, strengths of recommendations and

Recommendations for physical activity


|Recommendations|Classa|Levelb|ESC 2021|

PA reduces the risk of many adverse health outcomes and risk factors
in all ages and both sexes. There is an inverse relationship between
moderate-to-vigorous PA and all-cause mortality, CV morbidity and


4.2.2. How to improve motivation?
Communication strategies such as motivational interviewing are useful. [354] Consultation sessions may include a family member or friend,
especially for elderly patients. Connection is paramount: focus before
greeting; listen intently; agree on what matters most; connect with the
person’s story; and explore emotions. [355] The OARS (Open-ended
questions, Affirmation, Reflective listening, and Summarizing) principle
helps patients to present their perceptions, and clinicians to summarize. The SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timely)
principle may help with setting goals for behavioural change. [353][,][356]

Healthcare professionals must consider capability, opportunity (physical, social, or environmental) and motivation for behavioural
change. [357] Multidisciplinary behavioural approaches that combine the
knowledge and skills of different caregivers are recommended. [358]

4.2.3. Optimizing drug adherence
Medication adherence ranges from 50% for primary ASCVD prevention to 66% for secondary prevention. [359] Physicians should consider
non-adherence in every patient and inquire non-judgmentally about
it. [360] Approximately 9% of cases of ASCVD in Europe can be attributed to poor medication adherence. [361] Contributors to nonadherence include polypharmacy, complexity of drug/dose regimes,
poor doctor-patient relationship, lack of disease acceptance, beliefs

mortality, as well as incidence of type 2 DM. [371][�][373][,][383][�][387] The
reduction in risk continues across the full range of PA volumes, and
the slope of risk decline is steepest for the least active individuals. [371][�][374][,][386][,][387] More information on PA prescription can be found
in a recent ESC Guideline. [388]

4.3.1.1 Physical activity prescription
PA should be individually assessed and prescribed in terms of frequency, intensity, time (duration), type, and progression. [389]

Recommendations regarding pre-participation screening can be
found in previous ESC Guidelines. [388] Interventions shown to increase
PA level or reduce sedentary behaviour include behaviour theorybased interventions, such as goal-setting, re-evaluation of goals, selfmonitoring, and feedback. [372][,][380][,][381] Using a wearable activity tracker
may help increase PA. [382] Most important is to encourage activity that
people enjoy and/or can include in their daily routines, as such activities are more likely to be sustainable.

4.3.1.2 Aerobic physical activity
Examples of aerobic PA include walking, jogging, cycling, etc. [389]

Adults are recommended to perform at least 150�300 min a week

�
of moderate-intensity PA, or 75 150 min of vigorous-intensity PA,
or an equivalent combination of both, spread throughout the
week. [371][,][372] Additional benefits are gained with even more PA.
Practising PA should still be encouraged in individuals unable to meet
the minimum. In sedentary individuals, a gradual increase in activity

level is recommended. When older adults or individuals with chronic

conditions cannot achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity PA a week,
they should be as active as their abilities and conditions
allow. [371][�][375][,][384][,][385] PA accumulated in bouts of even <10 min is

they should be as active as their abilities and conditions
allow. [371][�][375][,][384][,][385] PA accumulated in bouts of even <10 min is
associated with favourable outcomes, including mortality. [371][,][390]

PA can be expressed in absolute or relative terms. [389] Absolute
intensity is the amount of energy expended per minute of activity,
assessed by oxygen uptake per unit of time (mL/min or L/min) or by
metabolic equivalent of task (MET). A compendium of the energy
cost in MET values for various activities is available. [391] An absolute

measure does not consider individual factors such as body weight,
sex, and fitness level. [389]


Relative intensity is determined based on an individual’s maximum
(peak) effort, e.g. percentage of cardiorespiratory fitness (%VO 2
max), percentage of maximum (peak) heart rate (%HR max ) or using
rating of perceived exertion according to the Borg scale. Less fit individuals generally require a higher level of effort than fitter people to
perform the same activity. A relative intensity measure is necessary
to provide an individualized PA prescription. [389]

Classification for both absolute and relative intensity and examples
are presented in Table 7.

4.3.1.3 Resistance exercise

Resistance exercise in addition to aerobic PA is associated with lower
risks of total CV events and all-cause mortality. [378][,][379][,][393][�][395] The sug
�
gested prescription is one to three sets of 8 12 repetitions at the

�
intensity of 60 80% of the individual’s 1 repetition maximum at a frequency of at least 2 days a week in a variety of 8�10 different exercises
involving each major muscle group. For older adults or deconditioned

�
individuals, it is suggested to start with one set of 10 15 repetitions at
40�50% of 1 repetition maximum. [389] In addition, older adults are recommended to perform multicomponent PA that combines aerobic,
muscle-strengthening, and balance exercises to prevent falls. [372]

4.3.1.4 Sedentary behaviour
Sedentary time is associated with greater risk for several major
chronic diseases and mortality. [371][,][372][,][375][�][377][,][396][�][399] For physically
inactive adults, light-intensity PA, even as little as 15 minutes a day, is
likely to produce benefits. There is mixed evidence to suggest how
activity bouts that interrupt sedentary behaviour are associated with
health outcomes. [375][,][398][,][400]

MUFA = monounsaturated fatty acid; PUFA = polyunsaturated fatty acid.

The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) trial showed
a dose�response relation between sodium reduction and BP
reduction. [423] In a meta-analysis, salt reduction of 2.5 g/day resulted in
a 20% reduction of ASCVD events (RR 0.80). [410] A U- or J-shaped
relation between a low salt intake and ASCVD is debated. [424]

Underlying illness and malnutrition may explain both low food and
salt intakes as well as increased ASCVD. [410][,][425][,][426] The totality of evidence warrants salt reduction to prevent CHD and stroke.

In most Western countries, salt intake is high (�9�10 g/day),
whereas the recommended maximum intake is 5 g/day. Optimal
intake might be as low as �3 g/day. Salt reduction can be achieved by
dietary choices (fewer processed foods) and the reformulation of
foods by lowering their salt content (see section 5.2.2).
Potassium (e.g. in fruits and vegetables) has favourable effects on
BP and risk of stroke (RR 0.76). [427]

As for vitamins, observational studies have found inverse associa
tions between vitamins A and E and risk of ASCVD. However, inter
vention trials have failed to confirm these findings. Also, trials of
supplementation with B vitamins (B6, folic acid, and B12), and vitamins C and D have not shown beneficial effects. [428][,][429]

4.3.2.3 Fibre

Each 7 g/day higher intake of total fibre is associated with a 9% lower
risk of CAD (RR 0.91). [430] A 10 g/day higher fibre intake was associated with a 16% lower risk of stroke (RR 0.84) and a 6% lower risk of
type 2 DM (RR 0.94). [431][,][432] A high fibre intake may reduce postprandial glucose responses after carbohydrate-rich meals and also lower
triglyceride levels. [433]

Dietary habits influence CV risk, mainly through risk factors such as
lipids, BP, body weight, and DM. [401][,][402] Table 8 summarizes the characteristics of a healthy diet. Although recommendations about
nutrients and foods remain important for CV health, there is a growing concern about environmental sustainability, supporting a shift
from an animal- to a more plant-based food pattern. [411][,][412]

4.3.2.1 Fatty acids
Risk of CHD is reduced when dietary saturated fats are replaced
appropriately (Figure 10). This is also the case when replacing meat
and dairy foods. [406][,][407] Polyunsaturated fats (-25%), monounsaturated
fats (-15%), and to a lesser extent carbohydrates from whole grains
(-9%), were all associated with reduced CHD risk when isocalorically
substituted for dietary saturated fat. [408][,][409]

Reducing saturated fatty acid intake to less than 10% of energy
may have additional benefits. [405] However, the LDL-C-lowering effect
of substituting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for saturated fatty
acids may be less in obese (5.3%) than in normal-weight persons
(9.7%). [421]

Trans fatty acids, formed during industrial processing of fats, have
unfavourable effects on total cholesterol (increase) and HDL-C
(decrease). On average, a 2% increase in energy intake from trans
fatty acids is associated with a 23% higher CHD risk. [422] A regulation
of the European Union (EU) Commission has set the upper limit to 2
g per 100 g of fat (April 2019) (https://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/labelling_nutrition/trans-fat-food_en).

When guidelines to lower saturated fat intake are followed, reductions in dietary cholesterol intake follow.

4.3.2.2 Minerals and vitamins

A reduction in sodium intake may reduce SBP by, on average, 5.8
mmHg in hypertensive, and 1.9 mmHg in normotensive patients. [410]

(equivalent to 77 g) and vegetables (equivalent to 80 g) per day, while
all-cause mortality was not reduced further with intakes of more
than five servings. [434] A meta-analysis reported an 11% lower risk for
stroke associated with three to five daily servings of fruits and vegetables and of 26% with five servings a day compared with fewer than
three servings. [435][,][436] A single portion of pulses (legumes) a day lowers LDL-C by 0.2 mmol/L and is associated with a lower risk of
CHD. [437][,][438]

4.3.2.4.2. Nuts. A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies suggested that daily consumption of 30 g of (mixed) nuts was associated
with a �30% lower risk of ASCVD. [437] Both pulses and nuts contain
fibre and other bioactive components. [438]

4.3.2.4.3. Meat. From both a health and an environmental point of
view, a lower consumption of meat, especially processed meat, is recommended. [411] A restriction of red meat may have little or no effect
on major cardiometabolic outcomes. [416] However, substituting red
meat with high-quality plant foods (i.e. nuts, soy, and legumes) does
improve LDL-C concentrations. [406] A recent analysis showed that
higher intake of processed meat and unprocessed red meat is associated with a 7% and 3%, respectively, increased risk of ASCVD. [417]

By reducing processed meats, salt intake will also be reduced. The
World Cancer Research Fund recommends limiting red meat con

sumption to 350 500 g per week. [439]

4.3.2.4.4. Fish and fish oil supplements. Studies indicate that eating
fish, particularly fish rich in n-3 PUFA, at least once a week, is associated with a 16% lower risk of CAD, [418] and eating fish two to four
times a week is associated with a 6% lower risk of stroke. [440] The

highest risk was observed in the range of no or very low intakes.

times a week is associated with a 6% lower risk of stroke. [440] The

highest risk was observed in the range of no or very low intakes.

Several meta-analyses and a recent Cochrane review showed no
benefits of fish oils on CV outcomes and/or mortality, [441][�][443]


although a 7% lower risk of CHD events was observed. A meta-analysis of 13 RCTs included the results of VITAL (Vitamin D and
Omega-3 Trial), ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in
Diabetes), and REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events

�
with Icosapent Ethyl Intervention Trial). [444] In the analysis excluding
REDUCE-IT, fish oil reduced total ASCVD (RR 0.97) and CHD death
(RR 0.92). [444] Including REDUCE-IT (a study done in participants with
high triglycerides, comparing very high icosapent ethyl doses vs. mineral oil placebo) strengthened the results. [444] However, this is the
only study that tested a high icosapent ethyl dose and questions have
been raised regarding the choice of placebo. Very recently,
STRENGTH (Long-Term Outcomes Study to Assess Statin Residual
Risk with Epanova in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with
Hypertriglyceridemia) failed to demonstrate benefit of a combined
eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid preparation. [445]

4.3.2.4.5. Alcoholic beverages. The upper safe limit of drinking alcoholic beverages is about 100 g of pure alcohol per week. How this
translates into number of drinks depends on portion size, the standards of which differ per country, mostly between 8 and 14 g per
drink. This limit is similar for men and women. [413] Drinking above this
limit lowers life expectancy.

Results from epidemiological studies have suggested that, whereas
higher alcohol consumption is roughly linearly associated with a
higher risk of all stroke subtypes, coronary disease, HF, and several
less common CVD subtypes, it appeared approximately log-linearly
associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction. [413] Moreover,
Mendelian randomization studies do not support the apparently protective effects of moderate amounts vs. no alcohol against ASCVD,
suggesting that the lowest risks for CVD outcomes are in abstainers
and that any amount of alcohol uniformly increases BP and
BMI. [414][,][415] These data challenge the concept that moderate alcohol
consumption is universally associated with lower CVD risk.

3272 ESC Guidelines


4.3.2.4.6. Soft drinks and sugar. Regular consumption of sugarsweetened beverages (i.e. two servings per day compared with one
serving per month) was associated with a 35% higher risk of CAD in
women in the Nurses’ Health Study, whereas artificially sweetened
beverages were not associated with CAD. In the EPIC (European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) cohort, both artificially and sugar-sweetened soft drinks were associated with all-cause
mortality, while only the former was associated with circulatory diseases. [419] The WHO guideline recommends a maximum intake of 10%
of energy from free sugars (mono- and disaccharides), which includes
added sugars as well as sugars present in fruit juices. [420]

4.3.2.4.7. Coffee. Non-filtered coffee contains LDL-C-raising cafestol
and kahweol, and may be associated with an up to 25% increased risk
of ASCVD mortality by consumption of nine or more drinks a day. [446]

Non-filtered coffee includes boiled, Greek, and Turkish coffee and

�
some espresso coffees. Moderate coffee consumption (3 4 cups
per day) is probably not harmful, perhaps even moderately
beneficial. [447]

4.3.2.4.8. Functional foods. Functional foods containing phytosterols
(plant sterols and stanols) are effective in lowering LDL-C levels by
an average of 10% when consumed in amounts of 2 g/day. [448] The

effect is in addition to that obtained with a low-fat diet or use of sta
tins. No studies with clinical endpoints have been performed yet.

Red yeast rice supplements are not recommended and may even
cause side-effects. [449]

4.3.2.4.9. Dietary patterns. Studying the impact of a total dietary pattern shows the full preventive potential of diet. The Mediterranean
diet includes high intakes of fruits, vegetables, pulses, wholegrain
products, fish, and olive oil, moderate consumption of alcohol, and
low consumption of (red) meat, dairy products, and saturated fatty

acids. Greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with a

10% reduction in CV incidence or mortality and an 8% reduction in
all-cause mortality. [403] Following a Mediterranean diet enriched with
nuts over a 5-year period, compared with a control diet, lowered the
risk of ASCVD by 28% and by 31% with a diet enriched with extravirgin olive oil. [404]

Also, a shift from a more animal-based to a plant-based food pattern may reduce ASCVD. [411]

b Level of evidence.

4.3.3.1 Treatment goals and modalities
Although diet, exercise, and behaviour modification are the main
therapies for overweight and obesity, they are often unsuccessful in
the long term. Yet, maintaining even a moderate weight loss of
5- 10% from baseline has salutary effects on risk factors including BP,
lipids, and glycaemic control, [450][,][451] as well as on premature all-cause
mortality. [456] Weight loss is associated with lower morbidity but
higher mortality in (biologically) older adults (the ‘obesity paradox’).
In this group, emphasis should be less on weight loss and more on
maintaining muscle mass and good nutrition.

4.3.3.2 Diets for weight loss
Energy restriction is the cornerstone of management. PA is essential
to maintain weight loss and prevent rebound weight gain, but is not
reviewed here. Hypocaloric diets may be categorized as:

1. Diets that aim to reduce ASCVD, including plant-based [457][,][458] and
hypocaloric Mediterranean diets, [458][,][459] with modifications to suit

local food availability and preferences.

2. Changes to the fat and carbohydrate macronutrient composition of

the diet, including low or very low carbohydrate diets (with

50�130 g and 20�49 g carbohydrates/day, respectively), moderate

�
carbohydrate diets (>130 225 g carbohydrates/day), and low-fat

diets (<30% of energy from fat).

3. High-protein diets to preserve lean muscle mass and enhance

satiety.

4. Diets focusing on specific food groups (e.g. increasing fruit and vege
tables or avoiding refined sugars).

5. Diets that restrict energy intake for specified time periods, for

example on 2 days a week or alternate days (intermittent fasting) or

during certain hours of the day (time-restricted eating).

These diets give broadly similar short-term weight loss. [452][�][454] By
12 months, the effects tend to diminish. [453] Benefits of the

Mediterranean diet, however, tend to persist. The quality of nutrients
in a diet, for example substituting unsaturated for saturated fats (see
section 4.3.2.1) and including fibre-rich carbohydrates [460] determines
whether a diet is healthy in the long term.

Low or very low carbohydrate diets may have advantages regarding appetite control, lowering triglycerides, and reducing medications
for type 2 DM. [461] Such diets may be ketogenic and need medical or
at least dietetic supervision. Studies beyond 2 years are scarce.
Extreme carbohydrate intakes should be avoided in the long term
and plant substitutions of fat and protein for carbohydrates are
advantageous over animal ones. [462]

Intermittent fasting diets produce equivalent weight loss to continuous energy restriction when matched for energy intake. [463]

Medications approved in Europe as aids to weight loss (orlistat,
naltrexone/bupropion, high-dose liraglutide) may supplement
lifestyle change to achieve weight loss and maintenance, although

fatal and non-fatal first recurrent ASCVD events [hazard ratio (HR

(Stockholm Women’s Intervention Trial for Coronary Heart
Disease), the intervention yielded a substantial reduction in all-cause
mortality (OR 0.33). [468] A recent RCT reported that cardiac rehabilitation (CR) enhanced by stress management produced significant
reductions in ASCVD events compared with standard CR alone (HR
0.49). [469] Concerning psychopharmacotherapy of patients with CHD
and depression, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment lowers rates of CHD readmission (risk ratio 0.63) and all-cause
mortality (risk ratio 0.56). [470] A recent RCT reported that, in patients
with ACS and depression, treatment with the SSRI, escitalopram,
resulted in a lower rate of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI) (HR 0.69). [471] Collaborative care for patients with CHD and
depression has small beneficial effects on depression, but significantly
reduces short-term major cardiac events. [485]

Concerning side-effects of psychopharmacological treatments,
many psychiatric drugs are associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. [486] In patients with HF, antidepressants are associated with increased risk of cardiac and all-cause mortality (HR 1.27;

Treatment of an unhealthy lifestyle will reduce CVD risk as well as
improve mental health. Smoking cessation, for instance, has a positive
effect on depression outcomes, [474][,][475] as do exercise therapy [113][,][476]

and healthy dietary practices. [477] Evidence-based interventions for
smoking cessation, and improving PA and diet, are considered useful
and applicable for persons with mental disorders. [465][,][478][�][480]

Mental disorders are associated with an increased risk of CVD and

a worse prognosis in patients with ASCVD, due to CVD events or
other death causes, including suicide. [100][,][113][,][305] Mental-health treatments effectively reduce stress symptoms and improve quality of life.

Several observational studies indicate that treatment or remission of
depression reduces CVD risk. [113][,][481][�][484] Psychological interventions
in patients with CHD may reduce cardiac mortality (RR 0.79) and
alleviate psychological symptoms. [466] Psychotherapy focusing on
stress management in ASCVD patients improves CVD outcomes. In

4.5.1. Smoking cessation
Stopping smoking is potentially the most effective of all preventive
measures, with substantial reductions in (repeat) myocardial infarctions or death. [487][,][488] Lifetime gains in CVD-free years are substantial
at all ages, and benefits are obviously even more substantial if other
complications from smoking would be accounted for. From age 45
years, gains of 3 - 5 years persist in men to age 65 and in women to
age 75 years (Figure 11). Even in heavy smokers (>_20 cigarettes/day),
cessation lowers CVD risk within 5 years, although it remains elevated beyond 5 years. Total health benefits will be even larger
because of gain in non-CVD health.

factors: age, sex, systolic blood pressure, and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The model is currently validated for low- and moderate-risk countries. CVD = cardiovascular disease; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HR = hazard ratio; LIFE-CVD

from myocardial infarction or stroke’ gained from smoking cessation. The lifetime benefit is calculated by estimating lifetime CVD risk with the LIFE-CVD
model [76] multiplied by the HR compared to sustained smoking (0.60) from a meta-analysis of studies on the CVD risk of smoking [496] and multiplied by the
HR (0.73) for non-CVD competing mortality. [497] For individualized estimations of lifetime benefit, this table can be used or the electronic version of LIFECVD, assessable via the ESC CVD risk app or https://u-prevent.com/.

Table 9 ‘Very brief advice’ for smoking cessation

|‘Very brief advice’ on smoking is a proven 30-second clinical intervention,<br>developed in the UK, which identifies smokers, advises them on the best<br>method of quitting, and supports subsequent quit attempts. There are<br>three elements to very brief advice:|ESC 2021|
|---|---|
|• ASK - establishing and recording smoking status|• ASK - establishing and recording smoking status|
|• ADVISE - advising on the best ways of stopping|• ADVISE - advising on the best ways of stopping|
|• ACT - offering help|• ACT - offering help|



UK = United Kingdom.

Quitting must be encouraged in all smokers, and passive smoking
should be avoided as much as possible. Very brief advice may be
advantageous when time is limited (Table 9). A major impetus for cessation occurs at the time of diagnosis or treatment of CVD.
Prompting a person to try to quit, brief reiteration of CV and other
benefits of quitting, and agreeing on a specific plan with a follow-up
arrangement are evidence-based interventions.
Smokers who quit may expect an average weight gain of 5 kg, but
the health benefits of tobacco cessation outweigh risks from weight
gain. [495] Persistent or reuptake of smoking is common in patients with
CHD, in particular in those with severe depression and environmental exposures. [498] Mood-management therapies may improve outcomes in patients with current or past depression. [499]

4.5.2. Evidence-based drug interventions
Drug support for stopping smoking should be considered in all smokers
who are ready to undertake this action. Evidence-based drug interventions include nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, varenicline, and cytisine (not widely available). [489][�][491] All forms of NRT
(chewing gum, transdermal nicotine patches, nasal spray, inhaler, sublingual tablets) are effective. Combination vs. single-form NRT and 4 mg
vs. 2 mg gum can increase success. [492] NRT shows no adverse effects in
patients with ASCVD, [493] but evidence of efficacy in this group is inconclusive. [494] In patients with ASCVD, varenicline (RR 2.6), bupropion (RR
1.4), telephone therapy (RR 1.5), and individual counselling (RR 1.6) all
increase success rates. [494] The antidepressant, bupropion, aids longterm smoking cessation with similar efficacy to NRT. [490]

Varenicline 1 mg b.i.d. (twice a day) increases quitting rates more
than two-fold compared with placebo. [491] The RR for abstinence vs.
NRT was 1.25 and vs. bupropion, 1.4. Lower or variable doses are
also effective and reduce side-effects. Varenicline beyond the 12week standard regimen is well tolerated. Varenicline initiated in hospital following ACS is efficacious and safe. [500]

The main side-effect of varenicline is nausea, but this usually subsides. A causal link between varenicline and neuropsychiatric adverse
events is unlikely. [501] Varenicline, bupropion, and NRT do not
increase serious CV adverse event risks during or after treatment. [502]

Cytisine is effective for smoking cessation, but evidence to date is
limited. [491]

4.5.2.1 Electronic cigarettes
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) simulate combustible cigarettes
by heating nicotine and other chemicals into a vapour. E-cigarettes





deliver nicotine without most of the tobacco chemicals, and are

probably less harmful than tobacco.
Recent evidence suggests that e-cigarettes are probably more
effective than NRT in terms of smoking cessation. [503][�][505] The longterm effects of e-cigarettes on CV and pulmonary health, however,
require more research. [506] Dual use with cigarettes should be
avoided. Furthermore, as e-cigarettes are addictive, their use should
be subject to similar marketing controls as standard cigarettes, especially the flavoured varieties that appeal to children. [507] Despite being
lower in toxicants than regular cigarettes, ‘heat-not-burn’ cigarettes
do contain tobacco and should be discouraged.

4.6. Lipids
This section covers recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of unfavourable blood lipid levels. More detail and guidance for
complex cases/tertiary care, including genetic lipid disorders, are
available in the 2019 ESC/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS)
Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias. [3]

Recent evidence has confirmed that the key initiating event in atherogenesis is the retention of LDL and other cholesterol-rich lipoproteins within the arterial wall. The causal role of LDL-C, and other apoB-containing lipoproteins, in the development of ASCVD is demonstrated beyond any doubt by genetic, observational, and interventional studies. [20] Meta-analysis of clinical trials has indicated that the
relative reduction in CVD risk is proportional to the absolute reduction of LDL-C, irrespective of the drug(s) used to achieve such
change, with no evidence of a lower limit for LDL-C values or ‘J-curve’
effect. [21] The absolute benefit of lowering LDL-C depends on the

absolute risk of ASCVD and the absolute reduction in LDL-C, so

even a small absolute reduction in LDL-C may translate to significant
absolute risk reduction in a high- or very-high-risk patient. [22] A recent
LDL-C target-driven RCT in patients after ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) demonstrated a target LDL-C level of <1.8
mmol/L (70 mg/dL) with the use of statin and, if required, ezetimibe,
was associated with a lower CVD risk than those who had a target
range of 2.3�2.8 mmol/L (90�110 mg/dL). [508] Studies on the clinical
safety of (very) low achieved LDL-C values have not caused particular
concerns, although monitoring for longer periods is required.

4.6.1. Measurement of lipids and lipoproteins
4.6.1.1 Fasting vs. non-fasting measurements
Non-fasting sampling of lipid parameters is recommended for general
risk screening, since it has the same prognostic value as fasting samples. [509][,][510] In patients with metabolic syndrome, DM, or hypertriglyceridaemia, calculated LDL-C from non-fasting samples should be
interpreted with care.

HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein

cholesterol.

3276 ESC Guidelines


4.6.1.2 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement
LDL-C can be measured directly, but in most studies and many laboratories, LDL-C is calculated using the Friedewald formula:

 - [In mmol/L: LDL-C = total cholesterol][ �] [HDL-C][ �] [(0.45][ �] [trigly-]

cerides)

 - [In mg/dL: LDL-C = total cholesterol][ �] [HDL-C][ �] [(0.2][ �] [trigly-]

cerides)

The calculation is only valid when the concentration of triglycerides is <4.5 mmol/L (�400 mg/dL), and not precise when LDL-C is
very low [<1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL)]. In patients with low LDL-C levels and/or hypertriglyceridaemia (<_800 mg/dL), alternative formulae
are available [511][,][512] or LDL-C can be measured directly.

4.6.1.3 Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
The non-HDL-C value is calculated by subtracting HDL-C from total
cholesterol. Non-HDL-C, unlike LDL-C, does not require the triglyceride concentration to be <4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/dL). It also has an
advantage in that it is accurate in a non-fasting setting, and may be
more accurate in patients with DM. There is evidence for a role
of non-HDL-C as a treatment target as it captures the information
regarding all apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins. [513] We suggest
it as a reasonable alternative treatment goal for all patients, particularly
for those with hypertriglyceridaemia or DM. How non-HDL-C levels
correspond to commonly used LDL-C goals is shown in Table 10.

4.6.1.4 Apolipoprotein B
Apolipoprotein B provides a direct estimate of the total concentration of atherogenic lipid particles, particularly in patients with elevated triglycerides. However, on average, the information conferred
by apolipoprotein B is similar to that of calculated LDL-C. [514]

How apolipoprotein B levels correspond to commonly used LDL-C
goals is shown in Table 10.

LDL-C goals are summarized in the recommendations below. As not
all drugs are tolerated or available/affordable, treatment should focus
on achieving LDL-C levels as close as possible to the given goals.
Treatment should be a shared decision-making process between




- [In mmol/L: LDL-C = total cholesterol][ �] [HDL-C][ �] [(0.45][ �] [trigly-]

cerides)

- [In mg/dL: LDL-C = total cholesterol][ �] [HDL-C][ �] [(0.2][ �] [trigly-]

cerides)


As explained earlier in these guidelines (section 3.2.3.1), we propose
a stepwise approach to treatment goals, also for LDL-C (Figures 6�8).
This approach may seem novel but, in reality, resembles clinical practice, where treatment intensification is considered based on anticipated
benefit, side-effects, and—importantly—patient preferences. The ultimate lipid goals are the same as in the 2019 ESC/EAS dyslipidaemia
Guidelines. [3] Evidence from glucose-lowering treatment studies indicates that stepwise treatment does not compromise goal attainment,
and is associated with fewer side-effects and higher patient satisfaction. [66][,][67] In specific cases (at very high risk), the physician may opt to
merge both steps and proceed directly to the low LDL-C target level
of STEP 2. In apparently healthy people, lifetime treatment benefit of
LDL-C reduction may play a role in shared decision-making, together
with risk modifiers, comorbidities, patient preference, and frailty. Figure
12 may support decision-making, as it shows the estimated lifetime
benefits in years-free-of-CVD in relation to the total CVD risk profile,

calibrated in low-to-moderate CVD risk countries.

After STEP 1, treatment intensification with STEP 2 must be con
sidered in all patients. Given that lower is better, we encourage liberal
intensification of treatment, particularly if submaximal doses of (lowcost) generic statins are used and side-effects are not apparent.
The treatment goal of LDL-C <1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) in STEP 2,
in patients with established ASCVD or without ASCVD but at very
high risk, is lower than the lowest LDL-C goal of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/
dL) in the 2016 ESC prevention Guidelines. [2] This low goal was established based on data from recent Mendelian randomization studies, [80]

meta-analyses from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’
Collaboration, [21] RCTs such as IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of
Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), [515] and—more
recently—proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
inhibitor clinical outcome studies. [516][�][518] The class and level of evi
dence supporting this LDL-C target of <1.4 mmol/L (55 mg/dL) for
patients with ASCVD is identical to that in the recent ESC/EAS dyslipidaemia guidelines. [3] For primary prevention in very-high-risk
patients, however, the class of recommendation is lower (Class I in
the dyslipidaemia guidelines, Class IIa in the current guidelines),
because the Task Force was less unanimous with regards to this low
LDL-C target in the primary prevention context.
For patients with ASCVD who experience a second vascular event
within 2 years (not necessarily of the same type as the first) while taking maximum tolerated statin-based therapy, an even lower LDL-C
goal of <1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) may be considered. Importantly,

there are no differences in the RR reductions between men and

women and between younger and older patients (at least up to age
75 years), or between those with and without DM. [3]

4.6.2.2 Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants
There are no treatment goals for triglycerides, but <1.7 mmol/L (150
mg/dL) is considered to indicate lower risk, whereas higher levels

indicate a need to look for other risk factors.

4.6.2.3 High-density lipoprotein cholesterol
To date, no specific goals for HDL-C levels have been determined in
clinical trials, although low HDL-C is associated with (residual) risk in
ASCVD patients. PA and other lifestyle factors, rather than drug
treatment, remain important means of increasing HDL-C levels.


The calculation is only valid when the concentration of triglycerides is <4.5 mmol/L (�400 mg/dL), and not precise when LDL-C is
very low [<1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL)]. In patients with low LDL-C levels and/or hypertriglyceridaemia (<_800 mg/dL), alternative formulae
are available [511][,][512] or LDL-C can be measured directly.


4.6.1.3 Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
The non-HDL-C value is calculated by subtracting HDL-C from total
cholesterol. Non-HDL-C, unlike LDL-C, does not require the triglyceride concentration to be <4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/dL). It also has an
advantage in that it is accurate in a non-fasting setting, and may be
more accurate in patients with DM. There is evidence for a role
of non-HDL-C as a treatment target as it captures the information
regarding all apolipoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins. [513] We suggest
it as a reasonable alternative treatment goal for all patients, particularly
for those with hypertriglyceridaemia or DM. How non-HDL-C levels
correspond to commonly used LDL-C goals is shown in Table 10.


4.6.1.4 Apolipoprotein B
Apolipoprotein B provides a direct estimate of the total concentration of atherogenic lipid particles, particularly in patients with elevated triglycerides. However, on average, the information conferred
by apolipoprotein B is similar to that of calculated LDL-C. [514]

How apolipoprotein B levels correspond to commonly used LDL-C
goals is shown in Table 10.

disease may improve hyperlipidaemia without requiring lipidlowering therapy. This is particularly true for hypothyroidism.
Secondary dyslipidaemias can also be caused by alcohol abuse, DM,
Cushing’s syndrome, diseases of the liver and kidneys, as well as by
in all patients with higher than optimal lipid levels.

approved in several European countries. Results from the ASCVD
outcomes trial are expected for 2023.
The expected LDL-C reductions in response to therapy are
shown in Figure 13, and may vary widely among individuals.
Therefore, monitoring the effect on LDL-C levels is recommended,
with assessment of LDL-C levels 4 - 6 weeks after any treatment
strategy initiation or change.


4.6.3.1 Strategies to control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol

4.6.3.1.1. Diet and lifestyle modifications. Dietary factors influence
the development of ASCVD, either directly or through their action
on traditional risk factors, such as plasma lipids, BP, or glucose levels.
Consistent evidence from epidemiological studies indicates that
higher consumption of fruit, non-starchy vegetables, nuts, legumes,
fish, vegetable oils, yoghurt, and wholegrains, along with a lower
intake of red and processed meats, foods higher in refined carbohydrates, and salt, is associated with a lower incidence of CV events. [519]

Moreover, the replacement of animal fats, including dairy fat, with
vegetable sources of fats and PUFAs may decrease the risk of
ASCVD. [407] More detail on lifestyle recommendations can be found

earlier in this section.

4.6.3.1.2. Drugs for treatment of dyslipidaemias. The currently
available lipid-lowering drugs include inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (statins), fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.g. ezetimibe),
and—more recently—PCSK9 inhibitors. Bempedoic acid, an oral
cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, has recently been approved in several
countries. Usage is mainly intended in combination with ezetimibe in
patients with statin intolerance. ASCVD outcome trials are not
expected before the end of 2022. Additionally, inclisiran, a new small
interfering ribonucleic acid, has shown to reduce LDL-C by 50�55%
when applied subcutaneously twice a year. These results were
obtained either on top of statin or without other lipid-lowering
therapies, and with almost no side-effects. Inclisiran has been

pharmacological therapy for concomitant conditions. In practice,
management of a patient with myalgia but without a major increase in
creatine kinase is based on trial and error, and usually involves switching to a different statin or use of a very low dosage several days a
week, with a gradual increase in frequency and dosage. A management algorithm may help to manage these patients. [3]

4.6.3.1.4. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe). The combination of statin with ezetimibe brings a benefit that is in line with
meta-analyses showing that LDL-C reduction has benefits independent of the approach used. [3][,][21] The beneficial effect of ezetimibe is also
supported by genetic studies. [528] Together, these data support the
position that ezetimibe should be considered as second-line therapy,
either on top of statins when the therapeutic goal is not achieved, or
when a statin cannot be prescribed.

4.6.3.1.5. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors.
PCSK9 inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9) decrease LDL-C
by up to 60%, either as monotherapy or in addition to the maximum
tolerated dose of statin and/or other lipid-lowering therapies, such as
ezetimibe. Their efficacy appears to be largely independent of background therapy. In combination with high-intensity or maximum tolerated statins, alirocumab and evolocumab reduced LDL-C by 46�73%
more than placebo, and by 30% more than ezetimibe. [516][,][517] Among
patients in whom statins cannot be prescribed, PCSK9 inhibition

reduced LDL-C levels when administered in combination with ezetimibe. [529] Both alirocumab and evolocumab effectively lower LDL-C
levels in patients who are at high or very high CVD risk, including those
with DM, with a large reduction in future ASCVD events. [516][,][517]

PCSK9 inhibitors also lower triglycerides, raise HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I, and lower lipoprotein(a), although the relative contributions of these lipid modifications remain unknown. PCSK9 inhibitors
are costly, and their cost-effectiveness, long-term safety, and effect in
primary prevention are as yet unknown. We recommend considering
cost-effectiveness in a loco-regional context before implementing rec
ommendations that involve their use. Recommendations for the use of

PCSK9 inhibitors are described in the Recommendations for pharmacological LDL-C lowering. Inclisiran is a long-acting hepatic PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor that also lowers LDL-C levels considerably. [530] Its effect

on clinical outcomes remains to be established.

4.6.3.2 Strategies to control plasma triglycerides
Although CVD risk is increased when fasting triglycerides are >1.7
mmol/L (150 mg/dL), [531] the use of drugs to lower triglyceride levels
may only be considered in high-risk patients when triglycerides are
>2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) and triglycerides cannot be lowered by lifestyle measures. The available pharmacological interventions include
statins, fibrates, PCSK9 inhibitors, and n-3 PUFAs (in particular icosapent ethyl in doses of 2�4 g/day; see section 4.3.2.4.4).

Recommendations for the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia are

shown in the Recommendations below.

4.6.3.2.1. Fibrates. Fibrates are used primarily for triglyceride lowering and, occasionally, for increasing HDL-C. Evidence supporting the
use of these drugs for CVD event reduction is limited, and given the
strong evidence favouring statins, routine use of these drugs in CVD
prevention is not recommended. [3] To prevent pancreatitis, when

4.6.3.1.3. Statins. Statins decrease LDL-C, thereby reducing ASCVD
morbidity and mortality as well as the need for coronary artery interventions. Statins also lower triglycerides, and may reduce pancreatitis
risk. Therefore, they are the drug of first choice in patients at
increased risk of ASCVD. [3]

4.6.3.1.3.1. Adverse effects, interactions, and adherence to statin

therapy
The most frequent adverse effect of statin therapy is myopathy, but
this is rare. A meta-analysis ruled out any contribution to an increase
in non-CV mortality. [522] Increased blood sugar and HbA1c levels (i.e.
increased risk of type 2 DM) can occur after treatment initiation and
are dose dependent, in part linked to slight weight gain, but the benefits of statins outweigh the risks for the majority of patients. [527]

Adhering to lifestyle changes when prescribed a statin should lessen
the risk of DM. Increased levels of liver enzymes may occur during
statin therapy, and are usually reversible. Routine monitoring of liver
enzyme values is not indicated.

�
Although 5 10% of patients receiving statins complain of myalgia,
in most cases it is not attributable to statins. [3] The risk of myopathy
(severe muscular symptoms) can be minimized by identifying vulnerable patients and/or by avoiding statin interactions with specific drugs.
Rhabdomyolysis is extremely rare. As statins are prescribed on a
long-term basis, possible interactions with other drugs deserve particular and continuous attention, as many patients will receive

triglycerides are >10 mmol/L (900 mg/dL), they must be reduced not
only by drugs, but also by restriction of alcohol, treatment of DM,
withdrawal of oestrogen therapy, etc. In patients with severe primary
hypertriglyceridaemia, referral to a specialist must be considered.

An evidence-based approach to the use of lipid-lowering nutraceuticals could improve the quality of the treatment, including therapy adherence, and achievement of the LDL-C goal in clinical
practice. However, it has to be clearly stressed that there are still no
outcome studies proving that nutraceuticals can prevent CVD morbidity or mortality. [532]

4.6.4. Important groups


Recommendations for drug treatments of patients with
hypertriglyceridaemia.







Recent evidence has strengthened the role of LDL-C as an ASCVD
risk factor in older patients. [537] Evidence from trials indicates that statins
and other lipid-lowering drugs produce significant reductions in major
vascular events irrespective of age. [538][,][539] However, there is less direct

evidence of statin benefit in those without evidence of ASCVD. Under

the age of 70 years, statins are recommended for primary prevention
depending on the level of risk. Above that age, initiation of statin treatment for primary prevention may be considered when at (very) high
risk, but we explicitly recommend also taking other arguments into
account, such as risk modifiers, frailty, estimated life-time benefit,
comorbidities, and patient preferences (see section 3.2.3.3 and Figure
12). In case of renal function impairment or risk for drug interactions,
the statin dose should be up-titrated carefully. In terms of LDL-C targets, there is insufficient evidence to support targets for primary prevention in older patients. Although the conventional LDL-C target of
<2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) may seem reasonable, the results of ongoing
primary prevention trials in older patients must be awaited [STAREE
(STAtin Therapy for Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial; clinicatrials.
gov registration: NCT02099123]. Frailty, polypharmacy, and muscle
symptoms remain relevant factors to consider in older patients.

4.6.4.1 Women

The proportional reductions per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C in
major vascular events, major coronary events, coronary revasculari
zation, and stroke are similar in women and men. In addition, the rela
tive effects of non-statin drugs that lower LDL-C (ezetimibe and
PCSK9 inhibitors, on top of high-intensity statin therapy) are also similar in both women and men. [3]

4.6.4.2 Older patients (�70 years)
Compared to the 2019 ESC/EAS dyslipidaemia guidelines, [3] we provide a single cut-off for identifying ‘older persons’ as those >_70 years
of age, as opposed to 75 years, for reasons of consistency with other
parts of the current guidelines. As a result, class and level of evidence
have been modified in some age groups, in particular the category of
patients between 70 and 75 years. Although a single age cut-off is
now used, it is important to stress that all such age cut-offs are relatively arbitrary, and biological age influences this threshold in clinical
practice. For example, a very fit 75-year-old person may qualify for a
treatment normally reserved for those <70 and, conversely, a very
frail 65-year-old person should sometimes be considered ‘older’.
General recommendations for lipid-lowering treatment in older
patients are summarized below.

Lowering of LDL-C in patients with DM is consistently associated
with lower CVD risk. Similar to prevention in apparently healthy
individuals, we propose a stepwise approach to lipid control,
dependent on risk, estimated lifetime benefit, comorbidities, and
patient preferences (Figure 8). PCSK9 inhibitors can also be used in
patients with DM not reaching their LDL-C targets with statins and/

or ezetimibe.

4.6.4.5 Familial Hypercholesterolaemia
Patients who could have genetic dyslipidaemias, such as heterozygous
FH, can be identified by extreme lipid abnormalities and/or family history (Table 11). An LDL-C >4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) in therapynaı¨ve patients requires careful evaluation for possible FH. However,
in the presence of premature ASCVD or family history, possible FH
should be considered at lower LDL-C levels. Besides genetic testing
(not always affordable), use of the Dutch Clinical Lipid Network criteria (Table 11) is recommended to identify possible FH.
Homozygous FH is rare and should always be placed under the care
of lipid experts.

ezetimibe (which allows larger LDL-C reductions without increasing
the statin dose) has a beneficial effect on ASCVD outcomes in
CKD. [543] For patients with end-stage renal disease, however, we recommend that hypolipidaemic therapy should not be initiated (see

4.7.2.2 Unattended automated office blood pressure measurement
Repeated automated office BP readings may improve the reproducibility of BP measurement. If the patient is seated alone and unobserved, unattended automated office BP measurement may reduce

or eliminate the ‘white-coat’ effect, and unattended automated office

BP measurements are usually lower than conventional office BP
measurements, and more similar to ambulatory daytime BP or home

outcomes than office BP, and identifies ‘white-coat’ hypertension and
masked hypertension (see below). Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension are lower with ABPM than office BP (Table 12). [4]

4.7.2.4 Home blood pressure monitoring
Home BP is the average of all BP readings performed with a validated
semiautomatic monitor, for at least 3 consecutive days (ideally 6 - 7
days), with readings in the morning and evening, taken seated in a
quiet room after 5 min of rest. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension are lower than those for office
BP (Table 12). Patient self-monitoring may have a beneficial effect on
medication adherence and BP control. [4]

Clinical indications for ambulatory or home monitoring are shown

in Table 15.

4.7.3 Screening and diagnosis of hypertension
Ideally, all adults should be screened for the presence of hypertension, [578][,][579] but most countries lack the required resources and infrastructure. Formally, these guidelines recommend opportunistic
screening at least in susceptible individuals, such as those who are
overweight or have a family history of hypertension (see section 3.1).

When hypertension is suspected, the diagnosis of hypertension
should be confirmed, either by repeated office BP measurements
over a number of visits, or by 24-h ABPM or HBPM (Figure 14).

4.7.3.1 White-coat and masked hypertension
White-coat hypertension refers to BP that is elevated in the office
but is normal when measured by ABPM or HBPM. It occurs in up to
30�40% of patients. The risk associated with white-coat hypertension is lower than sustained hypertension but may be higher than
normotension. People with white-coat hypertension should receive
lifestyle advice to reduce their CV risk and be offered BP measurement at least every 2 years by ABPM or HBPM because of high rates
of transition to sustained hypertension. Routine drug treatment for
white-coat hypertension is not indicated.
Masked hypertension refers to patients with a normal office BP but
an elevated BP on ABPM or HBPM. These patients often have
HMOD and are at a CV risk level at least equivalent to sustained
hypertension. It is more common in younger people and in those with
high-normal office BP. In masked hypertension, lifestyle changes are
recommended, and drug treatment should be considered to control
‘out-of-office’ BP, with periodic monitoring of BP, usually with HBPM.

4.7.4. Clinical evaluation and risk stratification in

hypertensive patients
The routine work-up for hypertensive patients is shown in Table 16.
Alongside clinical examination, this is designed to:

Adapted from [4]

reduction in SBP is at least moderate to high [Figure 15 (lifetime benefit calibrated in low-to-moderate CVD risk countries]. Also, the presence of HMOD mandates treatment of grade 1 hypertension. For
grade 2 hypertension or higher (SBP >160 mmHg), treatment is recommended, because not only is the lifetime benefit of reducing BP
almost universally high in such patients, there is also the importance
of reducing the risk of HMOD resulting in other morbidities such as
renal disease, haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease, and HF.

4.7.5.3 Blood pressure treatment targets
When drug treatment is used, the aim is to control BP to target
within 3 months. Evidence now suggests that the BP targets in the
previous iteration of this guideline [2] were too conservative, especially
for older patients. In line with the stepwise approach (section 3.2.3.1),
it is now recommended that the first step in all treated patients
should achieve a treated SBP <140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP)
<80 mmHg. [552][,][554] The recommended ultimate SBP treatment target

� �
range for younger patients (18 69 years) is 120 130 mmHg,
although some patients may safely achieve lower treated SBP levels
than this and, if they are well tolerated, there is no need to backtitrate treatment. [552][,][554][�][556] The ultimate target SBP for patients aged
>_70 years is <140 mmHg and down to 130 mmHg if tolerated. [552][,][554][,][557][,][580] This change in the BP target range for older people
compared with the 2016 ESC prevention guidelines [2] is supported by
evidence that these treatment targets are safely achieved in many
older patients and are associated with significant reductions in the
risk of major stroke, HF, and CV death. [557][,][580] It also takes into
account that the even lower SBP in the intensively treated group in
SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) (mean 124
mmHg) probably reflects a conventional office SBP range of
130�139 mmHg. [555] It is recognized, however, that the evidence supporting more strict targets is less strong for very old people (>80
years) and those who are frail. Also, in these older and especially frail

cocaine), drugs that may increase BP (e.g. cyclosporine, sympaticomimetics), liquorice, etc. More detail on work-up of suspected
secondary hypertension is provided elsewhere. [4]

Echocardiography is recommended in patients with ECG abnor
malities, and should be considered when the result will influence clini
cal decision-making. Fundoscopy is recommended in grade 2 or 3
hypertension and in all patients with DM. The routine measurement
of other biomarkers and use of vascular imaging are not
recommended. [548][�][551]

4.7.5. Treatment of hypertension
The treatment of hypertension involves lifestyle interventions for all
patients and drug therapy for most patients.

4.7.5.1 Lifestyle interventions to lower blood pressure and/or reduce car
diovascular risk

Lifestyle interventions are indicated for all patients with high-normal
BP or hypertension because they can delay the need for drug treatment or complement the BP-lowering effect of drug treatment.
Moreover, most lifestyle interventions have health benefits beyond
their effect on BP. Lifestyle is discussed extensively in section 4.3.

4.7.5.2 Initiation of drug treatment
Drug treatment decisions in CVD prevention are mostly based on

absolute CVD risk, risk modifiers, comorbidities, estimated benefit of

treatment, frailty, and patient preferences. The same is true for
hypertension. Drug treatment of grade 1 hypertension (SBP
140 - 159 mmHg) has level A evidence for reducing CVD risk. In
younger patients, however, the absolute 10-year CVD risk is often

low, and lifetime benefit of treatment should be considered and com
municated before instituting treatment (Figure 6 and section 3.2.3.6).
In many such cases, the absolute lifetime benefit per 10-mmHg

sex, current smoking, systolic blood pressure, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The model is currently validated for low- and moderate-risk countries. The lifetime benefit is expressed as ‘years of median life expectancy free from myocardial infarction or stroke’ gained from 10 mmHg SBP lowering.
The lifetime benefit is calculated by estimating lifetime CVD risk with the LIFE-CVD model multiplied by the HR (0.80) from a meta-analysis of the effect of
BP lowering. For 20 mmHg SBP lowering, the average effect is almost twice as large, etc. For individualized estimations of lifetime benefit, this table can be

patients, it may be difficult to achieve the recommended target BP
range due to poor tolerability or adverse effects, and high-quality
measurement and monitoring for tolerability and adverse effects is
especially important in these groups. [580]

Compared to previous ESC/ESH Hypertension Guidelines, [4] we
changed the cut-off for identifying who is ’older’ from 65 to 70 years
for reasons of consistency with other parts of the current guidelines.
Although a single age cut-off is provided, it is important to stress that


example, a very fit 75-year-old person may qualify for a treatment
policy normally reserved for those <70 and, vice versa, a very frail
65-year-old person should sometimes be considered ‘older’.

BP targets for patient subgroups with various comorbidities are

shown in Table 18.

4.7.5.3.1. Blood pressure targets according to ambulatory and
home blood pressure monitoring. There are no outcome-based trials that have used ABPM or HBPM to guide treatment. Therefore,

3288 ESC Guidelines


ABPM and HBPM BP targets are extrapolated from observational
data. A treated office SBP of 130 mmHg likely corresponds to a 24-h
SBP of 125 mmHg and home SBP <130 mmHg. [4]

4.7.5.4 Drug treatment of hypertension
The most important driver of benefit is the magnitude of BP lowering.
Single-drug therapy will rarely achieve optimal BP control.

Initial therapy with a combination of two drugs should be
considered usual care for hypertension. [560][�][563][,][565][,][581] The only
exceptions would be patients with a baseline BP close to the recommended target, who might achieve that target with a single drug, or
very old (>80 years) or frail patients who may better tolerate a more
gentle reduction of BP. Initial combination therapy, even low-dose
combination therapy, is more effective at lowering BP than monotherapy, [560][,][561][,][565] and will reduce BP faster and reduce heterogeneity
in response. [560][,][565] Moreover, initial combination therapy does not
increase risk of adverse effects. [560][�][563][,][565] Initiating therapy with two
drugs will also help overcome treatment inertia where patients
remain on one drug long term despite inadequate BP control. [562]

Single-pill strategy to treat hypertension: poor adherence to
BP-lowering medication is a major cause of poor BP control rates,
and is directly related to the number of pills. [581] Single-pill combination therapy (if available) is the preferred strategy. This strategy will
control BP in most patients. [560][�][565]

Recommended drug therapy and treatment algorithm: five
major classes of BP-lowering drug therapy have shown benefit in
reducing CV events; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. [582] A recommended treatment algorithm based on best available evidence,


CKD and eGFR <45 mL/min/m [2] and blood potassium levels >4.5
mmol/L. [555][,][572] Potassium-binding drugs reduce the risk of hyperkalaemia. [573] When spironolactone is not tolerated, amiloride, alphablockers, beta-blockers, or centrally acting drugs, such as clonidine,
have evidence supporting their use. [555][,][572][,][574] Renal denervation and
device-based therapy may be considered for specific cases, and are
discussed in the 2018 ESC/ESH hypertension guidelines. [4]

4.7.7. Management of hypertension in women
The diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in women is similar to
that in men, except for women of child-bearing potential or during
pregnancy, because of potential adverse effects of some drugs on the
foetus, especially in the first trimester. In addition, the effect of oral
contraceptive pills on the risk of developing or worsening hypertension should be considered. [4]

4.7.8. Duration of treatment and follow-up
Treatment of hypertension is usually maintained indefinitely because
cessation of treatment usually results in a return of BP to pretreatment levels. In some patients with successful lifestyle changes, it may
be possible to gradually reduce the dose or number of drugs. After

BP is stable and controlled, visits should be scheduled at least annu
ally, and include the control of other risk factors, renal function, and
HMOD, as well as reinforce lifestyle advice. When there is a loss of
BP control in a previously well-controlled patient, non-compliance
with therapy should be considered. Self-measurement of BP using
HBPM helps engage the patient in their own management and can
improve BP control. HBPM is essential to monitor BP control in
patients with a significant ‘white-coat effect’ or masked hypertension.
Supervision of patient follow-up increasingly involves nurses and
pharmacists and is likely to become increasingly supported by telemedicine and app-based technologies.

4.7.5.4 Drug treatment of hypertension
The most important driver of benefit is the magnitude of BP lowering.
Single-drug therapy will rarely achieve optimal BP control.

pragmatic considerations (e.g. combination pill availability), and pathophysiological reasoning is shown in Figure 16. [4] A combination of an

ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic is

the preferred initial therapy for most patients with hypertension. [566][�][569] For those in whom treatment requires escalation to
three drugs, a combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a CCB
and a thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic should be used. [563][,][570][,][571] Beta
blockers should be used when there is a specific indication (e.g.
angina, post myocardial infarction, arrythmia, HFrEF, or as an alternative to an ACE inhibitor or ARB in women of child-bearing potential). [582] Combinations of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB are not

recommended because of no added benefit on outcomes and
increased risk of harm. [575][,][576]

Specific modifications to the treatment algorithm are recommended for patients with CHD, CKD, HF, and AF. [4]

4.7.6. Resistant hypertension
Resistant hypertension is defined as BP being uncontrolled despite
treatment with optimal or best-tolerated doses of three or more
drugs including a diuretic, and confirmed by ABPM or HBPM. The
prevalence of resistant hypertension is likely to be <10% of treated
hypertensive patients. Spironolactone is the most effective drug for
lowering BP in resistant hypertension when added to existing treatment; however, the risk of hyperkalaemia is increased in patients with

4.8.1.1 Lifestyle intervention
Lifestyle management is a first priority for ASCVD prevention and
management of DM. Most persons with DM are obese, so weight
control is crucial. Several dietary patterns can be adopted, where the
predominance of fruits, vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and low-fat
protein sources is more important than the precise proportions of
total energy provided by the major macronutrients. Salt intake should
be restricted. Specific recommendations include limiting saturated
and trans fats and alcohol intake, monitoring carbohydrate consumption, and increasing dietary fibre. A Mediterranean-type diet, where
fat sources are derived primarily from monounsaturated oils, is protective against ASCVD. More detail is provided in section 4.3.2.

4.8.1. Key risk factor concepts and newer paradigms
Except for glucose management, prevention of ASCVD follows the
same principles as for people without type 2 DM. Achieving BP and
LDL-C targets is particularly important. More recently, trial evidence
has shown that drugs in the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2
(SGLT2) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1RA) classes lower ASCVD, HF, and renal risks independently of
baseline HbA1c and whether patients are on metformin. Such benefits are most evident in those with existing ASCVD, HF, or CKD, but
appear to extend to groups at elevated risk. This has led to newer
treatment algorithms.

4.8.1.1 Lifestyle intervention
Lifestyle management is a first priority for ASCVD prevention and
management of DM. Most persons with DM are obese, so weight
control is crucial. Several dietary patterns can be adopted, where the
predominance of fruits, vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and low-fat
protein sources is more important than the precise proportions of
total energy provided by the major macronutrients. Salt intake should
be restricted. Specific recommendations include limiting saturated
and trans fats and alcohol intake, monitoring carbohydrate consumption, and increasing dietary fibre. A Mediterranean-type diet, where
fat sources are derived primarily from monounsaturated oils, is protective against ASCVD. More detail is provided in section 4.3.2.
A combination of aerobic and resistance exercise training is effective in preventing the progression of type 2 DM and for the control
of glycaemia. Smokers should be offered cessation support (see section 4.5). Lifestyle intervention lowers future microvascular and macrovascular risks as well as mortality in the longer term. [603] Intensive
lifestyle changes with low-calorie diets and mean weight losses in the
region of 10 kg leads to remission of type 2 DM in around 46% of
cases at 1 year and 36% by 2 years. [585] In those with prediabetes,
other ASCVD risk factors should be assessed both before (to incentivize improvements) and after lifestyle changes have taken place. [604]

4.8.1.2 Glycaemic control
The UKPDS [587] established the importance of intensive glucose lowering with respect to CVD risk reduction in persons newly diagnosed
with DM, with better evidence to support metformin, which correctly remains the first agent of choice for the majority of patients
diagnosed with DM. Three trials were conducted to see if CV events
could be reduced further with more intensive glycaemia treatment. [559][,][588][,][593] However, there were unexpected increases in total
and ASCVD deaths in the ACCORD (Action to Control
Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial [559] and a similar trend in VADT
(Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial). [593] The results prompted concerns
about pursuing tight glucose control, particularly in older people with
DM and in those with existing ASCVD. Subsequent meta-analyses of

relevant trials showed reductions in non-fatal AMI and CAD events,
but no effect on stroke or total mortality. [605][,][606] The meta-analyses
suggested that CVD benefits for an average HbA1c reduction of 0.9%
over 5 years were less than via treatment of cholesterol and BP.
HbA1c targets should be personalized to individual characteristics

There was, however, an increase in the rate of hospitalization for HF
with saxagliptin in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of

Vascular Outcomes Recorded in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus
Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) trial. [608]

4.8.1.3 Newer diabetes mellitus drug classes: cardiovascular disease
benefits
Recent trials from two classes of drugs (SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1RAs) have shown CVD benefits that appear independent of
glycaemic control and, where examined, of baseline metformin
use. [596][,][597][,][611] Their results have recently been systematically meta[analysed (Supplementary Figures 1 �](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data) [4).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data) [590][,][591]

For SGLT2 inhibitors, three trials demonstrated the CV benefits of
empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin. [611][�][613] Major adverse
CV events (MACE) were reduced modestly, by 14%, with no clear
effect on stroke and an unclear effect on myocardial infarction. [590]

However, reductions in incident HF hospitalization/CVD death by
24% and renal endpoints by 44% were seen. [590] The MACE benefits
were evident only in those with baseline ASCVD, but HF and renal
benefits appeared to extend to those with type 2 DM with multiple
risk factors. However, a more recent trial in people with type 2 DM
and ASCVD showed ertugliflozin to be non-inferior to placebo with
respect to MACE outcomes. [614] Whether the results represent a

class effect is, therefore, not clear. Four further SGLT2 inhibitor trials
demonstrated the benefit of canagliflozin [598] and dapagliflozin [599] in
patients with CKD [with DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention
of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease) showing similar
benefits in people without DM], and dapagliflozin [600] and empagliflozin [601] in patients with HFrEF, with both trials showing similar benefits
in those without type 2 DM.

The specific pattern of trial results (e.g. early separation of curves
for HF hospitalization) suggests that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors
may relate more to cardiorenal haemodynamic effects than to atherosclerosis. [600] Other than genitourinary infections, rates of adverse
events (including diabetic ketoacidosis) were generally low. One trial
showed an excess of amputations and fractures, [612] but none of the

other trials noted imbalances. Patients should be advised on the

importance of genitourinary hygiene before being prescribed these

medications.

GLP-1RAs reduce MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality by



(EASD) consensus report, [592] recommend that metformin should be
used as first-line treatment, while the ESC Guidelines [5] recommended

in 2019 that SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs may be used without
metformin in people with DM and CVD or at high risk of CVD, as
reviewed. [602] A subset of the writing groups of the ADA/EASD consensus report and the ESC Guidelines [616] was convened as an expert
panel. The expert panel emphasized the overall commonalities of
approach and the need to ensure that people with type 2 DM, CVD,
HF, or CKD are treated appropriately with an SGLT2 inhibitor or
GLP-1RA. The panel concluded that this approach should be initiated
independent of background therapy, glycaemic control, or individualized treatment goals. [616] The view of the ESC is that metformin
should be considered, but is not mandatory first-line treatment in
patients with ASCVD or evidence of TOD. Certainly, the initiation of
metformin in such patients should not forego or delay the initiation
of evidence-based SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1RAs. A risk score plus
cost-effective analyses would be useful to determine which patients
free from ASCVD or evidence of TOD may be recommended for
these newer drugs. In all the above, there is no evidence of any sex
interaction in benefits. Finally, people with type 2 DM should be
involved in decision-making after explanation of the potential benefits
and side-effects of the drugs.

4.8.2. Type 1 diabetes mellitus
The DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) established
the importance of tight glucose control to lessen the risks of both

microvascular and macrovascular disease in both men and women
with type 1 DM. [617] A 27-year follow-up of this trial showed that 6.5
years of intensive DM therapy was associated with a modestly lower
all-cause mortality rate. [617] A glycaemic target for HbA1c of
6.5�7.5% (48�58 mmol/mol) appears to be a balanced approach
for long-term care.

Recently, metformin was shown not to lower progression of carotid IMT in persons with type 1 DM considered to be at elevated CVD
risk. [618] Its use is not recommended in type 1 DM for this indication.
SGLT2 inhibitors improve metabolic control in type 1 DM and may
complement insulin therapy in selected patients.

4.8.1.3 Newer diabetes mellitus drug classes: cardiovascular disease

Recent trials from two classes of drugs (SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1RAs) have shown CVD benefits that appear independent of

[596][,][597][,][611] Their results have recently been systematically meta[analysed (Supplementary Figures 1 �](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data) [4).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data) [590][,][591]

demonstrated the benefit of canagliflozin [598] and dapagliflozin [599] in
patients with CKD [with DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin and Prevention

benefits in people without DM], and dapagliflozin [600] and empagliflozin [601] in patients with HFrEF, with both trials showing similar benefits
in those without type 2 DM.

showed an excess of amputations and fractures, [612] but none of the

other trials noted imbalances. Patients should be advised on the

importance of genitourinary hygiene before being prescribed these

medications.

GLP-1RAs reduce MACE, CV death, and all-cause mortality by
around 12%, with around a 9% reduction in myocardial infarction and
a 16% reduction in stroke. [591] Furthermore, HF is lowered by 9% and
a composite renal outcome was lowered by 17%. The results cannot
be explained by lowering of glucose levels and, in multiple SGLT2
inhibitor and GLP-1RA trials, subgroup analyses suggested that these
benefits could be independent of metformin use. [594][�][597] Most trials
were conducted in patients with existing ASCVD or, in the REWIND
(Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in
Diabetes) trial, with a significant proportion of patients at high risk for
CVD. [615] Side-effects of this class mainly include nausea and vomiting,
which can lessen with gradual up-titration. Risks of hypoglycaemia
can be reduced by lowering doses of sulphonylureas or insulin.

The largely positive results of these two classes of drugs (SGLT2
inhibitors and GLP-1RAs) have led to rapid changes in DM algorithms, but with some differences in interpretation. [602] Most DM

Acknowledging that the process of atherosclerosis has inflammatory components has led to the investigation of various antiinflammatory therapies in recent years. The first study to examine
the effects of reducing inflammation without impacting lipid levels
was CANTOS (Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis
Outcome Study), in which the monoclonal antibody, canakinumab, provided proof-of-concept for anti-inflammatory therapy in
high-risk patients. [636] This particular drug was, however, not further developed for this indication because of the risk of fatal infections and high costs. Methotrexate was the second antiinflammatory drug studied for this purpose, but was not proven
effective in reducing CVD outcomes. [637]

In 2019, COLCOT (Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial)
reported a significant reduction (HR 0.77) in CVD outcomes with
low-dose colchicine [0.5 mg o.d. (once a day)] in patients with a
recent AMI. The more recent LoDoCo2 (second low-dose colchicine) trial reinforced these results in patients with chronic CAD (HR
0.69). [85] This study observed a trend towards increased non-CV mortality, which requires further attention.

The use of colchicine in daily practice remains to be established
based on further clinical study data and experiences in daily practice.
Nonetheless, the encouraging results justify consideration of lowdose colchicine in selected, high-risk patients.

4.9.1. Antithrombotic therapy in individuals without

atherosclerotic disease

In 2009, a meta-analysis in patients with low CVD risk reported a
12% reduction in ASCVD with aspirin but a significant increase in
major bleeding. [619] CVD risk reduction and bleeding risks were similar
in men and women. [631] More contemporary primary prevention trials
reported no or little benefit in patients without ASCVD and a consistent increase in bleeding. [624][,][626][,][627] An updated meta-analysis did not
show a reduction in all-cause or CV mortality with aspirin, but did
show a lower risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.82) and
ischaemic stroke (RR 0.87). [628] Conversely, aspirin was associated
with a higher risk of major bleeding (RR 1.50), intracranial bleeding
(RR 1.32), and major gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 1.52), with no difference in the risk of fatal bleeding (RR 1.09). Bleeding risks were particularly increased in older persons. Other recent meta-analyses
found very similar results. [629][,][630] Overall, although aspirin should
not be given routinely to patients without established ASCVD, we
cannot exclude that in some patients at high or very high CVD
risk, the benefits outweigh the risks. [632][,][633] In patients with DM
and no evident ASCVD, the ASCEND study reported a 12% risk
reduction and a significant increase in major bleeding, but not in
fatal or intracranial bleeding. [624] A meta-analysis of aspirin for
primary prevention in DM found a number needed to treat of
95 to prevent one major adverse ischaemic event in 5 years. [625]

Hence, as in patients without DM, aspirin may be considered if
CVD risk is exceptionally high. Only one in four patients in the
ASCEND study were being treated with a proton pump inhibitor.
Wider use than this could potentially amplify the benefit of aspirin
in primary prevention for patients at higher atherosclerotic risk.

In apparently healthy persons <70 years of age with (very) high

CVD risk, further studies are needed. Until then, decisions in these

high-risk persons should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking both
ischaemic risk and bleeding risk into consideration.

4.9.2. Antithrombotic therapy in individuals with

established atherosclerotic disease

In established atherosclerotic disease, aspirin is associated with significant reductions in serious vascular events, including stroke and coronary events, and a 10% reduction in total mortality. [619] These benefits
outweigh the bleeding hazards.

In patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or
LEAD, clopidogrel showed a slight superiority for ischaemic
events with respect to aspirin, with a similar safety profile. [620]





Subgroup analysis suggested a greater benefit of clopidogrel in
patients with LEAD. A meta-analysis showed a clinically modest
risk reduction with P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy (number needed
to treat: 244), and no effect on all-cause or vascular mortality and
major bleeding. [621] More guidance on antithrombotic treatment in
the specific settings of CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and LEAD,
including possible indications for dual pathway inhibition in
patients with LEAD, is given in section 6.

4.9.3. Proton pump inhibitors
Proton pump inhibitors reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in
patients treated with antiplatelet drugs and may be a useful adjunctive
therapy to improve safety. [634][,][635] Proton pump inhibitors that specifically inhibit CYP2C19 (omeprazole or esomeprazole) may reduce
the pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel. Although this interac
tion has not been shown to affect the risk of ischaemic events, coad
ministration of omeprazole or esomeprazole with clopidogrel is not
recommended. [622]

CR is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary intervention not just including exercise training and PA counselling, but also education, risk factor modification, diet/nutritional counselling, and vocational and
psychosocial support. [358] Prevention and rehabilitation programmes
after ASCVD events or revascularization reduce CV hospitalizations,
myocardial infarction, CV mortality and, in some programmes, allcause mortality. [638][,][640][�][642] They may also reduce depressive/anxiety
symptoms. [649] In patients with chronic HF (mainly HFrEF), exercisebased cardiac rehabilitation (EBCR) may improve all-cause mortality,
reduce hospital admissions, and improve exercise capacity and quality
of life. [639][,][650] CR is generally cost-effective. [651]

Clinical trials and registries are highly heterogeneous, which influences national guidelines, legislation, and reimbursement. [652][,][653] The
results of recent reviews provide clinicians with minimal requirements for successful CR after ACS or coronary artery bypass graft:


Recently, the European Association of Preventive Cardiology
(EAPC) proposed minimal and optimal standards for improvement
of secondary prevention through CR programmes in Europe. [657]

Although exercise training prescription should adopt the FITT (frequency, intensity, time duration, and type of exercise) model, interclinician variance and disagreement exists. [658] To optimize exercise
training, the EAPC has introduced a digital, interactive decision support tool; the EXPERT (EXercise Prescription in Everyday practice &
Rehabilitation Training) Tool (https://www.escardio.org/Education/
Practice-Tools/CVD-prevention-toolbox/expert-tool). [659] No single
exercise component is a significant predictor of mortality; only adherence to the full intervention improves outcome. [660]

Despite proven benefits, rates of referral, participation, and implementation are low. [653][,][660][,][661] Uptake seems lower in women, but a
variety of other intrapersonal, interpersonal, clinical, logistical, health
system, and CR programme-related factors affect participation and
adherence. [662] CR enrolment is higher if trained nurses or allied
healthcare providers intervene face-to-face, whereas adherence may
be higher when remote interventions are implemented (i.e. homebased). [643] Nurse-coordinated programmes can increase
effectiveness. [644][�][646] Home-based CR with or without telemonitor
ing may increase participation and appear similarly effective as
centre-based CR. [647] Telehealth interventions are more effective than
no intervention, [648] but may also complement conventional CR. Also,
mobile device-based healthcare (mHealth) delivery through smartphones may be as effective as traditional centre-based CR, showing
significant improvements in health-related quality of life. [663] These
novel interventions may support the patient to maintain long-term
healthy behaviours after specialized CR programmes. [664]

prevention of cardiovascular disease
Population level approaches to CVD prevention centre around
upstream measures requiring broad public-health interventions targeting lifestyle and promoting monitoring of CVD. These measures
are designed to address populations and are intended to shift the
population attributable risk. This is based on a prevention paradox
described by Geoffrey Rose in 1981. [665] The population attributable
risk depends on the RR and on the prevalence of a risk factor in the
general population. If the prevalence of a significant RR factor is low,
then the population attributable risk may be modest. Conversely, if a
low-impact RR factor is common, the population attributable risk
may be high. This prevention approach following the Geoffrey Rose
paradigm [665][,][666] states that small shifts in the risk of disease across a
whole population consistently lead to greater reductions in disease
burden than does a large shift in high-risk individuals only. [667][,][668] In
other words, many people exposed to a small risk may generate
more disease than a few exposed to a conspicuous risk. This
population-wide approach—as opposed to strategies targeting highrisk individuals—has major advantages at the population level whilst
sometimes having only a modest benefit at the individual level,
because it addresses the CV health of a large number of individuals
over the entire life course. It should be noted that high-risk and
population-level prevention strategies are not mutually exclusive and

must therefore coexist.

Prevalence of high-risk conditions and incidence rates of CVD vary
across countries. Many of their underlying causes are known, and
they are closely related to dietary habits, PA, smoking, alcohol,
employment, social deprivation, and the environment. The objective
of population approaches to prevention of CVD is to control the
underlying determinants of CV health and, in this way, reduce population incidence rates. The population approach may bring numerous
benefits, such as narrowing the gap in health inequalities, preventing
other conditions such as cancer, pulmonary diseases, and type 2 DM,
and saving costs from the avoided CV events and early retirement
due to health problems.

Individual behaviour is enacted in an environment with hierarchical

levels, which encompass individual choice, family influence, cultural and
ethnic grouping, workplace, healthcare, and policy at the regional, state
and global levels (e.g. EU policies and international trade agreements).
The aim of this section of the guidelines is to provide evidence-based
suggestions for the most effective interventions to reduce CVD risk at
the population level, improve CVD health, and promote healthy
choices at the community, regional, and global level. Health challenges
cannot be solved by the healthcare systems alone and require political
support. To advance this cause, the WHO has been organizing Global
Conferences on Health promotion since 1990.

5.2. Specific risk factor interventions at
the population level
Population-level interventions aim to alter the societal environment,
modify certain social determinants of health, and provide incentives
to encourage changes in individual behaviour and exposure to risk factors. Social determinants of health include socioeconomic status (education, occupation, and income), wealth inequalities, neighbourhood


professionals play an important role in advocating evidence-based
population-level interventions. By modifying the general context, one
can induce healthy decisions as a default in entire populations (all age
groups and particularly vulnerable ones). The task for both national
and local authorities is to create social environments that provide
healthier defaults, taking health literacy into account. [669][,][670] The evidence presented here builds on recent comprehensive reviews and
individual studies, noting that it is rarely feasible to use an RCT to evaluate population-level interventions (in contrast to individual-level
interventions). [671][,][672] The importance of heart disease in women has
become apparent and sex differences in CVD prevention have
prompted sex-specific awareness campaigns with the aim of reducing
sex disparities in research and clinical care. While interpreting this
section, it is important to recognize that there are often vested interests, which may influence policy decisions on health promotion.

[The supplementary material for this section presents evidence for](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab484#supplementary-data)
population-level strategies dealing with specific risk factor interventions for PA (section 5.2.1), diet (section 5.2.2), smoking and tobacco
use (section 5.2.3), and alcohol consumption (section 5.2.4). Lifestyle
changes at the population level take time, may be expensive, and
need to be sustained over time. Furthermore, the benefits may be
slow to manifest; however, they persist over the long term and
improve health-related quality of life and well-being.

5.3. Environment, air pollution, and
climate change
Air pollution contributes to mortality and morbidity. It specifically
increases the risk of respiratory and CV diseases, notably CAD, HF,
cardiac arrhythmias and arrest, cerebrovascular disease, and venous
thromboembolism. [158][,][673][,][674] Loss of life-expectancy due to ambient
air pollution has been estimated at 2.9 years, accounting for an estimated global excess mortality of 8.8 million/year. [159] Plausible mechanisms by which air pollution is linked to CVD include promoting
atherosclerosis, inflammation, thrombosis, systemic vascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, epigenetic changes, and interactions with
traditional risk factors. [158]

Important sources of fine particles are road traffic, power plants,
and industrial and residential heating using oil, coal, and wood. Main
components of outdoor air pollution include airborne PM (ranging in
size from coarse particles 2.5�10 mm, fine particles <2.5 mm (PM 2.5 ),
and ultrafine particles <0.1 mm in diameter) and gaseous pollutants
such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, volatile organic compounds, carbon
monoxide, and sulphur dioxide, produced primarily by fossil fuel
combustion. [158][,][675] Up to one-third of Europeans living in urban areas

3294 ESC Guidelines


are exposed to levels exceeding EU air-quality standards. The EU
Commission released a policy package to be implemented by 2030,
with measures to reduce harmful emissions from traffic, energy
plants, and agriculture.

Indoor air pollution and exposure to noise must also be highlighted.
Household air pollution, such as that produced from burning biomass,
accounts for over 3 million deaths worldwide. [38] It has been estimated

by the WHO that 30% of the European population is exposed to
nightly levels of noise exceeding 55 dB. [161] These levels have been
associated with hypertension, arteriosclerosis, CAD, CV mortality,
and stroke. It should be noted that mitigating efforts to reduce noise
exposure have not, as yet, proven to have a beneficial health effect. [161]

The extent to which environmental exposures in soil and water
contribute to CVD has also been established. [157] Interventions to

reduce this pollution are required, including factory regulations and
drinking water controls. [157]

Patient organizations and health professionals have an important
role in supporting education and policy initiatives. Information on
patients’ behaviour during smog peaks is needed. Economic
incentives, such as reduced taxes on electric and hybrid cars, can contribute to the improvement of air quality as well as incentives encouraging the use of public transport. Urban design promoting the
construction of new houses and schools in areas remote from highways and polluting industries needs to be urged.
‘Clean air’ legislation aimed at promoting decreased particle emissions,
and promotion of public transport should also be encouraged. The
urgency of accepting what might appear as ‘comfort sacrifices’ for distant
health benefits, and the transitory high costs of reorganizing entire sec

‘Clean air’ legislation aimed at promoting decreased particle emissions,
and promotion of public transport should also be encouraged. The
urgency of accepting what might appear as ‘comfort sacrifices’ for distant
health benefits, and the transitory high costs of reorganizing entire sections of industry, probably remain a major dilemma to the populationbased approach. An example of such legislation is the European Green
Deal, by which the EU aims to be climate neutral by 2050.


6.1.Coronary artery disease
Disease-specific acute management of coronary syndromes is covered in detail in recent guidelines. [677][�][680]

As for antithrombotic therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
for 12 months, preferably with prasugrel or ticagrelor, is the standard
antithrombotic treatment after ACS. [681][�][683] There are conflicting
data as to whether prasugrel is preferable to ticagrelor. [684][,][685] A 6month duration of DAPT after ACS is generally too short, [686] but
may be considered in selected patients at high bleeding risk.

In patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) undergoing

elective PCI, the standard duration of DAPT is 6 months, but short
ening this to 1 - 3 months is an option when bleeding risk is very
high. [622] Clopidogrel is the P2Y 12 inhibitor of choice, but prasugrel
and ticagrelor may be considered after complex interventions. [622]

Prolonged DAPT (>12 months) following PCI for either ACS or
CCS is an option for patients who tolerate DAPT well and have features of high ischaemic risk. [687][,][688] In patients with stable CAD, dualpathway inhibition with low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg b.i.d.) and
aspirin improved CV outcomes at the price of more major bleeding
events than aspirin alone. [83]

Based on the above, and in line with the CCS Guidelines, [622] adding
a second antithrombotic drug (P2Y 12 inhibitor or low-dose rivaroxaban) to aspirin for long-term secondary prevention should be considered for patients who are at high ischaemic risk and do not have a
high risk of bleeding. It may also be considered in patients who are at
moderate ischaemic risk and without a high risk of bleeding, but the
benefits are lower. [622] More details on antithrombotic treatment
options are found in the ESC Guidelines for CCS. [622]


Recommendations for patients with coronary artery
disease



5.3.1.Climate change
Climate change resulting from the increasing use of fossil fuels, as a
major source of both air pollution and ‘greenhouse’ gases, is becoming
a major public health and environmental concern. Societal measures to

reduce such fuels, and transfer towards renewable sources, are becoming urgent to reduce air pollution and climate change. [676] The impact of
diet, notably long-term non-sustainable meat-based food production
chains, as well as the impact of sedentary lifestyles on climate-altering
variables, will also need to be addressed by policy makers.

5.4. Implications for public health policy
and advocacy at the governmental and
non-governmental level

### 6. Risk management of disease- specific cardiovascular disease

This section addresses CVD prevention in specific clinical contexts.
A significant number of patients already have such comorbidities,
which put them at additional risk. The general principles of lifestyle
modification and treatment of major risk factors are outlined in section 4. In this section, only disease-specific aspects are added.

The management of dyslipidaemia and hypertension in patients
with CAD is discussed in sections 4.6 and 4.7, respectively. For ACE
inhibitors (or ARBs) and beta-blockers, see also the 2019 ESC
Guidelines for diagnosis and management of CCS. [622]

6.2. Heart failure

The management of HF aims to improve mortality, hospitalization
rate, and quality of life. [690] To achieve this, multidisciplinary management programmes and structured follow-up with patient education,
optimization of medical treatment, using telehealth facilities, lifestyle
changes, psychosocial support, and improved access to care are
fundamental. [691][�][694]

Regarding the management of CVD risk factors, similar basic rules
apply for those with and without HF. However, in HF, low cholesterol levels [695][,][696] and low body weight are associated with increased
mortality. [697][,][698] Initiation of lipid-lowering therapy is not recommended in patients with HF without compelling indications for their
use. [3] Whereas unintentional weight loss is associated with a worse
prognosis regardless of baseline BMI, the effects of intentional weight

loss remain unclear.

Conversely, regular exercise training (particularly combined aerobic and resistance exercises) improves clinical status in all patients
with HF [650][,][699][,][700] and improves CVD burden and prognosis in
HFrEF. [700][,][701]

It is recommended to screen all patients with HF for both CV and
non-CV comorbidities; if present, they should be treated. [690] These
diseases include CAD, hypertension, lipid disorders, DM, obesity,
cachexia and sarcopenia, thyroid disorders, CKD, anaemia, iron deficiency, and sleep apnoea. [690]

For patients with symptomatic HFrEF, neurohormonal antagonists

[ACE inhibitors, [702][�][705] ARBs, [706] angiotensin receptor neprilysin
inhibitors (ARNIs), [707][�][710] beta-blockers, [711][�][717] and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) [718][,][719] ] improve survival and
reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations. [690] These drugs also reduce the

risk of CV events in patients with symptomatic HFrEF. [702][�][719]

Importantly, these drugs should be up-titrated to the maximum tolerated doses, which may be different for men and women, particularly
in patients recently discharged after HF hospitalization. [690][,][720][,][721]

SGLT2 inhibitors (currently dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) added
on top of neurohormonal blockade reduces the risk of CV death and
worsening HF in patients with symptomatic HFrEF, with or without
DM, [600][,][601] and are recommended for all patients with symptomatic
HFrEF already treated with an ACE inhibitor (or ARNI), a beta
blocker, and an MRA.

Recently, an oral soluble guanylate cyclase receptor stimulator
(vericiguat), administered along with standard neurohormonal blockade in symptomatic patients with HFrEF with recent HF hospitalization, reduced the composite of death from any cause or HF
hospitalization. [722]

Other drugs bring additional moderate benefits for selected
patients with symptomatic HFrEF. Diuretics, [723][,][724] ivabradine, [725][,][726]

and hydralazine [727][,][728] should be considered, and digoxin [729] may be
considered as complementary therapies in specific patients with
symptomatic HFrEF. Some of these therapies reduce CV morbidity
and mortality (e.g. ivabradine).

Additionally, for selected patients with symptomatic HFrEF, there
are indications for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator to reduce
the risk of sudden death and all-cause mortality, and for cardiac
resynchronization therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality (for
details, see 2021 HF Guidelines). [690]

Digoxin may be considered in patients with

symptomatic HFrEF in sinus rhythm despite

treatment with an ACE inhibitor (or ARNI), a

beta-blocker, and an MRA, to reduce the risk of

hospitalizations (all-cause and HF). [729]




6.3. Cerebrovascular diseases

Interventions for cerebrovascular diseases depend on the type of
event, i.e. ischaemic or haemorrhagic. [732][,][733] Ischaemic events are
mainly caused by atherothrombosis, cardiac embolism, or small vessel disease. [734] Other mechanisms (e.g. arterial dissection, patent foramen ovale, thrombophilia, inherited diseases) are relatively rare.
Intracerebral haemorrhage is mostly caused by hypertensive angiopathy and/or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. [735] Bleeding can be precipitated by surges in BP values, use of anticoagulants, or diseases
impairing coagulation. [733][,][735]

In patients with ischaemic stroke or TIA, antithrombotics prevent

further vascular events. Cardioembolic ischaemia, which occurs

mainly in AF, requires anticoagulation (see sections 3.4.3 and
6.6). [736][�][742] In non-cardioembolic mechanism, platelet inhibitors are
recommended. [619][,][620][,][743][�][753]

In non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke, aspirin is the most studied

�
antithrombotic drug. Aspirin 75 150 mg/day reduces the risk of
recurrent ischaemic stroke and serious vascular events. [619][,][743]

Clopidogrel shows slight superiority to aspirin. [620] In patients with
ischaemic stroke or TIA and ipsilateral carotid stenosis, ticagrelor
added to aspirin compared to aspirin alone reduced the risk of stroke
or death at 1 month, without an increase of severe bleeding. [754] Adding
aspirin to clopidogrel was associated with a non-significant reduction in
major vascular events and an increased long-term bleeding risk. [747][�][749]

However, in patients with minor ischaemic stroke or TIA, a short
course of DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel is beneficial. [750][,][751]

Similarly, ticagrelor and aspirin vs. aspirin alone reduces stroke or death
at 30 days after mild-to-moderate ischaemic stroke or TIA not treated
with thrombolysis or thrombectomy. However, DAPT with ticagrelor
and aspirin did not improve the incidence of disability and contributed
to severe bleeding. [755] DAPT with dipyridamole plus aspirin also
showed superiority over aspirin alone. [744] In patients with ischaemic
stroke, however, dipyridamole plus aspirin vs. clopidogrel alone
showed similar rates of recurrent stroke, including haemorrhagic
stroke, [745] but more major haemorrhagic events. In patients with noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke, oral vitamin K antagonists are not
superior to aspirin and carry a higher bleeding risk. [752][,][753] In the absence
of a definite cause of ischaemia and a presumed occult cardioembolic

source (e.g. embolic stroke of undetermined cause), neither dabigatran
nor rivaroxaban are better than aspirin. [756][,][757]

Recommendations for BP and lipid management are congruent to
the general recommendations outlined in sections 4.6 and 4.7.4. In
patients with either ischaemic or haemorrhagic cerebrovascular
disease who have a BP of 140/90 mmHg or higher, lowering BP
reduces the risk of recurrent stroke. [758][,][759] Optimal BP targets
in these patients are uncertain, as is the optimal drug regimen. [760]

Most evidence is available for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics.

Comorbidities may guide the choice of antihypertensive agent. In
patients with recent lacunar stroke, the target SBP is <130 mmHg. [761]

In patients with stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) or TIA with an
LDL-C level of 100 - 190 mg/dL, atorvastatin 80 mg/day reduced the
overall incidence of strokes and CV events. [762] A recent trial supported an LDL-C target of <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). [508]

Evidence of cerebrovascular lesions (e.g. white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, non-lacunar ischaemia) in the absence of any stroke
history is a relatively common finding at neuroimaging, especially in
older patients. Silent cerebrovascular disease is a marker of increased
risk of stroke. [763][,][764] Arterial hypertension, DM, and cigarette smok

history is a relatively common finding at neuroimaging, especially in
older patients. Silent cerebrovascular disease is a marker of increased
risk of stroke. [763][,][764] Arterial hypertension, DM, and cigarette smoking contribute to these lesions and should be attended to. There are
no studies addressing the best treatment options for silent cerebral
ischaemia. [765]




6.4. Lower extremity artery disease
Symptomatic or asymptomatic LEAD (ABI <_0.90) is associated with
a doubling of the 10-year rate of coronary events, CV mortality, and
total mortality. [125] Within 5 years of LEAD diagnosis, 20% develop
AMI or stroke, and mortality is 10�15%. [767]

All LEAD patients require lifestyle improvement and pharmacological therapy. Smoking cessation increases walking distance and lowers
amputation risk. [2] In patients with DM, glycaemic control improves
limb outcomes. [768] Statins provide modest improvements in walking
distance, and lower the risk of adverse limb events. [769][,][770] Combining
a statin with ezetimibe [771] or a PCSK9 inhibitor also has beneficial
effects. [772]

Platelet inhibitors are used to prevent limb-related and general CV
events. The optimal antiplatelet strategy remains unclear. [773] DAPT is
currently recommended only after intervention (irrespective of the
stent type) for at least 1 month.

In the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using
Anticoagulation Strategies) trial, low-dose rivaroxaban added to aspirin
in CVD patients with an ABI <0.90 reduced not only ASCVD events,
but also major adverse limb events, including amputation (HR 0.54),

albeit at the cost of higher major bleeding risk. [774] These results, combined with similar benefits of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin monotherapy, suggest a benefit of anticoagulants in LEAD. However, further studies are
needed. Optimal antithrombotic therapy is addressed in more detail in
the 2017 ESC/European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS)
Guidelines. [775] Importantly, in patients with isolated asymptomatic
LEAD (e.g. low ABI), antiplatelet treatment is not recommended. [775]

Recommendations for BP and lipid management are congruent to
the general recommendations outlined in sections 4.6 and 4.7.
Hypertension targets are based mainly on INVEST (INternational
VErapamil-SR/Trandolapril STudy). [776] An SBP below 110�120 mmHg
may increase CV events in patients with LEAD. [776] ACE inhibitors and
ARBs reduce CV events in patients with LEAD, [575][,][777] and are preferred (as monotherapy or as part of a combination drug regimen). [778]

Beta-blockers are not contraindicated in mild-to-moderate LEAD as
they do not affect walking capacity or adverse limb events, [779] and significantly reduce coronary events. [780] Nevertheless, beta-blockers
should be carefully considered in critical limb-threatening ischaemia.

6.5. Chronic kidney disease
Severe CKD is associated with a very high risk of CVD and is considered a CAD risk equivalent (see section 3.2). As GFR declines, nontraditional risk factors emerge and non-atherosclerotic CVD event
risk increases. [204] Trials often exclude patients with eGFR <30 mL/
min/1.73 m [2] . In patients on dialysis, coronary syndromes may present
atypically, and angina equivalents—such as shortness of breath or
fatigue—are frequent. [788] Standard CVD risk management is effective
in patients on dialysis, but unique haemodialysis-specific syndromes
(i.e. intradialytic hypotension and myocardial stunning) associated
with mortality complicate treatment and modify outcomes.

Risk classification of patients with various degrees of CKD is sum
marized in Table 4. Treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combi
nation is recommended in CKD patients with sufficiently high CVD
risk, but not in those treated with kidney replacement therapy. This
recommendation is built on evidence from SHARP (Study of Heart
and Renal Protection), which demonstrated a reduction of major
atherosclerotic events. [525] Statins should be dosed according to a
moderate-intensity regimen based on limited experience and risks
associated with high-intensity regimens. [543] Subgroup analysis of a
recent study with a PCSK9 inhibitor has shown that the benefits
may extend to those with earlier CKD stages (60�90 as well as
30�60 mL/min/1.73 m [2] ). [789]

Treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is recommended in

patients with DM, hypertension, and albuminuria. These medications
should be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose (Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes grading 1B).
Individualized HbA1c targets, ranging from 6.5% to <8.0% in
patients with DM and non-dialysis-dependent CKD, are recommended in parallel. The role of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs in
CKD associated with DM is addressed in section 4.8. Dapagliflozin has
shown promising reno- and cardioprotective effects, [599] and more
studies investigating SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD patients without DM
are ongoing. [790]

Overall, the management of CAD in CKD patients must be
informed by the modification of its clinical presentation in CKD, as
well as comorbidity and risks of treatment side-effects. Treatment of
established risk factors is often suboptimal in patients with CKD.

6.6. Atrial fibrillation

The simple ‘Atrial fibrillation Better Care’ (ABC) holistic pathway
(‘A’ = Anticoagulation/Avoid stroke; ‘B’ = Better symptom management; ‘C’ = Cardiovascular and Comorbidity optimization)
streamlines integrated care of patients with AF. [215] The ABC pathway lowers risk of all-cause death and the composite of stroke,
major bleeding, CV death, or first hospitalization, [791] and lowers
rates of CV events [792][,][793] and health-related costs. [794]

The ‘C’ component of the ABC pathway refers to identification
and management of concomitant diseases, cardiometabolic risk
factors, and unhealthy lifestyle factors. Therapy of underlying conditions improves rhythm control in persistent AF and HF. [216] In
obese patients, weight reduction prevents AF recurrences and
symptoms. [795][�][802] Given that hypertension precipitates AF, treatment of hypertension is mandatory. Alcohol excess is a risk factor
for incident AF, [803][,][804] and abstinence reduced AF recurrences in
regular drinkers. [798] Many studies have demonstrated beneficial
effects of moderate exercise/PA. [805][�][807] The incidence of AF

appears, however, to be increased in elite athletes, mainly related
to endurance sports. [808][�][811] Patients should be encouraged to
practise moderate-intensity exercise and remain physically active
to prevent AF incidence or recurrence, but avoid excessive
endurance exercise. CR is a universally recommended programme for patients with ACS and/or revascularization, and for
patients with HF. [639][,][640][,][655] The benefits of EBCR are more uncertain in patients with AF, but CR remains recommended in patients
with the aforementioned indications. [812] Continuous PAP may
improve rhythm control and attenuate AF recurrences in OSA
patients. [813][�][816] Intensive glycaemic control does not affect the
rate of new-onset AF. [817] Optimal glycaemic control during the 12

months before AF ablation does, however, reduce AF recurrence
after ablation. [818] All patients with HF and AF should receive
guideline-adherent HF therapy. [819]

ESC Guidelines 3299


So far, guidance for the treatment of CVD has focused mainly on
single CVDs. In multimorbid patients, application of a single guideline
for one CVD is often not feasible as therapeutic competition is highly
prevalent (22.6%) [820] and treatment for one condition can worsen a
coexisting condition. The challenges for managing CVD and multimorbidity are disease-disease, disease-drug, and drug-drug interactions. [820] Further, pharmacokinetics can be different in patients with
comorbidities, and life expectancy has to be taken into account when
starting a new medication. A value-based approach should always be
discussed and proposed when possible. [820] The incremental benefit of
medication when added to an already complex regimen is often
uncertain. [828] Moreover, care for multimorbid CVD patients is often
fragmented and given by multiple providers, complicating decisionmaking and adherence to recommended treatment. [820]

Multimorbid CVD patients have been underrepresented in most
clinical trials that underlie the guidelines. Trials including patients with
multimorbidity and endpoints that matter to patients, pragmatic trials, and the use of registries and big data could help elucidate how to
optimize treatment and care for patients with CVD and
multimorbidity. [820]

There is a plea for a paradigm shift from disease-focused to
patient-centred care for multimorbid CVD patients, with a central
place for patients’ overarching goals of care. [828] ‘What matters to
you?’ should be the central question, instead of ‘what is the matter?’.

Patient-centred care should include assessment of patients’ preferences, interpretation of the evidence and its application to the specific patient, consideration of overall prognosis, including life
expectancy, functional status, and quality of life, and clinical feasibility.
Adherence to treatment, the occurrence of adverse drug events, the
economic burden, and the stress experienced by caregivers should
be taken into account when optimizing therapies and care plans
where adherence to essential medication is emphasized and nonessential drugs are stopped. [828] Furthermore, advanced care planning
should be initiated early. Multidisciplinary teams and close collaboration between primary care workers and specialists is needed. Finally,
automated decision support systems for multimorbidity and CVD
could help in aligning the relevant evidence and making adequate
decisions. [829]

6.7. Multimorbidity
The older adult population is growing fast and survival after acute
CVD has improved, [820] leading to an increasing number of older
patients with CVD and multimorbidity. [821][,][822] This development is
associated with high healthcare costs, [823][,][824] worse outcome measures, higher readmission rates, [825] and mortality. [826]

Up to 70% of patients aged >_70 years have at least one CVD and
two-thirds also develop non-CVD comorbidities. Multimorbidity is
important in patients with CVD. [823]

The prevailing CV conditions in patients aged >60 years are hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, ischaemic heart disease, arrhythmia, DM,
and CAD. [823] Other frequent comorbidities include anaemia and
arthritis. Low vision, back and neck problems, osteoarthritis, COPD,
depression, and cancer are the most common non-CV comorbidities
in CVD patients. Most studies have found no sex differences in the

number of comorbidities. However, men have more CVD comorbid
ities and women have more non-CVD comorbidities (in particular
more depression). [822][,][826][,][827]

patients, based on combinations of a renin angiotensin system
(RAS) blocker with a CCB or thiazide/thiazide-like diuretic, or all
three. Beta-blockers may also be used where there is a
guideline-directed indication.

- [Many patients with hypertension will be at sufficient risk to bene-]

fit from statin therapy for primary prevention. Antiplatelet therapy is indicated for secondary prevention.

- [A multifactorial approach, including lifestyle changes, is critical in]

persons with type 2 DM.

- [Management of hyperglycaemia reduces the risk of microvascu-]

lar complications and, to a lesser extent, the risk of CVD.
Glycaemic targets should be relaxed in older adults and frail

individuals.

- [New antihyperglycaemic drugs are particularly important for per-]

 - [The percentage of those exercising at a regular level is greater in]

men than in women.

 - [Global progress to increase PA has been slow, largely due to]

lack of awareness and investment.

 - [The optimal dose of different types of PA for CVD and general]

prevention is still controversial and subjected to frequent
updates. Increasing moderate-to-vigorous PA and reducing sitting time, however, is beneficial and any level of PA is considered

better than none.

 - [PA for health promotion should be implemented by physicians]

in the same way as drug prescription and should also be promoted by other healthcare professionals.

 - [Population-based interventions are effective in promoting]

PA for groups based on age, sex, and race, for high-, middle-, and
low-income populations, and for different environments
(e.g. kindergarten, school, gyms, companies, and worksites in
general).

### 10. Quality indicators

Quality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care
quality, including that of processes of care and clinical outcomes. [730]

They may also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to
guideline recommendations, through quality assurance endeavours
and benchmarking of care providers. [831] As such, the role of QIs in
driving quality improvement is increasingly recognized and attracts
interest from healthcare authorities, professional organizations,
payers, and the public. [832]

The ESC recognizes the need for measuring and reporting the
quality and outcomes of CV care. One aspect of this is the development and implementation of QIs for CVD. The methodology by
which the ESC QIs are developed has been published [832] and, to date,
a suite of QIs for an initial tranche of CV conditions has been produced. [833][,][834] To facilitate quality improvement initiatives, the diseasespecific ESC QIs are included in corresponding ESC Clinical Practice
Guidelines. [215][,][680] This is further enhanced by way of their integration
into the EORP (EURObservational Research Programme) and the
EuroHeart (European Unified Registries On Heart Care Evaluation
and Randomized Trials) project. [835]

For CVD prevention, QIs are available for specific conditions, such
as the management of high BP [836] and secondary lipid prevention. [837]

However, a comprehensive set of QIs that encompasses the depth
and breadth of CVD prevention is lacking. Such a set may evaluate
the adoption of, and adherence to, the guideline recommendations
provided in this document, and may be applied retrospectively to
assess the delivery of evidence-based care. Thus, and in line with
other ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines, the process of developing and
defining QIs for CVD prevention has been initiated during the writing
of this guideline and the results will be published in a separate
