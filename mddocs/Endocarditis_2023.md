of their publication. The ESC is not responsible in the event of any contradiction, discrepancy, and/or ambiguity between the ESC Guidelines and any other official recommendations or
guidelines issued by the relevant public health authorities, in particular, in relation to good use of healthcare or therapeutic strategies. Health professionals are encouraged to take the
ESC Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic medical strategies;
however, the ESC Guidelines do not override, in any way whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each
patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient and, where appropriate and/or necessary, the patient’s caregiver. Nor do the ESC Guidelines exempt health professionals from
taking into full and careful consideration the relevant official updated recommendations or guidelines issued by the competent public health authorities, in order to manage each patient’s case
in light of the scientifically accepted data pursuant to their respective ethical and professional obligations. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the applicable rules and
regulations relating to drugs and medical devices at the time of prescription.

ESC Guidelines **3953**

#### **1. Preamble**

Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence, with the aim of as-­
sisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic
approach for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines are in-­
tended for use by health professionals and the European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) makes its Guidelines freely available.

ESC Guidelines do not override the individual responsibility of health
professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration
of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient or

pathology. The selection procedure aimed to include members from
across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty
Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion, notably
with respect to gender and country of origin. The Task Force performed a
critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, including as-­
sessment of the risk-benefit ratio. The strength of every recommendation
and the level of evidence supporting them were weighed and scored ac-­
cording to predefined scales as outlined below. The Task Force followed
ESC voting procedures, and all approved recommendations were subject
to a vote and achieved at least 75% agreement among voting members.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of
interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or po-­
tential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest were
reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and can be

have been compiled in a report published in a supplementary document
with the guidelines. The Task Force received its entire financial support
from the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.

The ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee supervises and
co-ordinates the preparation of new guidelines and is responsible for the
approval process. ESC Guidelines undergo extensive review by the CPG
Committee and external experts, including members from across the
whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty
Communities and National Cardiac Societies. After appropriate revisions,
the guidelines are signed off by all the experts involved in the Task Force.
The finalized document is signed off by the CPG Committee for publica-­
tion in the *European Heart Journal* . The guidelines were developed after
careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evi-­
dence available at the time of their writing. Tables of evidence summariz-­
ing the findings of studies informing development of the guidelines are
included. The ESC warns readers that the technical language may be mis-­
interpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect.

Off-label use of medication may be presented in this guideline if a suf-­
ficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically ap-­
propriate for a given condition. However, the final decisions
concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health
professional giving special consideration to:

- The specific situation of the patient. Unless otherwise provided for
by national regulations, off-label use of medication should be limited
to situations where it is in the patient’s interest with regard to the
quality, safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has
been informed and has provided consent.

- Country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental
drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which health profes-­
sionals are subject, where applicable.
#### **2. Introduction**

Infective endocarditis (IE) is a major public health challenge. [1] In 2019, the
estimated incidence of IE was 13.8 cases per 100 000 subjects per year,
and IE accounted for 66 300 deaths worldwide. [2] Due to the associated

high morbidity and mortality (1723.59 disability-adjusted life years and
0.87 death cases per 100 000 population, respectively), identification of
the best preventive strategies has been the focus of research. [2][,][3] Since the
publication of the *2015 ESC Guidelines for the management of infective endo-­*
*carditis*, [4] important new data have been published mandating an update of
recommendations. First, the population at risk of IE has increased and new
data on IE in different clinical scenarios have arisen. [5][–][11] Furthermore, the

emerging and increasing antibiotic resistance among oral streptococci is


of concern. The rate of resistance to azythromycin and clarithromycin is
higher than that to penicillin. [12] Whether changes in national guidelines on
the use of antibiotic prophylaxis have resulted in an increase in the incidence
of IE remains unclear. [13][–][18] It is likely that the increased use of diagnostic
tools to diagnose IE is an important contributor to the increase in the inci-­
dence of IE. The use of echocardiography has probably increased in patients
with positive blood cultures for *Enteroccus faecalis*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, or
streptococci due to the associated increased risk of IE. [19] In addition, com-­
puted tomography (CT) and nuclear imaging techniques have increased the
number of definite IE cases particularly among patients with prosthetic
valves and implantable cardiac devices. [20][–][22]

Data on the contemporary characterization of patients with IE have
been taken into consideration to update the recommendations on the
diagnosis and management of patients with IE. [5][,][19][,][23][–][41] Furthermore,
the recommendations on antibiotic therapy have been updated based
on the susceptibility of various microorganisms defined by the
European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
(EUCAST) clinical breakpoints. [42] Recommendations on outpatient par-­
enteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) or oral antibiotic treatment have

been included based on the results of the Partial Oral Treatment of
Endocarditis (POET) randomized trial and other trials. [43][–][46]

The main objective of the current Task Force was to provide clear
and simple recommendations, assisting healthcare providers in their
clinical decision-making. These recommendations were obtained by ex-­
pert consensus after thorough review of the available literature (see
[Supplementary data, evidence tables online). An evidence-based scor-­](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)
ing system was used, based on a classification of the strength of recom-­
mendations and the levels of evidence.

#### **3. Prevention**

**3.1. Rationale**

The development of IE usually requires several conditions, including the
presence of predisposing risk factors (i.e. a surface/structure that could
be colonized by bacteria), pathogens entering the bloodstream, and the
competence of the host’s immune response. The role of predisposing
risk factors has been recently underscored by Thornhill *et al.* [47]

Predisposing risk factors conveying a moderate and high risk of IE
had an incidence of 280 and 497 cases per 100 000 subjects per year,
respectively. [47]

The portals of entry of bacteria/fungi are variable and include: (i) in-­
fections of the skin, oral cavity, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary system;
(ii) direct inoculation in people who inject drugs (PWID), or by any un-­
safe or unprotected vascular puncture; (iii) healthcare exposure (in-­
cluding a variety of invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures,
such as transcatheter or surgical techniques). [6][,][11][,][48][–][50]

The oral cavity is colonized by relevant commensal flora, including
oral group streptococci, and represents an important entry port.
Oral surgery procedures (including all extractions, periodontal surgery,


implant surgery, and oral biopsies) and dental procedures that involve
manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of the teeth are consid-­
ered at high risk of causing bacteraemia. [11][,][48][,][49][,][51]

Successful antibiotic prophylaxis assumes that reducing the bacter-­
aemia associated with medical procedures will lead to a reduced risk
of IE. This concept was supported by a few animal models and obser-­
vational studies that led to the recommendation for antibiotic prophy-­
laxis in a large number of patients with predisposing cardiac conditions
undergoing a wide range of procedures. [4][,][14][,][52][–][60]

However, systematic use of antibiotic prophylaxis has been ques-­
tioned based on several considerations, the most important being the
lack of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrating the efficacy of
antibiotic prophylaxis prior to medical procedures in preventing IE.
Such trials would entail enrolment of a very large number of individuals
and prolonged follow-up, making the feasibility of such studies improb-­
able. Furthermore, since the standard of care for high-risk individuals is
antibiotic prophylaxis (to date, mostly before invasive oro-dental pro-­
cedures), there may not be sufficient equipoise to perform such RCTs.
Finally, the costs of performing such trials have been considered un-­
acceptable. [61] To overcome these limitations, population-based studies

**3960** ESC Guidelines


have evaluated the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis using bacteraemia
as a surrogate of IE. [16][–][18][,][52][,][62] However, the relationship between bac-­
teraemia and IE is not straightforward. Bacteraemia may be caused by
daily activities such as tooth brushing, flossing, and chewing, and al-­
though these constitute low-level bacteraemia, they occur repetitively
and may therefore outweigh the risk of bacteraemia associated with
dental procedures. [48][,][49] A meta-analysis of 36 studies, including 21 trials
that investigated the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of
bacteraemia following dental procedures, demonstrated that antibiotic
prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence of bacteraemia, but did
not lead to a statistically significant protective effect against IE in casecontrol studies. [52] Additionally, the potential risk of anaphylaxis, [63] or
other adverse side effects in a small minority of patients, and the fact
that a widespread use of antibiotics may be associated with antibiotic
resistance, are areas of concern. [57][,][58][,][64][–][67] While some studies did not
demonstrate significant increases in IE-related hospitalizations and
death rates after scaling down antibiotic prophylaxis indications, [68][–][77]

others showed an increase in the incidence of IE among individuals at
moderate and high risk of IE. [13][,][26][,][59][,][78][–][81] A meta-analysis including 16
studies reporting over 1.3 million cases of IE has shown that restricting
antibiotic prophylaxis to only high-risk individuals has not resulted in an
increase in the incidence of streptococcal IE in a North American popu-­
lation (despite the fact that it was unable to draw that conclusion for
other populations). [18] In contrast, a systematic review including multiple
nationwide population-based studies in Europe has shown a 4% per
year rise in the incidence of IE. [82] These contrasting results may be ex-­
plained by differences in the methodology of the studies (retrospective,
population- or health-system-based studies that relied on claims data or
epidemiological observations to estimate the incidence of IE), greater
disease diagnosis with the use of newer imaging technologies, lack of
microbiological data, and the lack of specific International
Classification of Diseases codes for oral streptococci. [83] Recently, it
has been shown that antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk individuals was
associated with a significant reduction of IE after invasive dental proce-­
dures (particularly extractions and oral surgical procedures). [11][,][51] After
careful consideration of all the new studies published after 2015, the
present Task Force decided to revise and update the risk categories
for IE, strengthening the recommendation of antibiotic prophylaxis,
clarifying the definition of the population at risk, and considering the ad-­
vances in transcatheter valve interventions.

**3.2. Populations at risk of infective**
**endocarditis**

The groups of individuals at high risk of IE in whom antibiotic prophy-­
laxis is recommended or should be considered include the following:

(i) Patients with previous IE: the highest risk of IE is observed in pa-­

tients with previous history of IE who have an ominous prognosis
during IE-related hospitalization. Patients with recurrent IE more
frequently have prosthetic valves or prosthetic material, are
more commonly PWID, or have staphylococcal IE. [47][,][84][–][86]

(ii) Patients with surgically implanted prosthetic valves, with transcath-­

eter implanted prosthetic valves, and with any material used for
cardiac valve repair: the increased risk of IE in these patients, com-­
bined with the ominous outcomes as compared with patients with
native IE (NVE), make antibiotic prophylaxis advisable in this pa-­
tient group. Patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE)
have an in-hospital mortality rate that is twice as high with more
complications (e.g. heart failure [HF], conduction disturbances)
as compared with patients with NVE, regardless of the


pathogen. [87][,][88] Furthermore, mitral and aortic bioprostheses may
be associated with increased risk of IE as compared with mechan-­
ical prostheses, [89][,][90] and bioprostheses are being implanted in an
ever-increasing proportion of patients requiring valve replacement
therapy. The indication for prophylaxis also expands to transcath-­
eter aortic and pulmonic prosthetic valves, since IE is also asso-­
ciated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality in these
patients. [91][–][94] In terms of transcatheter mitral and tricuspid valve
interventions, the data on the risk of IE are limited. [95] Patients
with septal defect closure devices, left atrial appendage closure de-­
vices, vascular grafts, vena cava filters, and central venous system
ventriculo-atrial shunts are considered within this risk category in
the first 6 months after implantation. [96]

(iii) Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) (not including iso-­

lated congenital valve abnormalities) are at increased risk of
IE. [8][,][47][,][97][–][99] The cumulative incidence over time is influenced
strongly by the improved long-term survival of children with
CHD into adulthood. [98] Indeed, there are now more adults living
with CHD than children with CHD. [100] The overall incidence

rate of IE among adult patients with CHD is 27–44 times that re-­
ported for contemporary adults of the general population (1.33
cases per 1000 persons per year) [8] while in children with CHD
the incidence of IE is 0.41 cases per 1000 persons per year. [101]

CHD groups at increased risk include those with untreated cyan-­
otic CHD, and those whose surgery includes prosthetic material,
including valved conduits or systemic to pulmonary shunts. [8][,][47][,][97]

The risk of post-operative IE for CHD patients undergoing trans-­
catheter atrial or ventricular septal defect closure with devices or
surgery with non-valve-related prosthetic material is also in-­
creased, but predominantly for the first 6 months after surgery. [8]

(iv) Patients with ventricular assist devices as destination therapy are
also considered at high risk because of associated morbidity and
mortality, and prophylaxis is also recommended in such patients. [102]

Patients at intermediate risk of IE include those with: (i) rheumatic
heart disease (RHD); (ii) non-rheumatic degenerative valve disease;
(iii) congenital valve abnormalities including bicuspid aortic valve dis-­
ease; (iv) cardiovascular implanted electronic devices (CIEDs); and (v)
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. [47][,][103][,][104] Some epidemiological data sug-­
gest that certain conditions stratified as intermediate risk are associated

Table 5 **General prevention measures to be followed in**
**patients at high and intermediate risk of infective**
**endocarditis**









ESC Guidelines **3961**


with a higher risk of IE compared with the background popula-­
tion, [47][,][90][,][103] but further studies are required. In patients at intermediate
risk of IE, antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended and may
be considered on an individual basis. However, prevention measures
( *Table 5* ) are strongly encouraged in these patients. [7]

Most of the IE in recipients of solid organ transplant is nosocomial. A
recent systematic review of patient-level data including 57 heart trans-­
plant patients has shown that IE occurs frequently during the first year
post-transplant, and the most common pathogen is *S. aureus* followed
by *Aspergillus fumigatus* . [105] Oral streptococci are a very infrequent
cause of IE, making the value of antibiotic prophylaxis after invasive orodental procedures questionable. However, IE in this group of patients is
associated with very high mortality, particularly in patients with fungal
IE. In contrast, other series that include a larger proportion of noncardiac solid organ transplant patients have shown that the pathogens
are more frequently from the *Staphylococcus* spp. and the mortality
seems to be similar to that of patients without solid organ
transplant. [106][,][107]

**3.3. Situations and procedures at risk**
**3.3.1. Dental procedures**
Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in patients at high risk of IE under-­
going at-risk dental procedures and is not currently recommended in other
situations. At-risk dental procedures include dental extractions, oral sur-­
gery procedures (including periodontal surgery, implant surgery, and oral
biopsies), and dental procedures involving manipulation of the gingival or
periapical region of the teeth (including scaling and root canal proce-­
dures). [49][,][108] The use of dental implants raises concerns about potential
risk due to foreign material at the interface between the buccal cavity
and blood, but available data remain very limited. [109] So far there is no evi-­
dence to contraindicate implants in all patients at risk and the indication
should be discussed on an individual basis. Implant placement procedures,
and invasive dental procedures on established implants, however, should
be covered by antibiotic prophylaxis in those at high risk of IE. Once dental
implants are placed in high-risk patients, professional dental hygiene and
follow-up should be performed at least twice yearly under antibiotic cover,

when indicated.

The main target for antibiotic prophylaxis is oral streptococci.
*Table 6* summarizes the main regimens of antibiotic prophylaxis recom-­
mended before dental procedures. The risk of adverse fatal/non-fatal
events appear to be extremely low for amoxicillin but high for clinda-­
mycin (mainly related to *Clostridioides difficile* infections). [63][,][110][–][112]

Accordingly, this Task Force does not recommend the use of clindamy-­
cin for antibiotic prophylaxis.

No convincing evidence has been brought forward on the relationship
between bacteraemia resulting from a non-dental procedure and risk of
subsequent IE. However, observational studies reported that, com-­
pared with patients with IE not undergoing an invasive procedure,

several invasive non-dental medical procedures were associated with
increased risk of IE, including cardiovascular interventions, skin proce-­
dures and wound management, transfusion, dialysis, bone marrow
puncture, and endoscopic procedures. [6][,][11][,][51] For this reason, an aseptic
operational environment should be ensured during all these proce-­
dures to minimize the risk of IE. As previously indicated, it is very unlike-­
ly that an RCT on antibiotic prophylaxis for IE will be performed in the
foreseeable future. However, at-risk patients have longer survival due
to the advent of newer medical and device-based medical therapies.
In addition, the ageing general population with their accumulating num-­
ber of co-morbidities has an increased risk of surgical therapy, if IE oc-­
curs. For these reasons, this Task Force no longer felt that a class III
recommendation for antibiotic prophylaxis in high-risk patients under-­
going non-dental medical procedures (see Recommendation Table 2)
was appropriate, despite the limitations of observational data used to
support this class IIb recommendation.

**3.3.3. Cardiac or vascular interventions**

In all patients undergoing implantation of a prosthetic valve, any type of
prosthetic graft/occluder device or CIED, peri-operative antibiotic


prophylaxis is recommended due to the increased risk and adverse out-­
come of an infection. [6] The most frequent microorganisms underlying
early (1 year after surgery) surgical PVE are coagulase-negative
staphylococci (CoNS) and *S. aureus* . Pre-operative screening of nasal
carriage for *S. aureus* is recommended before elective cardiac surgery
or transcatheter valve implantation to treat carriers using local mupir-­
ocin and chlorhexidine. [113][,][114] Rapid identification techniques using gene
amplification are useful to avoid delaying urgent surgery. Systematic lo-­
cal treatment without screening is not recommended. It is strongly re-­
commended that potential sources of dental sepsis should be
eliminated at least 2 weeks before implantation of a prosthetic valve
or other intracardiac or intravascular foreign material unless the latter
procedure is urgent. For specific prophylactic measures in other cardiac
and vascular interventions (i.e. CIED, transcatheter aortic valve implant-­
[ation [TAVI]), please see the Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Section S1.1* .

**3.4. Patient education**

Preventing IE also depends on preventive measures other than antibiot-­
ic prophylaxis. People at risk should be educated to maintain good den-­
tal and skin hygiene, to look out for signs of infection and, when

experiencing fever of unknown origin, report to their physician that
they are at risk, in which case clinicians should consider screening for
IE before initiating antibiotics.

Use of non-medical language, visual aids, digital tools, repetition, and
teach back methods all aid the patients’ comprehension and is encour-­
aged. [115] National cardiology societies should be encouraged to develop
specific IE cards for patient awareness ( *Figure 2* ).

#### **4. The Endocarditis Team**

The importance of an Endocarditis Team in the diagnosis, management,
and clinical outcomes of patients with IE has been demonstrated in sev-­
eral observational studies. [36][–][41][,][122][–][126] Establishing multidisciplinary
endocarditis teams according to the European Society of Cardiology
(ESC) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association Guidelines [4][,][127][,][128] has resulted in earlier and more accurate
diagnosis of the primary disease and its complications, [5][,][22][,][31][,][40][,][129] uni-­
form antibiotic treatment, [36][,][40][,][123] and optimized timing for surgical
intervention. [36][,][37][,][40][,][123] A variety of scenarios of patients presenting
with IE justifies a multidisciplinary approach. [5][,][25][,][27][,][28][,][130][–][135]

Furthermore, the clinical presentation may vary significantly depending
on the characteristics of the host and virulence of the microorganism.
Accordingly, the concept of the Endocarditis Team needs to embrace a
multidisciplinary approach that must adapt according to the patient’s
clinical needs and the local epidemiology to ensure prompt diagnosis

and treatment.

The members of the Endocarditis Team should include the specialists
with direct involvement in the diagnostic and therapeutic processes
( *Table 7* ), and may vary depending on the type of centre. In the

Heart Valve Centre, a centre having all diagnostic and therapeutic re-­
sources to treat IE, the core members of the Endocarditis Team should
include cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons, infectious disease specia-­
lists (or internal medicine specialists with expertise in infectious dis-­
eases), and microbiologists. Furthermore, for specific clinical
questions, cardiologists/surgeons with expertise in CIED extraction,
HF, and CHD; pathologists; critical care specialists; cardiac anaesthesiol-­
ogists; interventional cardiologists; neurologists and neurosurgeons;
pharmacologists; radiologists and nuclear medicine specialists;


nephrologists; geriatricians; and multidisciplinary addiction medicine
teams (psychiatrists, nurses, and social work specialists providing coun-­
selling) are crucial adjuncts that should be available onsite for consult-­
ation. Specific subgroups of complex and high-risk patients are
frequently assessed by the Endocarditis Team. The decision-making
process may involve difficult decisions regarding continuation of ther-­
apy, and legal counsel may therefore be required.

Cardiovascular imaging has achieved such an advanced sophistication
in the diagnosis of IE that the cardiologists with expertise in

ESC Guidelines **3965**


multimodality imaging are key in the Endocarditis Team. In addition,
radiology and nuclear medicine specialists with expertise on clinical car-­
diovascular imaging should be available whenever indicated. [22][,][31][,][129] The
Endocarditis Team must meet on a frequent basis and work with stand-­
ard operating procedures and the clinical governance arrangements de-­
fined locally. [128][,][136] Although the decision of timing is left to the
discretion of the local team, a weekly meeting is to be considered.

In Referring Centres, i.e. those without a cardiovascular surgical
team, the treating physician diagnosing IE should consult with a special-­
ist in infectious diseases (or an internal medicine specialist with expert-­
ise in infectious diseases) and the microbiologist. [136] In addition, a
cardiologist with expertise in valvular heart disease and cardiac imaging
should be present to provide the initial and subsequent evaluations with
echocardiography. Information of the strains of the isolated microor-­
ganisms, usually kept for 7–15 days, should be provided to the Heart
Valve Centre if requested.

Communication between Referring Centres and the Heart Valve
Centres should be facilitated with digital solutions that enable reliable
data sharing. Early referral to the Heart Valve Centre for further diag-­
nostic testing and clinical management should be available when
deemed necessary ( *Figure 3* ). When there is evidence of failure to re-­
spond to the antibiotic therapy or there are complications related to
valvular tissue destruction, the Referring Centre should consult the

Heart Valve Centre. The Endocarditis Team of the Heart Valve

Centre should share protocols with the physicians from the referring
hospitals and should facilitate their continuing education. [136]

A critical aspect of the Endocarditis Team decision-making process is
defining when a patient must be transferred to a Heart Valve Centre to
expedite advanced diagnostics and therapy. The indications for transfer
are comprehensive, to facilitate interhospital communication and avoid
delaying therapy to improve prognosis.

imaging technique. Other imaging modalities such as CT, nuclear im-­
aging, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently part of the
diagnostic strategy of suspected IE, given their ability to provide key in-­
formation to confirm IE diagnosis, to assess local IE complications as
well as IE-related distant lesions, and to identify the original source of
bacteraemia in patients who develop secondary IE. [137] Beyond diagnosis
of IE, imaging findings also have prognostic implications.

**5.1. Clinical features**

Infective endocarditis remains a diagnostic challenge due to its variable
clinical presentation. In general, a diagnosis of IE should be considered in
all patients with sepsis or fever of unknown origin in the presence of risk
factors. Infective endocarditis may present as an acute, rapidly progres-­
sive infection, but also as a subacute or chronic disease with low-grade,
or even no fever, and non-specific symptoms that may mislead or con-­
fuse initial assessment. Infective endocarditis can also present with a
complication mimicking a wide range of medical conditions that may
prompt evaluation of other diseases, such as rheumatological, neuro-­
logical, and autoimmune disorders, or even malignancy, before reaching
a diagnosis of IE. Therefore, high suspicion for IE is generally driven by
fever and positive blood cultures in the absence of an alternative focus
of infection, especially in patients with one or more risk factors. Early
involvement of the Endocarditis Team to guide management is highly

recommended.

The initial clinical assessment should include evaluation of cardiac and

non-cardiac risk factors ( *Table 8* ), supportive clinical context, and phys-­
ical examination findings including potential portals of entry. Physical
examination may reveal a variety of clinical signs. However, the absence
of clinical signs alone should not exclude IE since the overall sensitivity
and specificity of the clinical signs are low.

In the European Infective Endocarditis Registry (EURO-ENDO), fe-­
ver (77.7%), cardiac murmur (64.5%), and congestive HF (27.2%) were
the most frequent clinical presentations. [5] Embolic complications were
detected in 25.3% of patients and cardiac conduction abnormalities
were found in 11.5%. Some classical signs, such as peripheral stigmata,
are less frequently observed, but may still be observed in severe infec-­
tions caused by *S. aureus* and in cases of subacute endocarditis (mainly
caused by *Streptococcis* spp.). However, vascular and immunological
phenomena, such as splinter haemorrhages, [138] Roth spots, and

#### **5. Diagnosis**











The diagnosis of IE is based on a clinical suspicion supported by consist-­
ent microbiological data and the documentation of IE-related cardiac
lesions by imaging techniques. Evidence of involvement of cardiac valves

nostic criterion of IE. Echocardiography is the first-line diagnostic

glomerulonephritis, remain common. The main symptoms and signs
observed in the EURO-ENDO registry are shown in the
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Table S1* . Atypical presentation is common
in elderly or immunocompromised patients. [139][–][141] A high index of sus-­
picion and low threshold for investigation are therefore essential to ex-­
clude IE or avoid delays in diagnosis in these and other high-risk groups,
such as those with CHD or prosthetic valves. [142] It is important to in-­
form those patients about the risk of IE who should be aware of com-­
patible symptoms to ask for advice in referral centres.

**5.2. Laboratory findings**
Laboratory investigations and biomarkers typically yield non-specific re-­
sults. A large number of potential biomarkers have been proposed, re-­
flecting the complex pathophysiology of the pro- and anti-inflammatory
processes, humoral and cellular reactions, and both circulatory and
end-organ abnormalities involved in IE. [143] The degree of anaemia,
leucocytosis/leucopaenia, the number of immature white cell forms,
concentrations of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, and markers of end-organ dysfunction (serum lac-­
tate, serum creatinine, bilirubin, thrombocytopaenia, cardiac troponin,
and natriuretic brain peptides) can be used to estimate the severity of
sepsis, but none is diagnostic of IE. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin
are the most widely evaluated biomarkers in RCTs of antibiotic stew-­
ardship. Furthermore, several of these biomarkers are included in
scores used for risk stratification in critically ill patients.
Unfortunately, no biomarker has sufficient accuracy for the diagnosis
of sepsis or specificity for IE. [144] Therefore, the main role of biomarkers
is to facilitate initial risk stratification and monitor the response to anti-­
biotic therapy.

**5.3. Microbiological diagnosis**
The aetiology of IE is described in the EURO-ENDO registry [5] and the
International Collaboration on Endocarditis-Prospective Cohort Study
(ICE-PCS). [145] In 2009, the ICE-PCS showed that the most frequent mi-­
croorganisms causing IE were *S. aureus* (31%), followed by oral strepto-­
cocci (17%), and CoNS (11%). [145] Similar results were reported in the
EURO-ENDO registry. [5][,][145] Other registries have highlighted the
increasing incidence of IE caused by *E. faecalis* and CoNS, particularly
in the elderly. [146][–][149] However, the results of these registries
should be carefully interpreted due to inherent biases (type of partici-­
pating centres, geographical differences, lack of complete granular data,
etc.).

**5.3.1. Blood culture-positive infective endocarditis**
Positive blood cultures remain the cornerstone of IE diagnosis and pro-­
vide live bacteria for both identification and susceptibility testing. At
least three sets of blood cultures should be obtained at 30-minute in-­
tervals prior to antibiotic therapy, each containing 10 mL of blood,
and should be incubated in both aerobic and anaerobic atmo-­
spheres. [150][,][151] Sampling should be obtained from a peripheral vein ra-­
ther than from a central venous catheter (because of the risk of
contamination and misleading interpretation), using a meticulous sterile
technique. In the absence of previous antimicrobial therapy, this is vir-­
tually always sufficient to identify the usual causative microorganisms.
The need for culture before antibiotic administration is self-evident.

In IE, bacteraemia is almost constant and has two implications: (i) there
is no rationale for delaying blood sampling to coincide with peaks of


fever; and (ii) nearly all blood cultures are positive during bacteraemia.
As a result, a single positive blood culture should be regarded cautiously
for establishing IE diagnosis. The microbiology laboratory should be
aware of the clinical suspicion of IE. Automated machines perform con-­
tinuous monitoring of bacterial growth, which ensures quick provision
of reports to physicians. When a positive blood culture is identified,
presumptive identification is based on Gram staining. This information
is immediately given to clinicians in order to adapt empirical antibiotic
therapy. Complete identification is routinely achieved the same day
or the following day with current methodology (e.g. matrix-assisted la-­
ser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry

[MALDI-TOF MS]), but may require a longer time for fastidious or
atypical organisms. Since there is a long delay between blood culture
sampling and definitive identification of the organism responsible for
the bacteraemia and antibiotic susceptibility testing, many improve-­
ments have been proposed to speed up the process of detection and
identification. One of the most recent procedures for rapid bacterial
identification is based on peptide spectra obtained by MALDI-TOF
MS. [152] However, despite technical developments and the progress to-­
ward rapid susceptibility testing using MALDI-TOF MS, the gold stand-­
ard for susceptibility testing is still the determination of the minimal
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to select appropriate antibiotic ther-­
apy, which needs to be performed following validated, standardized
methodology. [153]

**5.3.2. Blood culture-negative infective endocarditis**

Blood culture-negative infective endocarditis (BCNIE) refers to IE in
which no causative microorganism can be grown using the usual blood
culture methods. The frequency of BCNIE as the cause of IE is highly
variable and often poses considerable diagnostic and therapeutic dilem-­
mas. [154][,][155] Blood culture-negative IE most commonly arises as a conse-­
quence of previous antibiotic administration, underlying the importance
of performing blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy, particularly in
patients with known risk factors for IE. Withdrawal of antibiotics and
repeating blood cultures may be required in stable patients with sub-­
acute symptoms, no evidence of local or distant complications, and re-­
ceiving a very short course of antibiotics. Blood culture-negative IE can
also be caused by fungi or fastidious bacteria, notably obligatory intra-­
cellular bacteria. Isolation of these microorganisms requires culturing
on specialized media, and their growth is relatively slow. Depending
on local epidemiology, [156] systematic serological testing for *Coxiella bur-­*
*netii*, *Bartonella* spp., *Aspergillus* spp., *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, *Brucella*
spp., and *Legionella pneumophila* should be proposed, [157] followed by
specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for *Tropheryma whip-­*
*plei*, *Bartonella* spp., and fungi ( *Candida* spp., *Aspergillus* spp.) from blood
and the tissue ( *Table 9* ). [158]

In addition, 16S and 18S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequen-­
cing from tissue is routinely performed in most laboratories and may
provide a microorganism diagnosis in BCNIE. For patients with pros-­
thetic valve BCNIE, molecular imaging technique fluorescence *in situ* hy-­
bridization combined with 16S rRNA-gene PCR and sequencing
improved the conventional cultural diagnostic methods in 30% of
cases. [159] Next-generation sequencing of plasma microbial cell-free de-­
oxyribonucleic acid (DNA) may facilitate a rapid diagnosis of IE in the
future. [160]

When all microbiological assays are negative, the diagnosis of nonbacterial endocarditis should systematically be considered and assays

for antinuclear antibodies as well as antiphospholipid syndrome (APLs)
(anticardiolipin antibodies [immunoglobulin (Ig)G] and
anti-β 2 -glycoprotein 1 antibodies [IgG and IgM]) should be performed
(although these antibodies may also be present in patients with proven
IE). [161][,][162] Pathological examination of resected tissue or embolic frag-­
ments remains the gold standard for IE diagnosis. All tissue samples
that are excised during surgical valve debridement/resection must be
collected in a sterile container without fixative or culture medium.
Samples should be sent to the pathology department and the micro-­
biology laboratory for the identification of microorganisms. On histo-­
logical examination of excised valve tissue, patterns, and degrees of
inflammation will vary depending on the infecting organism. Stains for
bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi may identify the microorganisms,
and organism-specific immunohistochemical stains can be very useful
for the final diagnosis. Importantly, histopathological analysis may facili-­
tate the diagnosis of non-infectious causes of endocarditis, such as neo-­
plastic and autoimmune causes. [160]

**5.3.3. Proposed strategy for a microbiological**
**diagnostic algorithm in suspected infective**
**endocarditis**

A proposed diagnostic scheme is provided in *Figure 4* . When there is
clinical suspicion of IE and blood cultures remain negative at 48 h, con-­
sultation with the microbiologist is necessary. [156][,][160] A suggested strat-­
egy is the use of a diagnostic kit including blood cultures for the
suspected microorganism and when negative, systematic serological


testing for *C. burnetii*, *Bartonella* spp., *Aspergillus* spp., *L. pneumophila*,
*Brucella* spp., and *M. pneumoniae*, as well as rheumatoid factor, sero-­
logical tests for APLs (anticardiolipin [IgG] and anti-β 2 -glycoprotein 1

[IgG and IgM]), antinuclear antibodies, and anti-pork antibodies.
Serological testing should be performed taking into consideration the
clinical characteristics of the patients (i.e. *Aspergillus* spp. in severe im-­
munocompromised patients), the local epidemiology, and being aware
of the specificity of the tests. In addition, tissue or prosthetic material
obtained at surgery must be subjected to systematic culture, histologic-­
al examination, and 16S or 18S rRNA sequencing aimed at document-­
ing the presence of organisms.

**5.4. Imaging techniques**
Evidence of lesions characteristic of IE are major diagnostic criterion.
Echocardiography is the first-line imaging technique to diagnose IE
and to assess the structural and functional damage of cardiac struc-­
tures. Echocardiographic findings have prognostic implications, and
help to guide decision-making and patient follow-up while receiving
antibiotic therapy and during the peri-operative and post-operative
periods. [163] In some clinical scenarios, other imaging modalities, such
as CT, nuclear imaging, and MRI, are needed to confirm or exclude
the diagnosis of IE, to characterize the extent of the cardiac lesions,
and to diagnose extracardiac complications. They can also provide
additional useful information for patient management. [137] Each of
these techniques has its diagnostic strengths and weaknesses (see
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Table S2* ). The use of an optimal imaging
strategy depends on the availability of, and expertise in, each tech-­
nique, but when indicated a multimodality imaging approach is essen-­
tial for patients with suspected IE and should be strongly encouraged
by the Endocarditis Team. [21]

**5.4.1. Echocardiography**
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transoesophageal echocar-­
diography (TOE) are the first and key imaging techniques used to diag-­
nose IE. Although echocardiography is widely accessible, significant
variation in the use of TOE still exists. [164] Three-dimensional TOE

and intracardiac echocardiography have also been shown to be useful
for the diagnosis of IE and its complications. [165] However, the availability
of intracardiac echocardiography is limited. Vegetation characteristics
and size, perivalvular complications (abscess, pseudoaneurysm, new
partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve), intracardiac fistula, and leaflet
perforation are the main echocardiographic findings for the diagnosis
and evaluation of local complications of IE (see [Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)
online, *[Table S3](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)* ). Importantly, vegetation size is a key metric that guides
surgical indication, and vegetation size is defined as the maximal length
of the vegetation. [166] When evaluating IE on native or prosthetic valves,
TTE had low sensitivity but good specificity as compared with TOE. [166]

TOE is helpful in a wide range of clinical scenarios, due to limitations of
TTE to diagnose perivalvular complications, small vegetations, PVE, and
vegetations associated with CIED. TOE is strongly recommended in pa-­
tients with an inconclusive TTE, in patients with a negative TTE and a
high suspicion of IE, as well as in patients with a positive TTE, in order
to document local complications. Repeating TTE and/or TOE should be
considered during follow-up of uncomplicated IE, in order to detect
new silent complications and monitor vegetation size. The timing and
mode (TTE or TOE) of repeated examination depend on the initial
findings, type of microorganism, and initial response to therapy.

Echocardiographic imaging should be performed as soon as the IE
diagnosis is suspected. The degree of valvular damage, the rate of
peripheral embolic events, and the need for valve surgery increase
with increasing time to initial echocardiographic assessment. [167]

Echocardiography should be repeated 5–7 days after an initial
normal or inconclusive echocardiography, if the suspicion of IE re-­
mains high, and in patients with diagnosed IE at high risk of compli-­
cations (e.g. aggressive microorganisms, prosthetic
valves). [22][,][165][,][168][,][169]

There is uncertainty regarding whether echocardiography should be
systematically performed in patients with bloodstream infections due
to different bacterial species, or if there are strategies (microbiological
or imaging) that allow the identification of patients at higher risk of IE.


Scoring systems have been developed to help in the appropriate
indication to perform echocardiography when bacteraemia of different
microorganisms occurs (see Supplementary data online,
*[Table S4](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)* ). [60][,][170][–][173] The combination of microbiological parameters
(type of microorganism and number of positive blood culture bottles)
and cardiac-related risk factors (native valve disease, previous IE, pros-­
thetic valve, and cardiac devices) may help identify the patients in whom
echocardiography (TTE+TOE) is needed. [19][,][174] Three risk scores were
recently developed to identify patients at high risk of IE caused by *S. aur-­*
*eus*, and those who should be evaluated with echocardiography (see
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Section S2.2.1* ). [170][–][173][,][175][–][178] The cut-off
values of the various scores are provided in [Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)

b Level of evidence.

**5.4.2. Computed tomography**

The indications for CT in patients with suspected or diagnosed IE

include:


(i) Diagnosis of IE and cardiac complications. Cardiac CT is more ac-­

curate than TOE for diagnosing perivalvular and periprosthetic
complications of IE (abscesses, pseudoaneurysms, and fistulae)
and is recommended in both NVE and PVE if TOE is not conclusive
or not feasible. [33][,][168][,][169] In addition, cardiac CT can significantly
influence subsequent surgical decision-making. [20][,][185][,][186]

Echocardiography continues to be superior for detecting valvular
lesions, particularly small vegetations (<10 mm) which remain un-­
derdiagnosed by CT, but also leaflet perforations and fistulae (see
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Table S3* ). [35][,][168][,][169] Cardiac CT should
be acquired according to the recommendations of cardiac CT
guidelines to ensure high diagnostic accuracy, and can be per-­
formed alone or in combination with PET. [187]

(ii) Detection of distant lesions and sources of bacteraemia. Whole-body
and brain CT are useful for assessing IE systemic complications, includ-­
ing septic emboli. The detection of distant lesions adds a minor diag-­
nostic criterion leading to a more conclusive diagnosis of definite or
rejected IE, and can be relevant for decision-making. [188] CT angiog-­
raphy can detect mycotic arterial aneurysms complicating IE in almost
any site of the vascular tree, [189][,][190] including the central nervous sys-­
tem (CNS). Although MRI is superior to CT for diagnosing neuro-­
logical complications, [191] CT may be more feasible in an emergency
setting and is an acceptable alternative for the detection of neurologic-­
al complications, with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 86% in the
detection of ischaemic and haemorrhagic lesions. [192] Finally, CT can
also detect the extracardiac sources of the bacteraemia, including
early neoplastic lesions, that may be important for patient manage-­
ment, and which need to be ideally addressed prior to undergoing
heart valve surgery. However, CT does not replace the specific test
indicated for the diagnosis of the extracardiac source of bacteraemia
(i.e. colonoscopy in colon neoplasms).
(iii) Pre-operative assessment. Cardiac CT is a valuable alternative for
non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) before
cardiac surgery in patients with IE. [193]

(iv) Alternative diagnosis. In patients in whom IE is ruled out, or even in
doubtful patients with possible IE, an alternative diagnosis can be
reached by whole-body CT, as it can help to detect alternative in-­
fectious foci. However, in these circumstances, an [18]FDG posi-­
tron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is
the preferred imaging technique. [194]

**5.4.3. Magnetic resonance imaging**

The roles of MRI in the diagnostic work-up of IE include:

(i) Diagnosis of IE and cardiac complications. The role of cardiac MRI to
diagnose IE is limited by the low spatial resolution (as compared
with cardiac CT) and the signal void generated by some prostheses
impairing the assessment of prosthetic valve anatomy and
function. [195][,][196]

(ii) Diagnosis of neurological IE-related complications. MRI has higher
sensitivity than CT for the diagnosis of neurological lesions and,
hence, increases the likelihood of detecting neurological complica-­
tions in patients with IE. Patients with IE might present CNS lesions
in up to 60–80% of cases, [197] most of them corresponding to is-­
chaemic lesions (50–80% of patients) that are often small and
asymptomatic and do not impact on the decision-making. [198]

Other lesions that may influence the decision-making, such as par-­
enchymal or subarachnoid haemorrhages, abscesses, or mycotic
aneurysms, are found in <10% of patients. [198][–][201] The systematic
performance of brain MRI has shown to directly impact the

**3970** ESC Guidelines


diagnosis of IE, as it can add a minor diagnostic criterion in patients
without neurological symptoms with non-definitive IE diagnosis.
Brain MRI can reclassify 25% of patients with an initially inconclu-­
sive diagnosis for IE to a more conclusive diagnosis, thereby leading
to an earlier diagnosis. [151] Cerebral microbleeds, found in 50–60%
of patients with IE, are detected at gradient echo T2* se-­
quences. [200][,][202] Cerebral microbleeds should not be considered a

minor criterion because there is no concordance with ischaemic
lesions. [203][–][205]

(iii) Diagnosis of spine lesions. MRI is the diagnostic modality of choice
of spondylodiscitis and vertebral osteomyelitis with a diagnostic ac-­
curacy of 89–94%. MRI findings include vertebrae and disc oedema,
paravertebral/epidural inflammation or abscess, bone erosion, and
gadolinium enhancement of vertebrae and discs. [32][,][206] It should be
acknowledged that when MRI is performed too early, the rate of
false-negative increases. [207]

**5.4.4. Nuclear imaging positron emission**
**tomography/computed tomography (angiography)**
**and single photon emission tomography/computed**
**tomography**
Technical specifications of these imaging techniques are in the
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Section S2.2.2* . The roles of nuclear imaging
techniques in the diagnostic work-up of IE include:

(i) Diagnosis of IE and cardiac complications. [18F]FDG-PET/CT and white
blood cell (WBC) single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT)/CT are recommended in suspected PVE in cases of inconclu-­
sive echocardiography. The most recent meta-analysis showed 86%
sensitivity and 84% specificity for [18F]FDG-PET/CT in PVE. [129]

Additional evidence demonstrating the incremental diagnostic value
of [18F]FDG-PET/CT and WBC SPECT/CT is summarized in the
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Section S2.2.2; Table S5* . [22][,][208][–][212]

White blood cell SPECT/CT is an alternative nuclear imaging tech-­
nique for the diagnosis of IE, when PET/CT is unavailable and in-­
experienced centres. The sensitivity of WBC SPECT/CT has been
reported as 64–90% and the specificity as 36–100%; diagnostic
ability significantly increases with the presence of periprosthetic
abscesses. [213][–][215] 99m Technetium-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime
(99mTc-HMPAO)-SPECT/CT helped to reduce the number of misdiag-­
nosed IE cases classified in the ‘possible IE’ category by the modified
Duke criteria by 27%. [216]

In cases of NVE, the sensitivity of PET/CT and SPECT/CT is low
(about 31%) but with a higher specificity (around 98%). [211] In NVE,
the diagnosis of IE cannot be excluded in the absence of abnormal

[18F]FDG uptake. [217] The more frequent presence of valve vegetations
in comparison with paravalvular involvement in NVE compared with
PVE leads to reduced inflammatory response and subsequently lower

[18F]FDG and WBC uptake. The lower sensitivity of [18F]FDG-PET/
CT is offset by other strengths of the technique, such as its ability to
identify septic emboli when suspected. [211][,][218][–][220] Electrocardiogram
(ECG)-gated PET may further improve the diagnostic accuracy. [221]

Combining PET/CT acquisition with a CT angiography (PET/CTA) al-­
lows the detection of metabolic findings ([18F]FDG uptake distribution
and intensity) and anatomical findings (IE-related lesions) within a single
imaging procedure, resulting in the clinical clarification of indeterminate
findings and change in the management of the patients. [22][,][211] Such inves-­
tigations may be particularly helpful in complex settings, such as patients
with CHD [222][,][223] and/or aortic grafts. [22][,][224]


(ii) Detection of distant lesions and sources of bacteraemia.
Whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/CT imaging is particularly useful in
patients with a suspicion or proven IE to identify distant lesions,
mycotic aneurysms, and the portal of entry of the infection. [225][,][226]

Septic emboli are typically located in the spleen, lungs (in rightsided IE), and kidneys, and metastatic infections in the interverte-­
bral discs and/or the vertebral bone (spondylodiscitis) as well as
in muscles and joints (septic arthritis) and liver. [211][,][227][,][228] [18F]
FDG-PET/CT is less suited to detect cerebral septic embolism
and mycotic aneurysms of intracerebral arteries due to the high
physiological uptake of [18F]FDG in the brain.
(iii) Monitoring response to antimicrobial treatment with [18F]
FDG-PET/CT in patients with established IE and indication for sur-­
gery but who cannot be operated on due to unacceptable high risk
and remain with long-term suppressive antibiotic treat-­
ment. [137][,][184][,][229][–][236]

**5.5. Diagnostic criteria**
Since 2000, clinical, microbiological, and imaging findings have been inte-­
[grated in the modified Duke criteria (see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)
*[Table S6](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)* ), which have demonstrated an overall sensitivity of 80% for
IE. [151] However, the clinical presentation of IE can be highly variable
and some major limitations of the modified Duke criteria have become
clear, particularly when prosthetic material is present (PVE, aortic grafts,
cardiac devices, CHD). In these situations, echocardiography can be
normal or inconclusive in up to 30% of cases despite the presence of
IE. [242][–][244] Therefore, the 2015 ESC diagnostic criteria introduced a


multimodality imaging approach (echocardiography, cardiac/
whole-body CT, cerebral MRI, [18F]FDG-PET/CT, and WBC SPECT/
CT) to improve the diagnostic yield. This new approach has shown to
be superior over the traditional diagnostic criteria. [36][–][41][,][122][,][123][,][125][,][126][,][212]

The reasons to justify the changes in the diagnostic criteria include:

*5.5.1.1. Major criteria – microbiology*

*Enteroccus faecalis* should be acknowledged as a typical endocarditis
bacterium, regardless of the place of acquisition or the source of
infection. Currently, the modified Duke criteria fail to identify 30% of
*E. faecalis* definite IE. Using data from a prospective study of 344 pa-­
tients with *E. faecalis* bacteraemia evaluated with echocardiography,


Dahl *et al.* demonstrated that designating *E. faecalis* as a ‘typical’ endo-­
carditis pathogen significantly improved the sensitivity to correctly iden-­
tify definite IE, from 70% to 96%. [245]

*5.5.1.2. Major criteria – imaging*


(i) Diagnosis based on the presence of lesions characteristics of IE.
Anatomic lesions and increased [18F]FDG uptake or WBC accu-­
mulation can be depicted by nuclear imaging techniques and add

a major diagnostic criterion. Definitions of the anatomic and meta-­
bolic features of the infective lesions can be found in the

[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Table S5* .
(ii) Abnormal prosthetic or periprosthetic uptake (intense focal or
heterogeneous) detected by [18F]FDG-PET/CT or WBC
SPECT/CT should be considered a major criterion for PVE, irre-­
spective of the interval from surgery (see [Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)
online, *[Figure S1](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)* ). Published data support that intense focal or
heterogeneous patterns is associated with a final diagnosis of in-­
fection, while post-operative inflammatory changes can be per-­
sistent more than 3 months after surgery, as noted in the
previous guidelines. However, these inflammatory changes can
be differentiated from infection even after recent valve implant-­
ation. [246] Therefore, a consensus of experts has concluded that
the need for a time interval prior to investigation is questionable,


but accurate imaging interpretation by proper interpretation cri-­
teria is mandatory. [233][,][236]

*5.5.1.3. Minor criteria*

Distant IE-related lesions include all lesions that can result from embolic

events and from haematogenous seeding of bacteria. These lesions can
be suspected due to specific symptoms or can be incidentally detected
on imaging techniques. Spondylodiscitis is the most frequent osteoarti-­
cular infective complication in patients with IE. [247][,][248]


*5.5.1.4. Microbiological criteria*

Molecular biology (16S/18S rRNA PCR sequencing) in cardiac tissue or
embolic material has increased the diagnostic performance of IE with
negative blood culture. The sensitivity ranges between 41% and 96%
and the specificity is very high, ranging between 90% and 100%. [249]

ESC Guidelines **3975**


*5.5.1.5. Infective endocarditis classification*
Infective endocarditis classification has been added to the 2023 ESC cri-­
teria. Possible IE cases include the combination of 1 major and 1 or 2
minor criteria. Infective endocarditis classification should be applied
by the Endocarditis Team at admission and later at follow-up, taking
into account the complete clinical, microbiology, imaging, and surgical
information to establish the final diagnosis.

It is important to acknowledge that these new criteria should be pro-­
spectively validated.

**5.5.2. The new 2023 European Society of Cardiology**
**diagnostic algorithms**
The diagnosis of IE is based on clinical suspicion, blood cultures, and im-­
aging findings. Echocardiography is usually the first imaging technique to
diagnose IE, although the use of other techniques, either for the diagno-­
sis of cardiac involvement (cardiac CT, [18F]FDG-PET/CT, or WBC
SPECT/CT), or for the diagnosis of distant lesions (cerebral MRI, wholebody CT, and/or PET/CT), is encouraged. In the presence of prosthetic
valves and CIED, echocardiography is particularly limited and the afore-­
mentioned imaging techniques are strongly recommended. Adapted
diagnostic algorithms for suspected IE in NVE, PVE, and CIED are dis-­
played in *Figures 5–7*, respectively.
#### **6. Prognostic assessment at ** **admission**

The in-hospital mortality rate of patients with IE has remained largely
unchanged over the past two decades, ranging from 15% to
30%. [5][,][145][,][250][,][251] Several patient characteristics, often occurring simul-­
taneously, have been shown to confer an increased risk of death in
IE. The rapid identification of patients at the highest risk may offer
the opportunity to change the course of the disease (i.e. with urgent
or emergency surgery) and improve prognosis. Predictors of poor out-­
come on admission of patients with IE are specified in the
[Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Section S3.1; Table S7* .
#### **7. Antimicrobial therapy: principles ** **and methods**

**7.1. General principles**
Successful treatment of IE relies on microbial eradication by antimicro-­
bial drugs. Surgery contributes by removing infected material.
Bactericidal regimens are more effective than bacteriostatic therapy,
both in animal experiments and in humans. [252][–][254] Aminoglycosides sy-­
nergize with cell wall inhibitors (i.e. beta-lactams and glycopeptides) for
bactericidal activity and are useful for shortening the duration of ther-­
apy (e.g. oral streptococci) and eradicating problematic organisms.
However, the side effects of aminoglycosides should be taken into con-­
sideration and currently the combination of ampicillin with ceftriaxone
has demonstrated effective in treating IE caused by *E. faecalis* irrespect-­
ive of the presence of high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) and
minimizing the risk of nephrotoxicity. [255][,][256]

One major hindrance to drug-induced killing is bacterial antibiotic
tolerance. Tolerant microbes are not resistant (i.e. they are still suscep-­
tible to growth inhibition by the drug) but escape drug-induced killing
and may resume growth after treatment discontinuation.
Slow-growing and dormant microbes display phenotypic tolerance


towards most antimicrobials (except rifampin to some extent). They
are present in vegetations and biofilms (complex communities of bac-­
teria residing within an exopolysaccharide matrix that adheres to a sur-­
face, e.g. in PVE), [257] and justify the need for prolonged therapy to fully
sterilize infected heart valves. Some bacteria carry mutations rendering
them tolerant during both active growth and stationary (dormant)
phases. [258][,][259] Bactericidal drug combinations are preferred to mono-­
therapy against tolerant organisms (e.g. the combination of ampicillin
and ceftriaxone in IE caused by *E. faecalis* ).

Drug treatment of PVE should last longer (≥6 weeks) than that of
NVE (2–6 weeks) but is otherwise similar. In staphylococcal PVE, the
regimen should include rifampin whenever the strain is susceptible,
even if some recent data have shown no differences in outcomes be-­
tween patients with PVE treated with rifampin vs. those treated
without. [260][,][261]

In NVE needing valve replacement by a prosthesis during antibiotic
therapy, the post-operative antibiotic regimen should be that recom-­
mended for NVE, not for PVE. In both NVE and PVE, the duration of
treatment is based on the first day of effective antibiotic therapy (nega-­
tive blood culture in the case of initial positive blood culture), not on the
day of surgery. A new full course of treatment should only start if valve
cultures are positive.

Finally, there are important considerations in these

recommendations:

(i) Only published antibiotic efficacy data from clinical trials and cohort
studies in patients with IE (or bacteraemia if there are no IE data)
have been considered in these guidelines. Data from experimental
IE models have not been taken into account. A recent systematic
review evaluating the existing evidence about clinical benefits and
harms of different antibiotic regimens used to treat patients with
IE has shown that there is limited and low- to very low-quality evi-­
dence to make strong conclusions on the comparative effects of dif-­
ferent antibiotic regimens on cure rates or other relevant clinical
outcomes and, therefore, there is not enough evidence to support
or reject any regimen of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of
IE. [262][,][263]

(ii) These guidelines have adopted the MIC breakpoints included in the
2022 EUCAST clinical breakpoint tables. [42] The EUCAST break-­
points are used to categorize results into three susceptibility
categories:

  - Susceptible, standard dosing regimen: a microorganism is cate-­

gorized as such, when there is a high likelihood of therapeutic
success using a standard dosing regimen of the agent.

  - Susceptible, increased exposure: a microorganism is categorized
as such when there is a high likelihood of therapeutic success be-­
cause exposure to the agent is increased by adjusting the dosing
regimen or by its concentration at the site of infection.

   - Resistant: a microorganism is categorized as such when there is a
high likelihood of therapeutic failure even when there is in-­
creased exposure.

The term exposure is defined as a function of how the mode of ad-­
ministration, dose, dosing interval, infusion time, as well as distribution
and excretion of the antimicrobial agent, will influence the infecting or-­
ganism at the site of infection. The local laboratories are responsible for
the use of appropriate methods and interpretative criteria and quality
control of the test results (MIC) while the clinicians are responsible
for adjusting the level of exposure by modifying the dosing strategy

**3976** ESC Guidelines


(individual dose, frequency of dosing, mode of administration [oral or
intravenous (i.v.)]). [42]

(iii) Oral antimicrobial therapy. The POET trial has changed the para-­

digm of i.v. antibiotic treatment for IE. [43] For more than 60 years it
had been considered that antibiotics should always be given intra-­
venously. The POET trial has shown that after an initial phase of
i.v. treatment, up to 20% of patients could complete the treatment
by oral antibiotic therapy (see *Section 7.13.1* ). [43] Therefore, as indi-­
cated in *Figure 8*, the antibiotic treatment of IE has two phases.
The first phase can last up to 2 weeks of hospital i.v. treatment using
combinations of rapidly bactericidal antibiotics to destroy planktonic
bacteria. [257] In this initial phase, cardiac surgery should be performed
if indicated, infected foreign bodies should be removed, and cardiac
as well as extracardiac abscesses should be drained. After this peri-­
od, clinically stable patients can end the antibiotic treatment at home
with i.v. (OPAT) or oral antibiotic regimens for up to 6 weeks in or-­
der to eliminate the dormant (resting) bacteria and prevent relapses.
(iv) Aminoglycosides are not recommended in staphylococcal NVE be-­

cause their clinical benefits have not been demonstrated, but they


can increase renal toxicity. [255][,][264] When they are indicated in other
conditions (e.g. resistant oral streptococci), [265] aminoglycosides should
be given for no longer than 2 weeks to reduce nephrotoxicity. [266]

(v) Rifampin should be used only in foreign body infections such as PVE after
3–5 days of effective antibiotic therapy, once the bacteraemia has been
cleared. The rationale supporting this recommendation is based on the
likely antagonistic effect of the antibiotic combinations with rifampin
against planktonic/replicating bacteria, [267] and the synergy seen against
dormant bacteria within the biofilms and prevention of rifampinresistant variants. [268] New evidence based on a small, retrospective study
has questioned this approach and needs further validation. [260]

(vi) Daptomycin has been recommended for treating staphylococcal
and enterococcal endocarditis. [269] When daptomycin is indicated,
it must be given at high doses (10 mg/kg once daily) [270] and
combined with a second antibiotic (beta-lactams or fosfomycin in
beta-lactam allergic patients) to increase activity and avoid the de-­
velopment of resistance. [271] It should be noted the use of fosfomycin

is associated with increased risk of acute HF and renal failure due to

the high load of sodium while the use of daptomycin has been asso-­
ciated with eosinophilic syndromes in up to 15% of patients. [272][,][273]

ESC Guidelines **3977**


(vii) The antibiotic regimens need to adapt to the local circumstances
and the availability of antibiotics.
(viii) Data on the efficacy of long-term antibiotic suppressive therapy in pa-­

tients with IE who do not undergo cardiac surgery are limited to small
and heterogeneous series with various antibiotic regimens. [184][,][274] In a
small series of Gram-positive bloodstream infections and IE, dalba-­
vancin (500 mg weekly or 1000 mg biweekly regimens) has been
shown effective. [274][,][275] Relapses are not infrequent. [184]

**7.2. Penicillin-susceptible oral streptococci**
**and** ***Streptococcus gallolyticus*** **group**
Oral streptococci include the groups *mitis*, *sanguinis*, *anginosus*, *salivar-­*
*ius*, *downei*, and *mutans* [(see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Figure S2* ). [276]

The remaining streptococci isolated outside of the oral cavity are clas-­
sified into either the *Streptococcus gallolyticus* (former bovis) or pyogen-­
ic groups. Recommended regimens against susceptible (susceptible
standard dosing regimen and increased exposure) streptococci are
summarized in Recommendation Table 7. [4][,][277][–][279] The cure rate is ex-­
pected to be >95%. In uncomplicated cases of NVE, short-term 2-week
therapy can be administered by combining penicillin or ceftriaxone with
gentamicin or netilmicin. [280][,][281] Gentamicin and netilmicin can be given
once daily in patients with IE due to susceptible streptococci and nor-­
mal renal function. When outpatient antibiotic therapy is feasible, cef-­
triaxone alone or combined with gentamicin or netilmicin given once a
day is particularly convenient. [280][–][282] In patients with documented al-­
lergy to penicillin, desensitization is recommended. If desensitization
cannot be performed, patients allergic to beta-lactam should receive


cephalosporins (in non-anaphylactic reaction) or vancomycin, keeping
in mind that a beta-lactam is superior to glycopeptides. Teicoplanin
has been proposed as an alternative, [4] starting with loading doses
(6 mg/kg/12 h for 3 days) and followed by 6–10 mg/kg/day. Loading is
critical because the drug is highly bound (≥98%) to serum proteins
and penetrates slowly into vegetations. [283] However, only limited retro-­
spective studies have assessed its efficacy in streptococcal IE. [284] After
10–14 days of therapy, OPAT or outpatient oral antibiotic therapy

should be considered.

**7.3. Oral streptococci and**
***Streptococcus gallolyticus*** **group**
**susceptible, increased exposure or**
**resistant to penicillin**
The incidence of these resistant streptococci is increasing. Large strain
collections have reported >30% of resistant *S. mitis* and *Streptococcus*
*oralis* . [285]

Retrospective series provide the evidence for the recommendations
on antibiotic treatment of IE caused by penicillin-resistant oral strepto-­
cocci and *S. gallolyticus* . Compiling four of them, 47 of 60 patients (78%)
were treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone, mostly combined with ami-­
noglycosides. [285][–][290] In penicillin-resistant cases, aminoglycoside treat-­
ment must be given for ≥2 weeks and short-term therapy regimens
are not recommended. There is very limited experience with daptomy-­
cin in IE caused by resistant isolates. [265][,][291] After 10–14 days of therapy,
OPAT or outpatient oral antibiotic therapy should be considered if clin-­
ically stable (see *Section 7.13* ).

c The starting recommended doses are the lower doses which can be scalable to the highest doses.

given in a single daily dose, pre-dose (trough) concentrations should be <1 mg/L and post-dose (peak; 1 h after injection) serum concentrations should be ∼10–12 mg/L.
e Serum vancomycin concentrations should achieve 10–15 mg/L at pre-dose (trough) level, although some experts recommend to increase the dose of vancomycin to 45–60 mg/kg/day i.v. in 2
or 3 divided doses to reach serum trough vancomycin levels (C min ) of 15–20 mg/L as in staphylococcal endocarditis. However, vancomycin dose should not exceed 2 g/day unless serum levels
are monitored and can be adjusted to obtain a peak plasma concentration of 30–45 μg/mL 1 h after completion of the i.v. infusion of the antibiotic.

ESC Guidelines **3979**


**7.4.** ***Streptococcus pneumoniae*** **,**
**β-haemolytic streptococci**
**(groups A, B, C, and G)**
Infective endocarditis due to *Streptococcus pneumoniae* has become
rare. It is associated with meningitis and pneumonia in up to 30% of
cases, [293][–][296] which requires special consideration in cases with penicil-­
lin resistance. Treatment of penicillin-susceptible strains is similar to
that of oral streptococci (see Recommendation Table 7), except for
the use of short-term 2-week therapy, which has not been thoroughly
investigated. The same holds true for penicillin-susceptible increased
exposure or resistant strains without meningitis, although for resistant
strains some authors recommend high doses of cephalosporins (e.g.
cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) or vancomycin. [295] In cases with meningitis,
penicillin must be avoided because of its poor penetration into the
cerebrospinal fluid, and should be replaced with ceftriaxone or cefotax-­
ime alone, or in association with vancomycin according to the antibiotic
susceptibility pattern. [297][,][298] After 10–14 days of therapy and when
meningitis is not associated, OPAT or outpatient oral antibiotic therapy
should be considered if clinically stable (see *Section 7.13* ).

Infective endocarditis due to group A, B, C, or G streptococci, includ-­
ing the *Streptococcus anginosus* group ( *S. constellatus*, *S. anginosus*, and *S.*
*intermedius* ) is relatively rare. [299][,][300] Group A streptococci are uniformly
susceptible to beta-lactams, whereas other serogroups may display
some degree of resistance. Infective endocarditis due to group B
streptococci was once associated with the peripartum period, but it
now occurs in all adults, especially the elderly. Groups B, C, and G
streptococci and *S. anginosus* induce abscesses that require adjunctive
surgery. [300] Mortality from group B PVE is very high and cardiac surgery
is recommended. [301] Antibiotic treatment is similar to that of oral

streptococci (see Recommendation Table 7), except that short-term
(2 weeks) therapy is not recommended and gentamicin should be given

for 2 weeks.

**7.5.** ***Granulicatella*** **and** ***Abiotrophia***
**(formerly nutritionally variant**
**streptococci)**
*Granulicatella* and *Abiotrophia* induce IE with a prolonged course and are
associated with large vegetations (>10 mm), and consequently with
high rates of complications and valve replacement (around
50%). [302][,][303] This is possibly due to delayed diagnosis and treatment.
Antibiotic recommendations include penicillin G, ceftriaxone, or vanco-­
mycin for 6 weeks, combined with an aminoglycoside for at least the
first 2 weeks in case of PVE (for doses, please see Recommendation
Table 7). [302][–][304]

**7.6.** ***Staphylococcus aureus*** **and**
**coagulase-negative staphylococci**
*Staphylococcus aureus* is usually responsible for acute and destructive
IE, [305] whereas CoNS can induce more protracted valve infec-­
tions. [306][,][307] Of note, the addition of an aminoglycoside in staphylococ-­
cal NVE is no longer recommended because it increases renal
toxicity. [264][,][308] Short-term (2-week) and oral treatments have been
proposed for uncomplicated right-sided native valve methicillinsusceptible *S. aureus* (MSSA) IE (see also *Section 12.4.2* ), but these regi-­
mens cannot be applied to left-sided IE. For penicillin-allergic patients
with MSSA IE, penicillin desensitization can be attempted in stable pa-­
tients or cefazolin can be used since vancomycin is inferior to betalactams. [309] If beta-lactams cannot be given, where available, daptomycin


should be chosen and given in combination with another effective anti-­
staphylococcal drug to increase activity and avoid the development of
resistance. [310] *Staphylococcus lugdunensis* is mostly methicillinsusceptible and can be treated with cloxacillin.

*Staphylococcus aureus* PVE carries a very high risk of mortality
(>45%), [305][,][312][,][313] and often requires early valve replacement. Other
differences in comparison with NVE include the overall duration of ther-­
apy, the use of aminoglycosides, and the addition of rifampin after 3–5
days of effective antibiotic therapy once the bacteraemia has been
cleared. [264][,][314][–][318] The rationale supporting this recommendation is based
on the antagonistic effect of the antibiotic combinations with rifampin
against planktonic/replicating bacteria as has been demonstrated in foreign
body infection models and clinically in prosthetic orthopaedic and vascular
infections. [319] However, a recent study has shown that the addition of ami-­
noglycosides to a regimen containing vancomycin or cloxacillin plus rifam-­
picin in *S. aureus* PVE was not associated with a better outcome. [320] In
addition, the risk of nephrotoxicity associated with the use of aminoglyco-­
sides should be taken into consideration. Adding rifampin to the treatment
of staphylococcal PVE is standard practice despite the weak evi-­
dence. [261][,][321] The potential side effects and drug interactions of rifampin
should also be considered. In patients with PVE who are allergic to penicil-­
lin, daptomycin can be given combined with ceftaroline or fosfomycin or
with gentamicin (for 2 weeks) plus rifampin for at least 6 weeks. After
10–14 days of therapy, OPAT or outpatient oral antibiotic therapy should
be considered if clinically stable (see *Section 7.13* ).

**7.7. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci**
Methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA) produces low-affinity penicillinbinding proteins (PBPs), which confer cross-resistance to most betalactams. Methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* is usually resistant to multiple
antibiotics, leaving vancomycin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and dalbavan-­
cin to treat severe infections. [322][–][324] However, it should be noted

that subpopulations susceptible with increased exposure and resistant
to vancomycin have emerged worldwide and are associated with IE
treatment failures. [325][–][328] The prevalence of MRSA causing IE that is
susceptible with increased exposure or resistant to vancomycin ranges
between 19% and 34%. In addition, among patients with IE caused by
MRSA, those isolates with a population analysis profile MIC ≥4 mg/L
were associated with treatment failure defined by persistent bacteriae-­
mia for ≥7 days or MRSA-attributable mortality. [325] Nephrotoxicity is
of concern when using trough monitoring of levels of vancomycin as
a surrogate marker of the area under the curve relative to the MIC
(AUC/MIC). Therefore, it is recommended to use a target of AUC/
MIC between 400 and 600 mg*h/L (assuming an MIC of 1 mg/L) that
should be achieved with 48 h of therapy. [329] When the MIC is >1 mg/
L, the probability of achieving an AUC/MIC ≥400 is unlikely. In that clin-­
ical scenario, changing therapy should be considered due to the high risk
of nephrotoxicity with higher doses of vancomycin. Daptomycin is a li-­
popeptide antibiotic approved for *S. aureus* bacteraemia and right-sided
IE. [330] Cohort studies of *S. aureus* and CoNS IE have shown that dapto-­
mycin is at least as effective as vancomycin, [327][,][328] and, in two cohort
studies of MRSA bacteraemia with high vancomycin MICs (>1 mg/
L), [331][,][332] daptomycin was associated with better outcomes (including
survival) compared with vancomycin. Importantly, daptomycin needs
to be administered in appropriate doses and combined with other anti-­
biotics to avoid further resistance in patients with IE. [330][,][333] Therefore,
daptomycin should be given at high doses (10 mg/kg), and most experts
recommend its combination with beta-lactams [334] or fosfomycin [335]

(beta-lactams [and probably fosfomycin] increase membrane

daptomycin binding by decreasing the positive surface charge) for NVE,
and with gentamicin and rifampin for PVE. [326][–][328] However, in a rando-­
mized trial including 352 patients with MRSA bacteraemia, daptomycin
or vancomycin combined with i.v. flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin
did not result in a significant reduction of the primary composite end-­
point of mortality, persistent bacteraemia, relapse, or treatment failure
as compared with daptomycin or vancomycin alone. [328] The study was
stopped prematurely before recruiting the target number of patients
( *n* = 440) due to increased incidence of acute kidney injury in the


combination therapy arm and, therefore, the results should be inter-­
preted with caution.

Other alternatives include fosfomycin plus imipenem, [336] ceftaroline, [337]

quinupristin–dalfopristin with or without beta-lactams, [338][,][339] beta-lactams
plus oxazolidinones (linezolid), [340] beta-lactams plus vancomycin, [341] and
high doses of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin. [342][,][343]

These clinical and therapeutic scenarios warrant collaborative manage-­
ment with the Endocarditis Team including an infectious disease specialist,
since the evidence is based on very small populations.

c Cloxacillin is not recommended if the patient has penicillin allergy.
d Maximum doses 240 mg/day. High doses are associated with increased risk of nephrotoxicity. Renal function and serum gentamicin concentrations should be monitored once a week. When
given in a single daily dose, pre-dose (trough) concentrations should be <1 mg/L and post-dose (peak; 1 h after injection) serum concentrations should be ∼10–12 mg/L.
e Cefazolin can replace cloxacillin only in patients with non–immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin.

penicillin.
g In patients with heart failure, the high load of sodium associated with the use of fosfomycin can lead to acute heart failure.
h Serum vancomycin concentrations should achieve 10–15 mg/L at pre-dose (trough) level, although some experts recommend to increase the dose of vancomycin to 45–60 mg/kg/day i.v. in 2
or 3 divided doses to reach serum trough vancomycin levels (Cmin) of 15–20 mg/L as in staphylococcal endocarditis. However, vancomycin dose should not exceed 2 g/d unless serum levels
are monitored and can be adjusted to obtain a peak plasma concentration of 30–45 μg/mL 1 h after completion of the i.v. infusion of the antibiotic.

**3982** ESC Guidelines


**7.8.** ***Enterococcus*** **spp.**
Enterococcal IE is primarily caused by *E. faecalis* (90% of cases) and less
often by *Enterococcus faecium* (5% of cases), or other species. [350]

Enterococcal IE poses two major problems. First, enterococci are highly
resistant to antibiotic-induced killing, and eradication requires pro-­
longed administration (up to 6 weeks) of synergistic bactericidal com-­
binations of two cell wall inhibitors (ampicillin plus ceftriaxone, which
synergize by inhibiting complementary PBPs), or one cell wall inhibitor
with aminoglycosides. [351][–][353] Second, they may be resistant to multiple
drugs, including aminoglycosides (HLAR), beta-lactams (via PBP 5 modi-­
fication and sometimes beta-lactamases), and vancomycin. [351][–][357]

Penicillin-susceptible strains are treated with penicillin G or ampicillin
(or amoxicillin) combined with gentamicin. However, ampicillin (or
amoxicillin) is preferred since the MIC is two to four times lower than
that of penicillin G. Gentamicin resistance is frequent in both *E. faecalis*
and *E. faecium* (up to 75%). [358][,][359] An aminoglycoside MIC >128 mg/L
(HLAR) is associated with the loss of bactericidal synergism with cell
wall inhibitors, and aminoglycosides should not be used in such conditions.

There have been two important advances in recent years. First, in sev-­
eral cohort studies of *E. faecalis* IE including hundreds of cases, it was ob-­
served that ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is as effective as ampicillin plus
gentamicin for non-HLAR *E. faecalis* IE. The combination of ampicillin


plus ceftriaxone was also associated with a beneficial safety profile,
due to the lack of nephrotoxicity. [355][,][360][,][361] Therefore, this is the com-­
bination of choice for treating NVE and PVE caused by HLAR *E. faecalis* .
This double beta-lactam therapy is not effective against *E. faecium* and
the experience in the treatment of other enterococcal species is very
limited. Second, the total daily dose of gentamicin can be given in a single
daily dose instead of the 2 or 3 divided doses previously recommended,
and the length of the treatment with gentamicin for non-HLAR *E. faeca-­*
*lis* IE may be safely shortened from 4–6 weeks to 2 weeks, reducing the
rates of nephrotoxicity to very low levels. [266][,][362][,][363] After 10–14 days of
therapy, OPAT or outpatient oral antibiotic therapy should be consid-­
ered if the patient is clinically stable (see *Section 7.13* ). [364][–][367]

Beta-lactam or vancomycin resistance is mainly observed in *E. fae-­*
*cium* . Since dual resistance is rare, beta-lactam might be used against
vancomycin-resistant strains and vice versa. Varying results have been
reported with quinupristin–dalfopristin (not active against *E. faecalis* ),
linezolid, daptomycin, teicoplanin, and tigecycline. [353][,][365][,][368]

Daptomycin 10–12 mg/kg/24 h, always combined with beta-lactams
(ampicillin, ertapenem, or ceftaroline) or fosfomycin in order to
prevent the development of daptomycin resistance, is the best
option for treating multidrug- and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal
IE. [369]

*Haemophilus*, *Aggregatibacter* (previously *Actinobacillus* ), *Cardiobacterium*,
*Eikenella*, and *Kingella* (HACEK) Gram-negative bacilli are fastidious organ-­
isms that require special investigations when they are the suspected cause
of IE (see also *Section 5* ). Because they grow slowly, standard MIC tests may


be difficult to interpret. Some HACEK group bacilli produce betalactamases, and therefore ampicillin is no longer the first-line option.
Conversely, they are susceptible to ceftriaxone, other third-generation ce-­
phalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. The standard treatment is ceftriaxone

2 g/day for 4 weeks in NVE and for 6 weeks in PVE. If they do not produce

beta-lactamase, ampicillin (12 g/day i.v. in 4 or 6 doses) for 4–6 weeks plus

gentamicin (3 mg/kg/day divided into 2 or 3 doses) for 2 weeks is an

**3984** ESC Guidelines


option. [370] Ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 8–12 h i.v. or 750 mg every 12 h
orally) is a less well-validated alternative. [370][–][373]

**7.9.2.** ***Non-Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter,***
***Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella*** **species**

The ICE cohort reported non-HACEK Gram-negative bacteria in 49 of
2761 (1.8%) IE cases. [279][,][374] Recommended treatment is early surgery
plus prolonged (6 weeks) therapy with bactericidal combinations of
beta-lactams and aminoglycosides, sometimes with additional quino-­
lones or cotrimoxazole. [375][,][376] *In vitro* bactericidal tests and monitoring
of serum antibiotic concentrations may be helpful. Because of their rar-­
ity and severity, these conditions should be discussed by the

Endocarditis Team.

a Owing to the lack of large series, the optimal duration of treatment of IE due to these
pathogens is unknown. The presented durations are based on selected case reports.
Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended.
b Addition of streptomycin (15 mg/kg/24 h in 2 doses) for the first few weeks is optional.
c Doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine (with monitoring of serum hydroxychloroquine
levels) is significantly superior to doxycycline. [385]

d Several therapeutic regimens have been reported, including ampicillin or amoxicillin, (12 g/
24 h i.v.) or cephalosporins (ceftriaxone 2 g/24 h i.v.) combined with aminoglycosides
(gentamicin or netilmicin). [381] Dosages are as for streptococcal and enterococcal IE. [379][,][380]

e Newer fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) are more potent than ciprofloxacin
against intracellular pathogens such as *Mycoplasma* spp., *Legionella* spp., and *Chlamydia* spp.
f Treatment of Whipple’s IE remains highly empirical. In the case of central nervous system
involvement, sulfadiazine 1.5 g/6 h orally must be added to doxycycline. An alternative
therapy is ceftriaxone (2 g/24 h i.v.) for 2–4 weeks or penicillin G (2 million U/4 h) and
streptomycin (1 g/24 h) i.v. for 2–4 weeks followed by cotrimoxazole (800 mg/12 h)
orally. Trimethoprim is not active against *T. whipplei* . Successes have been reported with
long-term therapy (1 year).

**endocarditis**

The main causes of BCNIE are summarized in *Section 5.3.2* . [377][,][378]

Treatment options are summarized in *Table 11* . [379][–][383] Treatment of
Whipple’s IE remains highly empirical. Successes have been reported
with long-term therapy (>1 year). [384] In cases of CNS involvement,
sulfadiazine 1.5 g/6 h orally must be added to doxycycline. An alterna-­
tive therapy is ceftriaxone (2 g/24 h i.v.) for 2–4 weeks or penicillin G (2
million U/4 h) and streptomycin (1 g/24 h) i.v. for 2–4 weeks followed
by cotrimoxazole (800 mg/12 h) orally. Trimethoprim is not active
against *T. whipplei* . Consultation with the Endocarditis Team, including
an infectious disease specialist, is recommended.

**7.11. Fungi**
Fungi are most frequently observed in PVE and in IE affecting PWID or
immunocompromised patients. [386] *Candida* and *Aspergillus* spp. predom-­
inate, the latter resulting in BCNIE. [387][,][388] Mortality is very high (>50%),
and treatment necessitates combined antifungal administration and with a
low threshold for surgery. [278][,][387][,][388] Antifungal therapy for *Candida* IE in-­
cludes an echinocandin at high doses or liposomal amphotericin B (or other
lipid formulations) with or without flucytosine. for *Aspergillus* IE, voricon-­
azole is the drug of choice. Some experts recommend the addition of an
echinocandin or amphotericin B. [278][,][387][–][390] Suppressive long-term treat-­
ment with oral azoles (fluconazole and voriconazole) is recommended,
sometimes lifelong. [278][,][388][,][389] Consultation with the Endocarditis Team in-­
cluding an infectious disease specialist is recommended.

**7.12. Empirical therapy**
Treatment of IE should be started promptly. Three sets of blood cultures
should be drawn at 30-minute intervals before initiation of antibiotics. [391]

The initial choice of empirical treatment depends on several

considerations:

(i) Previous antibiotic therapy.
(ii) IE in a native valve or a prosthesis (and if so, when surgery was per-­

formed [early vs. late PVE]).
(iii) The place of the infection (community, nosocomial, or nonnosocomial healthcare-associated IE) and knowledge of the local
epidemiology, especially for antibiotic resistance and specific genu-­
ine culture-negative pathogens.
(iv) Cloxacillin/cefazolin administration is associated with lower mortality
rates than other beta-lactams, including amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or
ampicillin/sulbactam, [392] and vancomycin for empirically treating
MSSA bacteraemia/endocarditis. [309][,][393] However, recently amoxicil-­
lin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin/sulbactam might be an effective empir-­
ical treatment for MSSA bacteraemia when de-escalated to cloxacillin
or cefazolin within 96 h from the index blood culture. [394]

Native valve endocarditis and late PVE regimens should cover
staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci. If the patient was receiv-­
ing antibiotic therapy, the empirical therapy should include different
antibiotics. CoNS should be empirically covered in PVE but not in
NVE. Early PVE or healthcare-associated IE regimens should cover
methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and, ideally,
non-HACEK Gram-negative pathogens. Once the pathogen is identi-­
fied (usually within 24 h), the antibiotic treatment must be adapted
to its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. It should be emphasized
that the empirical treatment should be changed to targeted therapy
once the organism is identified within 24–48 h.

e Serum vancomycin concentrations should achieve 10–15 mg/L at pre-dose (trough)
level, although some experts recommend to increase the dose of vancomycin to
45–60 mg/kg/day i.v. in 2 or 3 divided doses to reach serum trough vancomycin levels
(C min ) of 15–20 mg/L as in staphylococcal endocarditis. However, vancomycin dose
should not exceed 2 g/d unless serum levels are monitored and can be adjusted to
obtain a peak plasma concentration of 30–45 μg/mL 1 h after completion of the i.v.

infusion of the antibiotic.

**7.13. Outpatient parenteral or oral**
**antibiotic therapy for infective**
**endocarditis**

Outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment or step-down outpatient oral
antibiotic treatment is used to consolidate antimicrobial therapy once crit-­
ical infection-related complications are under control (e.g. perivalvular ab-­
scesses, acute HF, septic emboli, and stroke) and the patient is clinically
stable. [43][,][396][–][399] When feasible, early hospital discharge and OPAT helps
to alleviate the effects of infection and prolonged hospitalization especially
in the elderly. [400] In the initial phase of IE treatment, standard i.v. treatment
is administered according to recommendations for specific microorgan-­
isms. Once the clinical condition of the patient is stable, OPAT or stepdown outpatient oral antibiotic treatment is a safe alternative to in-hospital
i.v. treatment in selected patients. [43][,][399] Patients may reach such stability at
various points in their disease course but, when criteria for stability are
reached, the patient may then be switched to OPAT or alternatively to
an oral therapy at hospital discharge. The OPAT regime consists of the
same antibiotic combinations administered in the acute phase if possible.
The 5-year outcomes from the POET trial showed continued effectiveness
of oral antibiotic therapy as compared with i.v. antibiotic therapy for IE in
selected patients. [401] Hence, clinical stability will then differentiate IE
courses into two phases:

(i) Critical phase where at least 10 days of i.v. treatment is required: at
this time point, OPAT has a restricted indication.
(ii) Continuation phase (beyond 10 days of therapy and 7 days
post-surgery), where OPAT/step-down oral therapy may be feasible.

[Supplementary data online, Table S8 summarizes the salient ques-­](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)
tions to address when considering OPAT/step-down oral therapy for IE.

In addition to the patient being medically stable, general considerations
for suitability for OPAT include assessment of the patient’s home environ-­
ment and self-care capabilities. Adherence to treatment and follow-up vis-­
its are also crucial for a beneficial outcome of outpatient treatment and the
healthcare provider–patient relationship is important for ensuring proper

and continued treatment and maintenance of infection control.

**7.13.1. Parenteral and oral step-down antibiotic**

**treatment**

Stability criteria are essential and timing in the clinical planning the pa-­
tient’s course, especially TOE, becomes key ( *Figure 9* ). Stability criteria
include blood samples, clinical parameters, and TOE. [43]

OPAT has been shown to be a safe treatment in IE for stable patients

who are suitable for home treatment.

The patient, and preferably also a caregiver, should be educated care-­
fully in the disease and how to monitor/observe for signs of infection,


including daily temperature and other signs of disease progression or
complications. In addition, regular post-discharge evaluation is required
(nurse once per day, responsible physician 1–3 times per week). For pa-­
tients receiving OPAT, regular i.v. catheter inspection and care by a
healthcare professional should be provided. If the patient is not suffi-­
ciently able to self-monitor, and has no close caregivers, added surveil-­
lance is required by involved staff and home treatment should generally
be carefully considered in such cases.

Certain combinations of two oral antibiotics should be used for oral

[step-down treatment (see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Table S9* ).

**7.13.2. Other considerations for outpatient oral or**
**parenteral antimicrobial therapy**

In the OPAT programme, patients continue with the same antibiotics
that are administered in the acute phase in once-daily regimens, or
with infusion pumps if antibiotics should be administered intermittently,

or in continuous infusion. Dalbavancin is a glycopeptide antibiotic with a
very long half-life that can be administered weekly. There is previous
positive experience in sensitive Gram-positive IE, although the most ef-­
fective administration schedule is not clear. [274][,][402] The recommended

prescription is 1.5 g as a loading dose followed by 0.5–1 g weekly until
completing 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment.

Although the evidence is weak, another option (in addition to the
combinations listed in the [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data) *Table S9* ) for
staphylococcal IE is the combination of i.v. cotrimoxazole (sulfameth-­
oxazole 4800 mg/day and trimethoprim 960 mg/day in 4–6 doses)
plus i.v. clindamycin (1800 mg/day in 3 doses) during the first week fol-­
lowed by only oral cotrimoxazole for 5 weeks. [343]

#### **8. Indications for surgery and ** **management of main infective ** **endocarditis complications**

Infective endocarditis is associated with certain risks and complications
that can only be controlled with surgical intervention. Despite the risks
of surgery in these patients, current evidence suggests that surgical
treatment may generate a survival advantage of up to 20% in the first
year. [403][,][404] There are three main reasons to undergo surgery in the set-­
ting of acute IE: HF, uncontrolled infection, and prevention of septic
embolization (in particular, to the CNS) ( *Figure 10* ).


A significant proportion of surgical procedures for IE are performed
on an urgent basis. The Task Force has defined urgent surgery as that
requiring intervention within 3–5 days, although unnecessary delays
should be avoided once the indication for urgent surgery is established.
Some cases require emergency surgery (within 24 h), irrespective of
the pre-operative duration of antibiotic treatment. A third group re-­
quires surgery non-urgently, i.e. within the same hospital admission.
In cases where the infective component can be completely healed
with antibiotic treatment alone, both timing and indications for treat-­
ment of residual valve dysfunction follow the conventional guidelines
for valve treatment. [128]

**8.1. Pre-operative risk assessment**
The risk of surgical therapy during the active phase of IE can be signifi-­
cant. It is heavily influenced by pre-existing co-morbidities and current
organ function, but should not be limited by one risk factor alone (e.g.
age or liver function). [405][,][406] The decision to operate should therefore
be made by the Endocarditis Team (see *Section 4* ), [167] considering ur-­
gency of the patient’s clinical condition, peri-operative risk, the poten-­
tial to recover from the infection, and the patient’s associated
long-term prognosis. [403][,][404]

There are several scoring systems that predict mortality after general
(i.e. non-IE) cardiac surgery and which are in routine clinical use. [407][,][408]

Other scoring systems were designed specifically for the setting of IE in-­
cluding the AEPEI (Association for the Study and Prevention of Infective
Endocarditis Study) score, the STS (Society of Thoracic Surgeons) IE score,
the PALSUSE (prosthetic valve, age ≥70, large intracardiac destruction,
*Staphylococcus* spp., urgent surgery, sex [female], EuroSCORE ≥10) score,
the de Feo score, and the ANCLA (anaemia, NYHA [New York Heart
Association] class IV, critical state, large intracardiac destruction, surgery
of thoracic aorta) score, among others. [256][,][409][–][414] Some of these scoring
systems are web-based and free of charge (e.g. the AEPEI risk calculator
[https://www.endocardite.org/index.php/calculateurs/score-de-](https://www.endocardite.org/index.php/calculateurs/score-de-mortalite-post-chirurgie-aepei)
[mortalite-post-chirurgie-aepei). Such scoring systems have been devel-­](https://www.endocardite.org/index.php/calculateurs/score-de-mortalite-post-chirurgie-aepei)
oped based on retrospective data and their performance is vari-­
able. [250][,][256][,][415][–][417] In addition, none of these scoring systems are used in
daily clinical routine. Therefore, prospective surgical scoring systems
with better precision need to be developed, particularly for determining
operative futility in prohibitively high-risk patients.

A significant proportion of patients with clear indications for surgery
for IE may have multiple risk factors or other reasons that lead to sur-­
gery not being performed, and these patients have the worst progno-­
sis. [184][,][403] Conversely, high-risk but salvageable patients may not be
offered life-saving operations on the basis of perceived unacceptable
risk, and this is especially true in the elderly (see *Section 12.2* ). The com-­
plex decision of not offering surgery when indicated should therefore
be made in the setting of an Endocarditis Team with experienced sur-­
gical input. [418] Determining when operative management for a specific
patient is futile requires compassionate multidisciplinary insight along
with consideration of the patient’s and family’s wills (see *Section 13.2* ).

**8.2. Heart failure**

**8.2.1. Heart failure in infective endocarditis**

Heart failure is the most frequent complication of IE and the main indi-­
cation for urgent and emergency surgery for IE. [419] The prevalence of
HF with left-sided IE is variable and inconsistently defined between re-­
ported series, ranging between 19% and 73%. [420][–][425] Clinical symptoms

are mainly caused by congestion and may vary from mild dyspnoea to
severe and rapidly worsening dyspnoea, orthopnoea, pulmonary oe-­
dema, and cardiogenic shock. Factors associated with increased risk
of HF complicating the course of IE include older age, presence of
NVE with aortic valve involvement, and high comorbidity. [420][–][425]

Leaflet perforation and rupture, as well as mitral chordal rupture,
lead to new severe valvular regurgitation or worsening of pre-existent
valvular regurgitation and subsequent acute HF. Other less common
causes of HF include intracardiac fistulae, interference of the vegetation
mass with leaflet opening and closure, or myocardial infarction from ve-­
getations embolizing into the coronary arteries. Patients with rightsided IE complicated by HF present with symptoms of right heart con-­
gestion, as discussed in *Section 12.6* .

New-onset HF is the predominant clinical presentation in IE patients,
whereas worsening of pre-existing HF is less frequent. Cardiogenic
shock can be the first presentation in up to 5% of cases, of which half
of such patients develop cardiogenic shock within 72 h of admission
for IE. [424] On imaging tests, patients with IE complicated by HF present
more frequently with lower left ventricular ejection fraction, larger
vegetation size, perivalvular abscesses, pseudoaneurysms, and valvular
regurgitation secondary to leaflet perforation or rupture. [420][–][425]

Heart failure complicating IE is independently associated with poor
in-hospital and 1-year survival, and surgical treatment is the only effect-­
ive treatment that is associated with improved survival. [420][,][421][,][424][,][426][–][430]

Even though in-hospital mortality rates increase with the severity of HF
presentation, the survival benefit of surgical treatment vs. medical ther-­
apy is more pronounced among patients with NYHA functional class
III–IV symptoms. [420] TTE provides important information on the sever-­
ity of the haemodynamic consequences of valve dysfunction. New on-­
set of elevated filling pressures, pulmonary hypertension, and/or
pericardial effusion may lead to urgent or emergency recommendation
for surgery. [163] Biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide and
troponin have been associated with poor prognosis in IE. [431][,][432]

Patients who are discharged after treatment of IE require subsequent
follow-up (see *Section 11* ). Heart failure is more likely to develop during
follow-up in IE patients who are discharged with valvular regurgitation
than in those without regurgitation, particularly if mitral regurgitation is
present. [433]

**8.2.2. Indications and timing of surgery in the**
**presence of heart failure in infective endocarditis**
Timing of surgical intervention in patients with IE ( *Figure 10* ) compli-­
cated by HF should be decided by the Endocarditis Team, although sur-­
gery should not be delayed by Endocarditis Team discussions in patients
requiring emergency operations. The presence of HF leads to recom-­
mendation for surgery in the majority of patients and is the principal in-­
dication for urgent surgery in IE patients. [429][,][434] Emergency surgery
should be performed in patients with new-onset NYHA class IV HF
symptoms, pulmonary oedema, and/or cardiogenic shock, irrespective
of the status of infection or length of antibiotic treatment and when
considered non-futile intervention. Urgent surgery is indicated in pa-­
tients with milder forms of HF (NYHA class II–III) and severe valve re-­
gurgitation or echocardiographic signs of haemodynamic compromise
(elevated end-diastolic left ventricular pressure, high left atrial pressure,
or moderate and severe pulmonary hypertension), or large vegetations.
In patients without haemodynamic compromise, i.v. antibiotic therapy
and strict clinical and echocardiographic observation are first indicated,
and surgery can be temporarily delayed. However, it should be


emphasized that early surgery is a good option for patients with surgical
indications and low risk of surgery. [403][,][404]

**8.3. Uncontrolled infection**

Uncontrolled infection is one of the most common complications of IE
and is the second most frequent indication for surgery. [5] Uncontrolled
infection is considered to be present when there is: (i) persistent infec-­
tion or sepsis despite antibiotic therapy; (ii) signs of local infection that
do not respond to antibiotic therapy; or (iii) infection with resistant or
very virulent organisms.

**8.3.1. Septic shock and persistent infection**
Septic shock, defined as vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean
arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or greater and serum lactate level greater
than 2 mmol/L in the absence of hypovolaemia, [435] is a highly lethal com-­
plication of IE and occurs in ∼5–10% of patients. [425][,][436] Risk factors for
septic shock include *S. aureus* and Gram-negative bacteria, persistent
bacteraemia, nosocomial acquisition, acute renal failure, diabetes melli-­
tus, CNS emboli, and large vegetations. [147][,][436] Surgery is associated with
a significant reduction in early and 1-year mortality for patients with IE
and septic shock. [425][,][436] Urgent surgery is therefore recommended in
patients with IE and persistent sepsis or septic shock despite adequate
antibiotic therapy, in which surgery is non-futile.

The definition of persistent infection is somewhat arbitrary and con-­
sists of fever and persistent positive cultures after 7 days of appropriate
antibiotic treatment. It has been demonstrated that persistent blood
cultures 48–72 h after initiation of antibiotics are an independent risk
factor for hospital mortality. [437] In many cases of persistent infection,
antibiotics alone are insufficient to eradicate the infection. Surgery is
therefore indicated for persistent infection when extracardiac ab-­
scesses (splenic, vertebral, cerebral, or renal) and other potential causes
of positive cultures and fever (infected lines and embolic complications)
have been excluded. Persistent fever may also be caused as an adverse
reaction to antibiotics. [438]

**8.3.2. Locally uncontrolled infection**

Signs of locally uncontrolled infection include increasing vegetation size,
abscess formation, the creation of pseudoaneurysms and/or fistulae,
and new atrioventricular block (AVB). The incidence of perivalvular ex-­
tension ranges from 10% to 30% in NVE with higher incidences found in
patients with PVE. [5][,][439] Perivalvular complications and abscess forma-­
tion are more frequent in aortic valve than mitral valve IE, and may
be higher in patients with bicuspid vs. tricuspid aortic valves. [440] In aortic
valve IE, perivalvular extension occurs most frequently in the
mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa, [441] whereas perivalvular abscesses
are usually located posteriorly or laterally in mitral valve IE. [442]

Persistent fever and infection, new AVB, chest pain, new heart murmur,
recurrent embolism, or HF may indicate perivalvular extension. The
diagnosis should be confirmed by TOE, which is more sensitive and spe-­
cific than TTE. [443] However, mitral annular calcification may obscure
small regions of mitral perivalvular extension, particularly in the poster-­
ior aspects of the mitral annulus. Cardiac CT has been shown to be an
accurate alternative imaging procedure for the evaluation of perivalvu-­
lar extension of infection, and PET/CT imaging may be particularly help-­
ful in cases of PVE (see *Section 5.4.4* .

**3990** ESC Guidelines


**8.3.3 Indications and timing of surgery in the presence**
**of uncontrolled infection**

Surgery should be considered for uncontrolled infection when antibiot-­
ic therapy is ineffective and extracardiac sources are ruled out. Reports
in the literature demonstrate that surgery for uncontrolled infection in
IE has the potential to improve 1-year survival by 15–20%. [403][,][429][,][444]

*8.3.3.1. Persistent infection*

Uncontrolled infection is present in the form of persistent infection
when blood cultures remain positive for >1 week or persistent sepsis
despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy and when other causes of
bacteraemia have been excluded. Not performing surgery for uncon-­
trolled infection is associated with significantly increased mortality. [444]

*8.3.3.2. Locally uncontrolled infection*

Uncontrolled infection is also present if signs of local progression, i.e.
increasing vegetation size or perivalvular involvement, are observed
during follow-up imaging. [5][,][420][,][421][,][445][,][446] Surgery should be performed
urgently (within 3–5 days) in such cases. Rarely, when there are no
other reasons for surgery and fever is easily controlled with antibiotics,
small abscesses or pseudoaneurysms can be treated conservatively un-­
der close clinical and echocardiographic follow-up. [429][,][444]

*8.3.3.3. Infection with resistant or virulent organisms*

Microorganisms causing endocarditis that are unlikely to be controlled
with current antimicrobial therapy include fungi, [447][,][448] multiresistant
bacteria (e.g. MRSA or vancomycin-resistant enterococci) and, in rare
cases, non-HACEK Gram-negative bacteria. *S. aureus* should also be in-­
cluded in this group due to its fast progression and ability to cause local
tissue destruction and abscess formation, [5][,][449] specifically, if a favourable
early response to antibiotics is not achieved. [305][,][312][,][449] The presence of
these organisms should lead to discussions within the Endocarditis
Team and urgent surgery. [385][,][450]

**8.4. Prevention of systemic embolism**

**8.4.1. Incidence of embolic events in infective**

**endocarditis**

Embolic events are frequent and potentially life-threatening complica-­
tions of IE related to the migration of cardiac vegetations. [451][,][452] The
brain and spleen are the most frequent sites of embolism for left-sided
IE, while pulmonary embolism is frequent in right-sided and pacemaker
lead IE (see *Section 12* ). Stroke may be the first clinical manifestation of
IE, and is a severe complication that is associated with increased mor-­
bidity and mortality. [451][,][453][,][454] Embolic events may be clinically silent in
up to 50% of patients with IE. [198] Emboli affecting the splenic or cerebral
circulation are frequently asymptomatic, and are diagnosed by noninvasive imaging. [197][,][200] Although whole-body CT imaging (i.e. chest,
abdomen, and pelvis) is frequently performed during the work-up for
surgery, diagnosis and management of patients is infrequently altered
as a result of these investigations. [194] However, cerebral CT may affect
clinical decision-making and outcomes when surgery is considered. [452]

Embolic risk in IE is high, with 20–50% of patients being af-­
fected. [452][,][455] The highest incidence of embolic strokes can be observed
in the days around the initial diagnosis of IE, [456] and embolic events are
often what leads to the initial diagnosis of IE. Embolic risk is highest the
day after therapy initiation, and is 10–20 times higher on the day before


and after the start of antibiotic treatment compared with 2 weeks be-­
fore and after. [456] Thus, embolic events occurring after the initiation of
antibiotic therapy continuously drop in incidence within the first 2
weeks of antibiotic treatment. [429][,][455][–][457] The benefits of surgery to pre-­
vent embolism may therefore be greatest during the early stages of
therapy, when embolic risk is at its highest.

**8.4.2. Predicting the risk of embolism**

Predicting the risks of embolization is important for decision-making in
IE. Echocardiography plays a key role in identifying potentially embolic
structures in the heart, [429][,][455][,][456][,][458] although predicting the time point
of embolization remains difficult. Several factors are associated with in-­
creased risk of embolism including the size and mobility of vegeta-­
tions, [455][,][456][,][458][–][460] the location of the vegetation on the mitral
valve, [455] the increasing or decreasing size of the vegetation under anti-­
biotic therapy, [455] particular microorganisms (especially *S. aureus*, [455]

*S. gallolyticus*, [461] and *Candida* spp. [450] ), previous embolism, [455] multivalv-­
ular involvement, [458] and biological markers. [462] Among these, the size
and mobility of the vegetations are the most important independent
predictors of new embolic events. [459][,][460][,][463] A recent study, however,
demonstrated that vegetation size was predictive of worse outcomes
only when present with other indications for surgery (i.e. HF or uncon-­
trolled infection). [464] Staphylococcal endocarditis is also a risk factor for
embolization, [465][–][468] which is particularly important because the inci-­
dence of *S. aureus* IE is increasing. [78][,][469] Risk of neurological complica-­
tions is particularly high in patients with very large vegetations
(>30 mm in length). [451]

Additional factors may need to be taken into account and it may be
helpful to use an embolic risk calculator. [470] *S. aureus* infection, previous
embolism, vegetation length, age, diabetes, and the presence of atrial
fibrillation have been identified as specific risk factors for embolism. [470]

**8.4.3. Indications and timing of surgery to prevent**
**embolism in infective endocarditis**

Surgical removal of potentially embolic material from the heart may
prevent new or additional embolic events. Given the imminent risk
and high rates of embolization in patients with mobile and large vegeta-­
tions, [5][,][451][,][455][–][457][,][460][,][471] surgery should be considered urgently (within
3–5 days) in such patients. A prospective randomized trial in young,
low-risk patients assessed the effects of early surgery in patients with
large vegetations and streptococcal IE. [471] Although there was no differ-­
ence in all-cause mortality at 6 months between the early surgery and
conventional treatment groups, the risk of embolization was significant-­
ly reduced with early surgery. Non-randomized observational analyses
including patients at higher risk also suggest that early surgery may be
beneficial in patients with a high likelihood of embolization, [428][,][459][,][472][,][473]

and that initial conservative treatment is associated with increased mor-­
tality. [474][,][475] However, prosthetic dehiscence has also been associated
with early surgery in patients with *S. aureus* IE. [429] Individualized
decision-making is required to balance the risk of surgery, which is
also influenced by pre-operative neurological events or other
co-morbidities. [5][,][453]

The main indications and the timing of surgery to prevent embolism
based on the currently available literature are given in Recommendation

#### **9. Other complications of infective ** **endocarditis**

**9.1. Neurological complications**
Neurological manifestations may occur before or after the diagnosis of
IE is established and recurrent events can also take place later in the
course of IE. [451] The possibility of IE should be considered in patients
who present with stroke, meningitis, or brain abscess. Unexplained fe-­
ver accompanying a stroke in a patient with valvular disease should trig-­
ger the suspicion of IE with blood cultures taken prior to empirical
antibiotic therapy.

Symptomatic cerebrovascular complications occur in up to 35% of pa-­
tients with IE, [145][,][198][,][451][,][452] whereas silent cerebrovascular complications
(including ischaemia and microhaemorrhage) occur in up to 80% of pa-­
tients. [200][,][204][,][403] Clinical presentation is variable, but ischaemic stroke and
transient ischaemic attack are the most common presentations. [479]

Other manifestations include haemorrhage (intracerebral, subarachnoid),
meningitis, brain abscess, encephalopathy, and infectious aneurysms. Focal
neurological symptoms are present in ∼40% of affected patients, and nonfocal presentations occur in approximately one-third.

*S. aureus* IE is more frequently associated with neurological compli-­
cations compared with IE caused by other microorganisms.
Vegetation size and mobility also correlate with embolic risk.

Neurological complications are associated with excess mortality, as
well as long-term morbidity, particularly in the case of stroke. [480]

Prompt diagnosis of IE and early initiation of the antibiotic therapy are
pivotal to preventing neurological complications. Early cardiac surgery
in high-risk patients is key to preventing embolization of vegeta-­
tions. [471][,][481] In contrast, antithrombotic/thrombolytic medical therapies
are not beneficial. [481][–][483]

Mechanical thrombectomy may be considered within time limits in
selected cases. [484] If mechanical thrombectomy is performed, the re-­
trieved embolic material must be sent off for pathological and microbio-­
logical analyses. Neurosurgery or endovascular therapy is
recommended for large infective aneurysms, especially when a continu-­
ous growth, despite optimal antibiotic therapy or ruptured intracranial
infective aneurysms, is observed. [485]

The use of anticoagulation in patients with left-sided IE does not
seem to have an effect on the risk of stroke, cerebrovascular haemor-­
rhage, or mortality at 10 weeks and, therefore, continuation of
anticoagulation in patients with left-sided IE and with a pre-existing in-­
dication for the use of anticoagulants is recommended in the absence of
other contraindications. [486] Substitution from oral anticoagulation to
heparin in such patients is generally preferred in case of cerebral bleed-­
ing or indication for early surgery.

Following a neurological event, the indication for cardiac surgery must
be balanced against the peri-operative risk and post-operative prognosis
of the patient. Randomized studies are impractical and cohort studies suf-­
fer from bias that can only be partially compensated for by statistical meth-­
ods. The majority of publications demonstrate lower risk of secondary
haemorrhagic conversion of uncomplicated ischaemic lesions than the
risk of recurrent embolism under antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the

available evidence supports early surgery in such patients (see *Section 10.4* ).

Recommendation Table 13 summarizes the recommended manage-­
ment of neurological complications in IE; considerations for cardiac sur-­
gery after neurological complications are discussed in *Section 10.4* .

**3992** ESC Guidelines


**9.1.1. The role of cerebral imaging in infective**
**endocarditis**

Cerebral imaging is mandatory when neurological complications of IE
are suspected. Evaluation should include MRI with and without gadolin-­
ium, or CT with and without contrast if MRI is not possible. [487] Vascular
imaging should not be performed routinely, and CTA or magnetic res-­
onance angiography (MRA) is probably sufficient for screening when in-­
fective aneurysm is suspected. Catheter angiography should be
performed in patients in whom an infective aneurysm was diagnosed
on CTA or MRA, in patients with an acute brain haemorrhage, or if
the suspicion of aneurysm remains despite negative non-invasive tech-­
niques, and if mechanical thrombectomy is considered. [488]

In patients without neurological symptoms, cerebral MRI often de-­
tects ‘silent’ lesions such as microbleeds. [204] The lack of association

with parenchymal haemorrhage and the absence of post-operative
neurological complications in patients with microbleeds suggest that
microbleeds should not postpone surgery when indicated. [489]

**9.2. Infective aneurysms**
An infective (mycotic) aneurysm is a rare but potentially devastating com-­
plication of IE. Infective cerebral aneurysms may be asymptomatic, cause
headaches, seizures, or focal symptoms, and may progress to a potentially
lethal rupture. They are associated with subarachnoid, intracerebral, and
intracranial haemorrhage, [201] particularly when the patient is
anticoagulated. The true incidence of infective cerebral aneurysms may
be underdiagnosed as vascular imaging modalities are not systematically
performed in asymptomatic patients. In 168 patients who underwent
cerebral angiography with a diagnosis of IE or infected left ventricular assist
device were retrospectively reviewed and infective aneurysms were pre-­
sent in 9% of patients. [488] Another series using CTA identified infective an-­
eurysms in up to 32% of patients with left-sided IE. [492]


Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the gold standard
diagnostic test for the detection of infective aneurysms. [487] The sensitiv-­
ity of CTA and MRA progressively increases with the size of the aneur-­
ysm. In a large study including 142 patients, the sensitivity for detection
of infective aneurysms smaller than 5 mm was 57% for CTA and 35%
for MRA, compared with respective 94% and 86% sensitivities for the
detection of aneurysms of 5 mm or larger. [493] Compared with the sen-­
sitivity of DSA, the sensitivities of CTA and MRA for detecting infective
aneurysms are inferior. [488][,][490] Therefore, in patients with IE and high
suspicion of infective aneurysms in whom CTA or MRA are negative,
DSA may be considered. [490][,][494]

Treatment options of infective cerebral aneurysms consist of anti-­
biotic treatment with or without endovascular or surgical therapy, al-­
though evidence is limited to case reports and retrospective
studies. [495][–][498] Therefore, management should be discussed among

the members of the Endocarditis Team and tailored to individual clinical
situations. Shi *et al.* [496] reported that in patients with unruptured infect-­
ive cerebral aneurysms, antibiotic treatment may have similar outcomes
to invasive treatment. However, interventional treatment should be
considered in cases of ruptured infective aneurysms or unruptured in-­
fective aneurysms that do not respond to antibiotic therapy. [485][,][495]

Endovascular therapy is highly successful and associated with low
morbidity compared with microsurgical and medical manage-­
ment. [487][,][499] A systematic review including 499 patients with infective
cerebral aneurysms reported a 36% rate of aneurysm rupture. [495]

Endovascular surgical and conservative therapies were performed in
an approximately equal number of patients. Among patients undergo-­
ing valve surgery in this series, only 15% underwent cardiac surgery be-­
fore aneurysm treatment whereas 85% underwent cardiac surgery
after aneurysm treatment. [495]

Urgency of cardiac surgery plays a pivotal role in decision-making re-­
garding the type of invasive treatment. Compared with neurosurgical
clipping that requires a craniotomy and often at least 2-week delay
prior to procedure, cardiovascular surgery can be performed on the
same day as endovascular treatment. [485][,][487][,][496][,][499] Finally, endovascular
treatment of infective cerebral aneurysms prior to heart valve surgery
may be considered, even if no rupture is documented. [499]

**9.3. Splenic complications**
Splenic complications associated with IE range from asymptomatic in-­
farction [500] and abscess formation [501] through to splenic rupture and
cardiovascular collapse. [502] Splenic infarcts are common (∼20% of pa-­
tients in the EURO-ENDO registry) and very often asymptomatic. [5]

Up to 5% of splenic infarcts can progress to abscess formation. [503]

Persistent or recurrent fever, abdominal pain, and persistent bacter-­
aemia are suggestive for the presence of such complications. Patients
with suspected splenic complications should be evaluated with ultra-­
sound, abdominal CT, MRI, or PET/CT. [504]

Treatment of splenic complications includes conservative medical
therapy with appropriate antibiotics for splenic infarction or for
antibiotic-responsive abscesses, although antibiotic penetration may
be poor in these circumstances. When an abscess is large, splenectomy
may be considered, but the timing of splenectomy in relation to heart
valve surgery needs careful assessment. [505] Splenectomy and heart valve
surgery are seldom performed in the same operative episode. [506]

Splenectomy is usually performed prior to valve surgery due to con-­
cerns of dissemination and reinfection of the heart valve.

ESC Guidelines **3993**


Nevertheless, one case series reported that it is safe to address the
splenic abscess with splenectomy after valve repair. [502] Alternatives to
open splenectomy, i.e. percutaneous drainage [507] and/or laparoscopic
surgery, [508] may be considered in patients with high surgical risk.
After splenectomy, vaccination against encapsulated microorganisms
( *S. pneumoniae*, *N. meningitis*, and *Haemophilus* spp.) is recommended.

**9.4. Myocarditis and pericarditis**
The actual prevalence of acute myocarditis in the setting of IE is un-­
known. Myocarditis will usually present in the form of acute HF and/
or ventricular arrhythmias indicating myocardial involvement in the in-­
flammatory process most likely mediated by an immune mechanism.
Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other potential complications
are best assessed using echocardiography and cardiac MRI. [509][–][511]

Pericarditis is an infrequent complication of IE. In one retrospective
series of 95 patients with aortic valve IE, 19% developed pericarditis
usually related to ring abscess formation. The same authors also de-­
scribed a 12% rate of pericarditis associated with mitral valve
IE. [512][,][513] The pathophysiological mechanisms most commonly involved
in IE-related pericarditis are the extension of inflammation from an in-­
fective aneurysm of the aortic root or valve ring abscess, an embolus in
an extramural coronary artery, or the rupture of an infective aneurysm.
In a recent large series of NVE, pericardial effusion was observed in
7.8% of patients and was associated with a higher risk of HF during ad-­
mission. After adjusting for possible confounders, patients did not have
a higher rate of surgery, and the presence of pericardial effusion was not
associated with a higher in-hospital or 1-year mortality. [513]

**9.5. Heart rhythm and conduction**
**disturbances**

Due to the critical anatomical relationship between heart valves and the
conduction system, AVB may complicate the clinical presentation of IE.
The atrioventricular node (AVN) and His bundle lie in close proximity
to the insertion of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, the aortic
root (below the non-coronary and right coronary cusps), and the mitral
annulus. [514] A paravalvular abscess of these valves, especially of the aor-­
tic valve, may lead to AVB, and new electrocardiographic AVN conduc-­
tion abnormalities are indicative of a paravalvular extension of the
infection. In the EURO-ENDO registry, conduction abnormalities
were observed at diagnosis in 11.5% of patients, including first-degree
AVB in 8.1%, second-degree AVB in 0.6%, and third-degree AVB in
2.8% of cases. [5] New-onset AVB caused by local extension of IE (i.e. ab-­
scess) is an indication for urgent cardiac surgery.

Atrioventricular block may not only occur as a complication of para-­
valvular extension of the infection, but it may also develop as a conse-­
quence of valve surgery. In a series of 444 patients who survived cardiac
surgery for IE, [515] 12.8% of patients required pacemaker implantation
for AVB. Multivariable analysis identified that prolonged pre-operative
PR and QRS intervals, *S. aureus* infection, presence of aortic root ab-­
scess, tricuspid valve involvement, and prior valvular surgery were inde-­
pendently associated with the need for post-operative pacemaker
implantation.

Pacemaker implantation should be considered in patients with sur-­
gery for valvular endocarditis and complete AVB if one or more of
these risk factors is present. [515]

**9.6. Musculoskeletal manifestations**

**9.6.1. Osteoarticular infective endocarditis-related**

**infections**

Metastatic bone or joint IE-related lesions are relatively frequent due to
the spread of the pathogen through the bloodstream and its subse-­
quent tissue implantation. Although these lesions are considered an
IE-related distal lesion or complication because infected valves are a
continuous source of bacteraemia, it is often impossible to determine
whether the primary infection is the valve or the osteoarticular infec-­
tion. Overall, the incidence of osteoarticular infection among patients
with IE is 6–8%, including bones, joints, and vertebral discs. [5][,][145][,][247][,][516]

The prevalence of spondylodiscitis ranges from 2% to 10% in patients
with IE, including symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, [248][,][517] while
series of spontaneous spondylodiscitis have reported co-existing IE in
up to 20–30% of patients. [518][–][520] In general, the rate of IE is 10 times
higher in patients with known spondylodiscitis. Therefore, in patients
with a definite diagnosis of pyogenic spondylodiscitis and positive blood
cultures, TTE/TOE is recommended to rule out IE. [521]

The most frequent microorganisms associated with spondylodiscitis
are *S. aureus*, followed by *Streptococcus* spp., CoNS, and *Enterococcus*
spp. [247][,][248][,][305][,][517][–][523]

The most common symptom of spondylodiscitis is back pain, al-­
though only 4% of patients with IE and back pain have spondylodisci-­
tis. [32][,][522] An MRI should be performed to accurately diagnose
spondylodiscitis. Computed tomography can detect indirect signs of
spondylodiscitis: loss of disc height, erosion/destruction of the end-­
plates and vertebral bodies, and paravertebral soft tissue phlegmonous
changes or abscess. [206] Whole-body [18F]FDG-PET/CT can also iden-­
tify spondylodiscitis. [30][,][32][,][524] Indeed, spondylodiscitis is frequently de-­
tected as an incidental finding when PET/CT is performed for the
diagnosis of PVE. Imaging techniques can also be helpful in guiding biop-­
sies to obtain material for cultures in cases of suspected IE with negative
blood cultures. [206]

Antibiotic treatment adapted to the antimicrobial susceptibility pat-­
tern is appropriate for most cases of spondylodiscitis. The outcome is
usually favourable with the 4- to 6-week IE treatment course.
Prolonged therapy is necessary in patients with IE caused by
difficult-to-treat microorganisms, such as *S. aureus* or *Candida* spp., or
in those with epidural or perivertebral abscesses. [523][,][525] In patients
with neurological deficits or severe spinal instability, the indication for

**3994** ESC Guidelines


surgical spinal treatment should be considered. [526] In patients with ur-­
gent indication for cardiac surgery, the presence of these lesions
does not contraindicate the cardiac intervention. Spondylodiscitis
does not appear to worsen the prognosis of patients with IE but delay-­
ing the diagnosis of IE in patients with spondylodiscitis is associated with
poor prognosis. [248][,][517][–][520]

**9.6.2. Rheumatological manifestations**

The pathogenesis of rheumatological manifestations and musculoskeletal
symptoms in IE is not well established. The probable immunologicalinflammatory aetiology of this clinical presentation is supported by a var-­
iety of antibodies and laboratory markers, the sterility of the synovial fluid,
and the rapid resolution without sequelae. [527] Myalgia and back pain are re-­
ported in 12–15% of cases. Arthralgia occurs in ∼10% of patients, some-­
times sequentially affecting several joints. Slightly less often are symptoms
of peripheral arthritis preferentially involving the major and proximal joints
at the lower extremities. [5][,][145][,][182][,][516]

Sacroiliitis is less frequently observed (1% of cases) as well as poly-­
myalgia rheumatic-like syndrome with pain and morning stiffness of
the shoulders and hips, proximal muscle weakness (0.9% of cases),
and cutaneous leucocytoclastic vasculitis (purpuric skin lesions, 3.6%
of cases). [182][,][527][,][528] Rheumatological manifestations and musculoskel-­
etal symptoms show rapid and complete resolution with antibiotics
and their presence does not impact on the prognosis of IE. [182][,][529]

**9.7. Acute renal failure**

Acute renal failure is a common complication of IE and is associated
with increased morbidity and mortality as well as significant increase
in length and cost of hospitalization. [5][,][531][–][534] Additionally, renal failure
is an independent predictor of poor outcome after cardiac surgery. [417]

However, acute renal failure should not be a reason to delay cardiac
surgery. The EURO-ENDO registry reported that in patients with IE,
acute renal failure was the second most common complication with
an incidence of almost 18%. [5] Some single-centre studies that specifically


reported on the incidence of acute renal failure (using standardized cri-­
teria) in patients with IE reported that any degree of acute renal failure
from mild to severe might be observed in 40–69% of cases. [532][,][535][,][536]

Severe renal failure requiring haemodialysis has been reported in 6%
of patients with IE and it is associated with a very high risk of mortality
(40%). [537]

Several factors may be responsible for the onset or worsening of re-­
nal dysfunction: (i) immune complex and vasculitic glomerulonephritis;
(ii) renal infarction due to septic emboli; [538][,][539] (iii) haemodynamic im-­
pairment in patients with HF; (iv) antibiotic and other drug toxicity
(notably related to aminoglycosides, vancomycin, nafcillin, amoxicillin,
oxacillin, concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, and/
or high dose loop diuretics); and (v) nephrotoxicity of contrast agents
used for diagnostic imaging techniques. [417][,][531][,][534][,][535][,][537][,][540]

To reduce the incidence of acute renal failure, nephrotoxic antibio-­
tics should be avoided if possible or, if not possible, serum levels (ami-­
noglycosides and vancomycin) as well as creatinine should be closely
monitored, and the optimal dose of medication should be periodically
re-evaluated and discussed with the Endocarditis Team and a pharma-­
cologist. [536] Loop diuretics should also be used cautiously and other po-­
tentially nephrotoxic drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories,
should be avoided. [536] Similarly, the use of nephrotoxic contrast agents
for diagnostic imaging techniques should be carefully evaluated and
avoided when possible.

In patients with IE and a reduced glomerular filtration rate, contrast
enhanced abdominal ultrasound or MRI are reasonable tests to diag-­
nose embolization as cause of renal function impairment. [541]
#### **10. Surgical therapy: principles and ** **methods**

Surgery has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of sur-­
vival in many retrospective studies of IE patients under various clinical
conditions and offers a potential curative therapy to select patient
groups. [5][,][250][,][403][,][404][,][421][,][436] Optimal management of such patients may
lead to lower peri-operative complication rates and further potential
benefits of surgical therapy.

**10.1. Pre-operative and peri-operative**
**management**
**10.1.1. Coronary angiography**

When cardiac surgery becomes necessary in IE, assessment of coronary
anatomy is recommended (see Recommendation Table 16). Classically,
pre-operative coronary angiography is recommended for men >40
years, post-menopausal women, and in those with one or more cardio-­
vascular risk factors or history of CAD. [128] The presence of aortic valve
vegetations may preclude invasive coronary angiography due to the risk
of iatrogenic embolization. [542][,][543] However, some studies have demon-­
strated the safety of performing invasive coronary angiography in the
presence of aortic valve vegetations, particularly in patients without
very large and mobile vegetations. [193][,][544] Alternatively, coronary CTA
can be used to rule out significant coronary obstructions.
Furthermore, surgery may need to be conducted without detailed in-­
formation on coronary anatomy in certain clinical conditions, particu-­
larly emergencies. Of note, a recent study questioned the need for
coronary artery bypass grafting of non-critical lesions at the time of sur-­
gery for IE and suggested that such concomitant intervention may have
a negative impact on peri-operative outcomes. [545]

**10.1.2. Extracardiac infection**

Extracardiac foci may be treated prior to valve surgery, during the valve
operation, or post-operatively, dependent on the urgency of cardiac
surgery. Regardless of the timing of intervention, infective foci need
to be eradicated before completion of antibiotic therapy in order to

avoid cardiac valve reinfection.

**10.1.3. Intra-operative echocardiography**
Intra-operative TOE provides contemporaneous assessment of the ex-­
tent of infection prior to valve repair/replacement. Extent of infection,
stability of known vegetations, re-assessment of previously uninvolved
heart valves, and biventricular function are routinely performed with
intra-operative TOE. Intra-operative TOE post-surgical repair is man-­
datory to determine the immediate result and establish a baseline for
follow-up comparisons. [547]

**10.2. Other intra-operative considerations**
Specific peri-operative management considerations are necessary in all
IE patients undergoing valve surgery, particularly in those following
stroke (see *Section 10.3* ). Pre-operative antibiotic therapy must be con-­
tinued intra-operatively, and doses may need to be repeated in case of
prolonged operations or major bleeding. Although the pharmacokinet-­
ics of antibiotic therapy is altered during cardio-pulmonary bypass
(CPB), adjustment of doses is rarely required. [548] In general, ongoing
IE antibiotic treatment offers appropriate surgical site infection prophy-­
laxis. However, when the antibiotic treatment for IE does not fully cov-­
er normal surgical prophylactic treatment, conventional prophylaxis
should be added. Intra-operative bleeding management is often compli-­
cated by marked coagulopathy in patients with IE, particularly those
undergoing surgery during persistent sepsis. The management of hypo-­
tension and vasoplaegia is particularly challenging in patients presenting
with septic shock, and accompanying vasoplaegia tends to worsen sig-­
nificantly during CPB. Norepinephrine is frequently used as first-line
therapy for septic shock, followed by vasopressin or terlipressin in cases


of resistant vasoplaegia. [549] Methylene blue may be used as a rescue
agent in patients who are unresponsive to these measures, but mortal-­
ity rates are high for such patients. [550]

Retrospective studies have suggested that the use of haemoadsor-­
bent filters during CPB may decrease the negative effects associated
with cytokine cascade activation. [551] A recent RCT of haemoadsorption
during cardiac surgery in IE patients, however, failed to demonstrate
any beneficial effects with regards to adverse events or end-organ
function. [552]

**10.3. Surgical approach and techniques**
Surgery for IE aims to remove infected structures followed by reestablishment of anatomy and haemodynamic function. With regards
to the involved heart valve(s), repair or replacement is carried out
based on the extent of destruction, acuity of disease, and patient char-­
acteristics. [553] Appropriate collection and labelling of tissue samples for
pathological, microbiological, and molecular biological analyses are ne-­
cessary to help guide antibiotic treatment.

Aortic valve replacement is usually required for aortic IE. Aortic valve
repair is very uncommon in the acute situation but may be performed
for isolated aortic regurgitation after healed endocarditis. In mitral IE, leaf-­
let perforations with preserved free margin and chordae tendinae may be
treated with patch repair, particularly in the setting of subacute or healed
IE. Although mitral valve repair is feasible in more complex mitral IE involv-­
ing the annuli, the leaflet free edge, and/or chordae, evidence showing the
feasibility and durability of such repair techniques is scarce. [554][,][555] A large
registry on mitral repair vs. replacement in IE was limited by the lack of in-­
formation on severity of IE, different patient group profiles, and significantly
higher incidence of staphylococcal endocarditis in the mitral valve replace-­
ment group. [556] Therefore, it cannot be concluded that mitral valve repair is
superior to replacement due to the high probability of selection bias. Valve
preservation in acute IE should only be attempted if a durable repair is an-­
ticipated and complete eradication of infected tissue can be achieved.
However, valve repair may be necessary in children, where valve replace-­
ment options are more limited.

Invasion of the aortic annuli may create shallow defects (very limited
abscess or small pseudoaneurysms) that are still amenable to conven-­
tional valve replacement surgery. When disease progresses into an ex-­
tensive aortic root abscess or periannular destruction, aortic root
replacement is usually required. In experienced centres, the use of allo-­
grafts has been preferred as they have the advantage of adapting to ir-­
regular surfaces and provide haemostatic advantages with very good
haemodynamic function and low thrombo-embolic risk, and can be
used to repair concomitant lesions of the anterior mitral valve leaf-­
let. [557][,][558] Additionally, allografts and stentless bioprostheses can be
beneficial in small aortic roots and are associated with low reinfection
rates. However, experience is generally limited to single-centre case
series and there is no clear evidence of superiority of one valve substi-­
tute over the other. [559] In very selected patients and children in particu-­
lar, the Ross operation (pulmonary valve autotransplantation) may be
considered for aortic root IE. [128]

The use of patches to cover abscess cavities and prevent extensive
resection and reconstruction is discouraged in aortic root IE as it
may be associated with recurrences, periprosthetic leaks, and pseudoa-­
neurysm formation. After exclusion from the circulation, abscess and
pseudoaneurysm cavities are left to drain into the pericardial cavity.

When periannular infection of the aortic root extends into the inter-­
valvular fibrosa body, complex surgical reconstructions are required and
are frequently the only option to achieve patient survival. The reported

pooled peri-operative survival rate of such surgical technique is 84%. [560]

Even more extensive repairs may be required for cases involving the in-­
tervalvular fibrosa, central fibrous body, and mitral valve, with or without
fistulation to the right-side chambers. These operations are technically
complex and require a surgeon who is very experienced in IE, which
may not be available in every cardiovascular surgery department.

Exceptionally, heart transplantation has been utilized for carefully se-­
lected patients without other surgical options. [561]


valve selection in IE is influenced by the presence of recent stroke, risk

**10.3.1. Choice of valve prosthesis**

Many patient characteristics are taken into account when deciding the
type of valve prosthesis to implant in a given patient with IE. The studies
published to date evaluating various valve prostheses in the setting of IE,
however, suffer from numerous biases. [90][,][559][,][562][–][566]

Beyond the patient characteristics that apply in the non-IE setting, [128]

ESC Guidelines **3997**


Table 12 **Features favouring a non-mechanical valve**

**endocarditis**










and the ability of the patient to participate in decision-making, especially
for emergency surgery ( *Table 12* ). In the absence of specific
contraindications for a particular valve substitute, patient preferences
should determine the final decision.

**10.4. Timing of surgery after ischaemic and**
**haemorrhagic stroke**
There is a general trend of offering early surgery in IE in light of the im-­
proved operative outcomes and survival benefits observed with operative
management. [451][,][567] For patients who have suffered a neurological injury,
however, the optimal timing of surgery remains to be defined. [568] There
are no RCTs specifically assessing this clinically relevant issue and contem-­
porary evidence arises from observational studies. [415][,][454][,][473][,][569][,][570]

Neurological exacerbation may occur during surgery or early postoperatively due to the altered physiology conditions during and imme-­
diately after cardiac repair. [571] Several peri-operative variables should be
addressed in order to lower the risk of neurological deterioration and
haemorrhagic transformation post-stroke (see [Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)
online, *[Table S10](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)* ).

The risk of neurological exacerbation during surgery needs to be ba-­
lanced against that of delaying a cardiac operation. When haemo-­
dynamic disturbances are present, surgery should be pursued
without delay (see *Figure* *11* and Recommendation
Table 17). [451][,][468][,][473][,][567][,][568][,][570][–][578] A more common situation occurs
when surgery is considered for the prevention of recurrent embolism
after stroke, due to the presence of large vegetations (>10 mm). In pa-­
tients that have suffered a transient ischaemic attack, the risk of surgery
is usually low and surgery should be performed without delay. For
patients with ischaemic stroke, multiple observational data exist sup-­
porting a non-delayed (urgent) intervention, unless the neurological
status is poor (i.e. coma or extensive damage leading to poor functional
prognosis). [573][,][578] Involvement of an expert neurology/neurosurgical
specialist will help in risk assessment discussions.

The risk of post-operative haemorrhagic conversion after preoperative stroke is reported in the range of 2–7%. [453][,][579] Remarkably,
bleeding transformation after cardiac surgery can also occur in patients
with silent pre-operative cerebral embolisms, with similar frequency as
in patients with overt neurological deficits. Unfortunately, these events
cannot currently be accurately predicted prior to surgery. When haem-­
orrhagic transformation occurs, it is associated with high mortality
(40%) and may require rescue neurointerventional or neurosurgical
treatment to control bleeding or allow cerebral decompression by
means of craniectomy. [577][,][580]

Several retrospective studies report benefits of early surgery (with-­
in 2 weeks) after haemorrhagic stroke without further compromising


neurological outcomes. [574][,][581][,][582] Decisions should be taken on a
case-by-case basis by the Endocarditis Team, including a neurologist,
and should be adapted to the mechanism of intracranial haemorrhage
and its severity including intracranial haemorrhage volume measure-­
ment and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale Score (NIHSS)
score (see *Figure 11* ). [495] In patients in whom surgery is delayed, re-­
peat CT or MRI imaging should be performed 1–2 weeks following
intracranial haemorrhage (or earlier in the case of clinical deterior-­
ation) in order to assess stability of the cerebral finding and potential-­
ly re-assess timing of surgery. The timing of surgery after intracranial
haemorrhage is controversial and an area where further evidence is
urgently required.

**10.5. Post-operative complications**
Post-operative management of patients with IE may be challenging due
to pre-operative multiorgan involvement and often complex surgical
procedures. The risk of in-hospital mortality associated with IE surgery
remains high (10–20%), particularly in patients >75 years of age, usually
due to co-morbidities and complications of IE. Further research should
focus on methods to lower surgical mortality.

The most frequent serious post-operative complications are coagu-­
lopathy requiring extensive use of blood products and clotting factors,
re-exploration of the thorax due to bleeding/tamponade, haemodialy-­
sis, stroke, or cerebral haemorrhagic transformation of prior cerebro-­
vascular lesions, low cardiac output syndrome, respiratory
complications and tracheostomy, prolonged hospital stay, and need
for a permanent pacemaker. [515][,][585][,][586] When mortality occurs, the
cause of death is often multifactorial. Post-mortem examination is help-­
ful for determining the cause of death, further understanding of disease
process, teaching purposes at academic environments, and quality

control.

**3998** ESC Guidelines


**10.6. Management of antithrombotic**
**therapy after surgery**
The management of antithrombotic therapy early after surgery for IE
may need to be altered when compared with non-IE clinical scenarios
(see also *Section 12.10* ). [128] This is mainly due to known increased risk of
intracranial haemorrhage after cerebral embolism. Restrictive or tai-­
lored use of antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents after surgery are
key to avoid further complications, [203][,][587] which is more feasible in pa-­
tients who received bioprosthetic valve prostheses or valve repair op-­
erations than after mechanical valve replacement surgery.
#### **11. Outcome after discharge: ** **follow-up and long-term prognosis**

Following in-hospital treatment, patients should be followed-up for the
occurrence of main post-discharge complications, including recurrence
of infection, HF, need for valve surgery or additional intervention,
stroke, need for renal replacement therapy, psychological complica-­
tions, and death. [86][,][588][,][589]

**11.1. Recurrences: relapses and**
**reinfections**

The risk of recurrence (which includes relapses and reinfections) among
survivors of IE varies significantly between studies, ranging from 2% to
9% in more contemporary analyses. [86][,][589][–][595] However, it has been shown
that reinfections have worse outcomes as compared with relapses. [592]

*Figure 12* illustrates the diagnostic paths to differentiate relapse from
reinfection. [596]


Conceptually, relapse refers to a repeat episode of IE caused by the
same microorganism and represents a failure of treatment due to insuf-­
ficient duration of initial treatment, sub-optimal choice of initial antibio-­
tics, or a persistent focus of infection. [592] Conversely, reinfection is
related to patients’ clinical and immunological profiles, describes an in-­
fection caused by a different microorganism usually more than 6
months after the initial episode, [4][,][596] and is associated with worse out-­
come. [592] The differentiation between relapse and reinfection needs to
be interpreted with caution, however, as a long time period from initial
infection suggests reinfection even in the presence of the same strain.
Contemporary data report low rates of relapse, [86] most probably re-­
flecting improved management of these patients. Relapse should be
treated with i.v. antibiotics for an additional 4–6 weeks, depending on
the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility, and cardiac
surgery should be considered. It is also important to consider that anti-­
biotic resistance may develop over time. Factors associated with an in-­
creased rate of relapse are listed in *Table 13* . [588][,][595][,][597]

In surgically managed NVE, the risk of IE recurrence is no different
when comparing valve replacement and valve repair. [84][,][598] Several pre-­
vious studies have also reported no difference regarding the risk of re-­
current IE between types of valve implanted. [599][–][601] However, the most
recent Danish registry study reports increased risk of IE recurrence as-­
sociated with biological vs. mechanical prostheses. [84]

Partial oral vs. i.v. antibiotic treatment of IE, as well as OPAT vs.
hospital-based antibiotic treatment in select stable patients, is not asso-­
ciated with an increased risk of recurrent IE. [43][,][396][,][399][,][602] Notably, re-­
sidual vegetation after treatment for IE also did not show increased
association with recurrence of IE, [602] although this result should be in-­
terpreted with caution. Patients with relapse or reinfection IE should
be managed as indicated in *Sections 7* and *8* (if complicated IE).

preventive dentistry, and advice about skin hygiene, including advice on
tattoos and skin piercing, are mandatory. Deficiencies in dental surveil-­
lance contribute to the continuous gradual increase in the incidence of
IE, which underlines the need for repeating the principles of IE preven-­
tion at each follow-up visit. In PWID patients, follow-up care should in-­
clude a strategy for addiction treatment, involve relevant addiction
specialists before hospital discharge, and possibly including medication
for opioid-use disorder. [606][,][607]

Recommendation Table 18 **— Recommendations for**
**post-discharge follow-up**


















**11.2. First year follow-up**
Patients discharged after the first episode of IE should remain under
close surveillance for potential long-term complications. A partnership
between cardiologists, infectious disease specialists, cardiac surgeons,
general practitioners, and dentists is encouraged to improve patient
care and reinforce prophylaxis measures. In medically treated patients,
residual valve dysfunction may worsen, or structural valve deterioration
may progress, despite bacteriological cure. To monitor the risk of de-­
velopment of secondary HF, an initial clinical evaluation and baseline
TTE should be performed at the completion of antimicrobial therapy
and repeated if a change in the clinical condition occurs.

Clinical re-assessment should be performed one or more times in
the first year and yearly thereafter depending on the individual risk pro-­
file. The need for late valve surgery is relatively low, ranging from 3% to
11%. [27][,][588][,][592] Blood testing for inflammatory markers (i.e. WBC,
C-reactive protein, procalcitonin) should be performed early after fin-­
ishing antimicrobial treatment and repeated thereafter when clinically
indicated. [592] Due to the increased risk of relapse for virulent microor-­
ganisms, blood cultures are encouraged within the first week after fin-­
ishing treatment.

The early period after discharge might be challenged by slow physical
and mental recovery. [603][,][604] Patients’ and families’ concerns should be
addressed during follow-up. Supporting the family may indirectly sup-­
port the patient during recovery and reduce the psychological burden.
Cardiac rehabilitation, including physical exercise training and patient
education, may be beneficial, and has been shown to be safe and feasible
in stable patients at a minimum of 2 weeks after surgery for left-sided
IE. [605] Physical training should start as early as possible and can be
adapted post-sternotomy with isolated lower-limb training.
Adherence is improved if the delay to training is minimized, and rebuild-­
ing muscle mass and reducing frailty should be a priority.

Patients, and their caregivers, should be informed of their risk of IE
recurrence and be educated on preventive measures and selfmonitoring. In particular, patients should be educated that new onset
of fever, chills, or other signs of infection mandate immediate evalu-­
ation, including procurement of blood cultures before empirical use
of antibiotics, and that contact with the Heart Valve Centre is manda-­
tory in case of suspected recurrent IE. Good oral health maintenance,

**11.3. Long-term prognosis**
Contemporary long-term survival rates after the completion of IE
treatment are estimated to be ∼85–90% and 70–80% at 1 and 5 years,
respectively. [589][,][592][–][594][,][610][,][611] Impact of referral bias, however, should
be taken into consideration. [612] The main predictors of long-term
mortality are age, co-morbidities, PWID, double valve infection, recur-­
rences of IE, and HF, especially when cardiac surgery cannot be per-­
formed. [588][,][589][,][592][,][593][,][613] Compared with an age- and sex-matched
general population, patients that survived a first episode of IE have sig-­
nificantly worse survival when suffering relapses or reinfections. [589][,][614]

This excess mortality is especially high within the first few years after
hospital discharge and can be explained by late complications such as
HF, risk of recurrences, and higher patient vulnerability. [589][,][611] In fact,
most recurrences of IE and late cardiac surgeries occurred during this
period of time. [589][,][592][,][611]
#### **12. Management of specific ** **situations**

**12.1. Prosthetic valve endocarditis**

Prosthetic valve endocarditis is the most severe form of IE and occurs in
1–6% of patients with valve prostheses, [615] with an incidence of
0.3–1.2% per patient-year. [5][,][420][,][616][,][617] PVE accounts for 20–30% of all
cases of IE, [618] and may be more common after biological than after
mechanical valve replacement surgery. [619][,][620] PVE was observed in
21% of cases of IE in a French survey, [618] in 26% of cases in the Euro
Heart Survey, [419] and in 20% of cases in the ICE-PCS. [621] Real-world


**4000** ESC Guidelines


observational studies demonstrated stable rates of IE, but a remarkable
increase in PVE between 1998 and 2013. [80] Recently, a further increase
in PVE cases (31%) was observed in the EURO-ENDO registry. [5] PVE is
still associated with difficulties in diagnosis, determination of the opti-­
mal therapeutic strategy, and poor prognosis.

**12.1.1. Definition and pathophysiology**
A distinction is commonly made between early PVE and late PVE based
on the time since valve surgery, because of significant differences in the
microbiological profiles between these two groups. [622] However, the
time to IE onset is prognostically less important than the connection
of IE to the peri-operative period or to specific pathogens. Prosthetic
valve endocarditis with an onset in the peri-operative period involves
mainly *S. aureus*, *Staphylococcus epidermidis*, or nosocomial microorgan-­
isms, such as Gram-negative pathogens or fungi. Late PVE more com-­
monly mimics the pattern of NVE, which is mostly represented by
streptococcal and staphylococcal infections. [623] *S. aureus* is more com-­
monly observed in patients with mechanical valves, while alphahaemolytic streptococci, enterococci, and CoNS are more common
in patients with bioprosthetic valves. [624] PVE due to *Mycobacterium chi-­*
*maera* is an uncommon form of nosocomial infection that can result

from contaminated CPB heater-cooler systems. Such infections pre-­
sent many months after the index operation and can therefore be chal-­
lenging to identify, and are associated with high mortality. [625]

The pathogenesis of PVE differs according to both the type of con-­
[tamination and the type of prosthetic valve (see Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)
online, *[Section S6.1](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)* ).

**12.1.2. Diagnosis**
Diagnosis is more difficult in PVE than in NVE. Clinical presentation is
frequently atypical, particularly in the early post-operative period, in
which fever and inflammatory syndromes are common in the absence
of macroscopic alterations of the prosthesis on cardiac imaging.
However, persistent fever should trigger the suspicion of PVE. As in
NVE, diagnosis of PVE is based mainly on the results of echocardiog-­
raphy and blood cultures. However, both are associated with a sensitiv-­
ity of only 60% for the definite diagnosis of endocarditis. [212]

Although TOE is mandatory in suspected PVE ( *Figure 6* ), its diagnos-­
tic value is lower than in NVE. Identification of a new periprosthetic leak
is a major criterion of IE and urges additional imaging modality to con-­
firm the diagnosis (see *Section 5* ). [533][,][626] Recently, nuclear techniques,
particularly [18F]FDG-PET/CT, have been shown to improve the diag-­
nostic accuracy of the Duke criteria and increase sensitivity. [34][,][209]

Combinations of different imaging techniques such as cardiac CT, nu-­
clear imaging, and TOE, improve diagnostic accuracy and provide rele-­
vant information in terms of prognosis. [33][,][627] In select cases of
suspected PVE, and non-diagnostic results for the above-listed exams,
intracardiac echocardiography may be considered.

**12.1.3. Prognosis and treatment**

A high in-hospital mortality rate of 20–40% has been reported in
PVE. [628][,][629] Compared with NVE, PVE is associated with increased inhospital mortality and morbidity as well as reduced long-term sur-­
vival. [88][,][630] Several factors have been associated with poor prognosis
in PVE, including older age, diabetes mellitus, healthcare-associated in-­
fections, and early PVE. [312] Among the different causative organisms,
staphylococcal or fungal infection seem to be more aggressive, whereas
enterococcal infections are associated with similar mortality but higher
recurrence rates. [628] Haemodynamic instability, multivalvular


involvement as well as involvement of the aortomitral fibrosa have
been associated with worse outcomes. It is noteworthy that the
most important risk factor for recurrent IE and mortality is withholding
surgery despite an obvious indication. [5]

The best therapeutic option in PVE is still debated. Although surgery
is generally considered the best option when PVE causes severe pros-­
thetic dysfunction or HF, in the EURO-ENDO registry it was per-­
formed in only 73% of patients with PVE despite a clear indication
for surgical treatment. [5] In a single-series study of 523 PVE patients,
early surgery was a large independent predictor of early and 1-year sur-­
vival. [631] Conversely, after adjustment for differences in clinical charac-­
teristics and survival bias, early valve replacement was not associated
with lower mortality compared with medical therapy in a large inter-­
national cohort. [421] In this series, however, surgery was beneficial in
the subgroup of patients with the strongest indications for surgery in-­
cluding valve regurgitation, vegetation, and dehiscence or paravalvular
abscess/fistula formation. [421] Therefore, a surgical strategy is recom-­
mended for PVE in high-risk subgroups identified by prognostic assess-­
ment, i.e. PVE complicated with HF, severe prosthetic dysfunction,
abscess, or persistent fever. Conversely, patients with uncomplicated
non-staphylococcal late PVE can be managed conservatively. [632][–][634]

However, patients who are initially treated medically require close
follow-up because of the risk of late events and the higher risk of re-­
lapse or valvular dysfunction.

Surgery for PVE follows the general principles outlined for NVE.
However, the reoperation setting and the higher incidence of peripros-­
thetic tissue destruction increase the complexity of the procedure.
Meticulous and radical debridement of the infected material, including
the original prosthesis, suture, and pledgets, is recommended. The
type of valve substitute used for PVE follows the same recommenda-­
tions as for NVE (see also *Section 10.3.1* ).

Early PVE following valve replacement surgery is a separate entity as-­
sociated with a high mortality rate, where conservative treatment with
antibiotics is unlikely to lead to a cure and repeat surgery should be per-­
formed. [621][,][635] Staphylococci, Cutibacteria, or similar species are the
usual causative organisms. [622][,][636]

**12.2. Endocarditis in the elderly**
Characteristics of patients with IE have dramatically changed over re-­
cent decades, with an increasing prevalence and specific features of IE
in the elderly population. [25][,][145][,][637][,][638] In this population, enterococci
and *S. aureus* are reported to be the most frequent aetiological agents.
In addition, the higher presence of intracardiac prosthetic devices
(CIED and valvular prosthesis/repair including TAVI devices) and in-­
creased incidence of healthcare-associated IE episodes are ob-­
served. [25][,][637] Finally, a lower risk of embolic episodes has been
observed in this subgroup. [462][,][639][–][641]

ESC Guidelines **4001**


A number of studies have shown that cardiac surgery positively af-­
fects the clinical outcome of IE patients. Nevertheless, old age, comorbidities, and previous non-cardiac and cardiac procedures lead to
surgical hesitancy by referring physicians, surgeons, and patients them-­
selves. [642] Moreover, these characteristics also influence the outcome of
this fragile cohort. [400][,][433] As a result, less frequent performance of cura-­
tive surgery and increased mortality are typical hallmarks of IE episodes
in elderly as compared with the younger population. [640] In a recently
published Swedish propensity analysis of IE patients from 2006 to
2017, the authors found that surgery was underused in the elderly
and that 1-year mortality was significantly higher in elderly patients
who did not undergo surgery. [641] In a sub-analysis of the ESC EORP
EURO-ENDO registry, the indication for surgery was less often recog-­
nized (51% vs. 57%) and surgery was far less frequently performed
when indicated (35% vs. 68%) in patients >80 vs. <80 years.
However, mortality of surgically treated patients was remarkably simi-­
lar in patients <80 and >80 years after propensity matching (19.7% vs.
20.0%). Age was also not demonstrated to be an independent predictor
of mortality in this large prospective study. [640][,][643] These findings suggest
that performance of surgery in well-selected elderly patients is under-­
utilized and may increase their chance of survival.

In elderly IE patients, functional and nutritional status are important
predictors of outcomes. [400] When considering cardiac surgery in elderly
patients, functional and nutritional status, and their associated risks,
should be accurately explored through a comprehensive assessment
by geriatricians. In addition, the earliest possible discharge home to fa-­
cilitate the patient’s functional recovery should be considered in this
subgroup of patients.

**12.3. Transcatheter prosthetic valve**
**endocarditis**

**12.3.1. Endocarditis following transcatheter aortic**
**valve implantation**

The incidence of IE post-TAVI ranges from 0.3 to 1.9 per 100 patientyears, [94][,][623][,][644][–][648] which is similar to that reported following surgical
aortic valve replacement in both observational studies and
RCTs. [94][,][623][,][646][,][647] One recent study, however, reported a lower inci-­
dence of PVE after TAVI compared with surgical prostheses. [649] The
risk of IE is higher within the first year following the procedure, and par-­
ticularly within the initial 3 months. [644][,][645][,][648][,][650][–][652] A modest decrease
in the incidence of IE post-TAVI has been observed in recent years, par-­
ticularly in the early period following the procedure, presumably related
to multiple technical improvements, more streamlined procedures, and
a reduction of periprocedural complications. [650][,][652] A similar IE rate has
been reported irrespective of transcatheter valve type, [653] and predis-­
posing factors, including younger age, male gender, renal dysfunction,
and significant residual aortic regurgitation, have been identi-­
fied. [94][,][644][–][646][,][648][,][651][,][652]

*12.3.1.1. Diagnosis*
The diagnosis of IE post-TAVI is challenging. The stent frame of trans-­
catheter valves, with a much higher amount of metal surrounding the
valve leaflets compared with surgical prostheses, and the characteristics
of TAVI patients (frequently elderly with multiple co-morbidities) may
increase the diagnostic challenges in this population. The clinical presen-­
tation is frequently atypical, with fever lacking in 13–20% of pa-­
tients. [623][,][645][,][650] Enterococci and *S. aureus* are the two most common

microorganisms involved in IE post-TAVI, followed by streptococci
and CoNS. [644][–][646][,][650]

Some important aspects should be considered regarding TOE in pa-­
tients with suspected IE post-TAVI: (i) no vegetations are detected in


38–60% of cases; [623][,][645][,][650][,][651] (ii) vegetations are located in the stent
frame of the transcatheter valve (and not on the valve leaflets) in
12% of cases, and this rate increases up to 19% in the presence of
some self-expanding valve systems with a longer stent frame occupying
the ascending aorta; [653] and (iii) the vegetations are located outside the
transcatheter valve in about one-third of cases, mainly at the level of the
mitral valve. [645][,][650][,][651] Nuclear imaging or CT have been useful to diag-­
nose IE post-TAVI. [654][,][655] The addition of [18F]FDG-PET/CT and/or
CTA to the diagnostic work-up of IE in TAVI changed the final clinical
diagnosis in 33% of patients. [655] Intracardiac echocardiography may also
be useful for detecting vegetations in patients with suspected IE after
TAVI and negative TOE. [165]

*12.3.1.2. Prognosis and treatment*

Prognosis and treatment of post-TAVI PVE is complicated by the fact
that patients are older and have more co-morbidities than post-surgical
PVE patients. About two-thirds of patients with IE post-TAVI exhibit at
least one complication, with acute kidney injury and HF being the most
frequent adverse events. [645][,][646][,][656] The in-hospital and 30-day mortality
rates are very high, ranging from 16% to 36%, [623][,][644][–][647][,][657] and increase
up to 41–59% at 1-year follow-up. [644][,][645][,][652][,][657] A higher patient risk
profile, *S. aureus*, and the occurrence of IE complications have been
identified as risk factors for increased mortality. [645][,][652][,][657]

Antimicrobial therapy for IE post-TAVI is similar to that of PVE (see
*Section 7* ). Similar to surgical PVE, cardiac surgery is considered the best
option in the presence of IE complications, particularly severe prosthet-­
ic failure or HF, but is infrequently performed. Surgery is performed in
∼20% of cases (ranging from 3.8% to 31.3%), [645][,][652][,][656] a much lower
rate compared with NVE and surgical PVE. The characteristics of the
TAVI population, with often advanced age and high or prohibitive sur-­
gical risk, along with the potential difficulties associated with the re-­
moval of some transcatheter valve systems (particularly those with a
large amount of stent frame, frequently adherent to the ascending aorta
after a few months following the TAVI procedure) may play a role in the
low rate of surgical interventions.

To date, all studies but one failed to demonstrate the potential bene-­
fit of surgery in IE post-TAVI patients, [442][,][645][,][652][,][656][,][658] but the relatively
small sample size of the studies and the multiplicity of potential con-­
founders when comparing to those patients not receiving surgical treat-­
ment precludes definite conclusions. The only study showing a
beneficial effect of surgical intervention focused on those patients
who had a local extension of the infection (i.e. abscess or fistula). [442]

The decision to proceed with surgery in IE post-TAVI patients should
be individualized, balancing the surgical risks and the prognosis of med-­
ical treatment alone. In cases with local extension of the infection, sur-­
gery may be recommended in the absence of a prohibitive surgical risk.
In cases with healed IE and valve prosthesis dysfunction, repeat trans-­
catheter therapy (valve-in-valve procedure) can be performed in select
patients. [659] Such interventions should be performed at least 1–3
months after the healed endocarditis episode and following a negative
follow-up TOE.

**12.3.2. Endocarditis following transcatheter**
**pulmonary valve implantation**

The incidence of IE post-transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation
(TPVI) ranges from 1.6 to 4.0 per 100 patient-years, [93][,][660][–][667] which
seems to be higher than that reported following surgical pulmonary
valve interventions (observational studies, no randomized
data). [662][,][663][,][667][,][668] While some studies suggest a higher risk associated
with the use of bovine jugular vein valves, [662][,][667][,][669] a recent large multi-­
centre study including different transcatheter valve systems did not

**4002** ESC Guidelines


observe differences between valve types. [665] The most consistent fac-­
tors associated with an increased risk of IE following TPVI have been
younger age, a previous history of IE, and a higher transvalvular residual
gradient. [93][,][663][,][665]

*12.3.2.1. Diagnosis*

The diagnosis of IE in TPVI recipients may be challenging, and the use of
intracardiac echocardiography and [18F]FDG-PET/CT has been shown
to be useful in cases with a clinical suspicion and negative TTE/
TOE. [34][,][93][,][210][,][660][,][665][,][670] *S. aureus* and oral group streptococci species
are the most common microorganisms causing IE post-TPVI. [660][,][664][–][666]

*12.3.2.2. Prognosis and treatment*

New moderate or severe prosthetic valve stenosis occurs much more
frequently (one-third to one-half of patients) in post-TPVI PVE than in
aortic PVE, and the rate of surgical valve replacement therapy ranges
from 26% to 56%. [93][,][660][,][661][,][664][,][665] The possibility of a transcatheter
therapy (valve-in-valve intervention) for treating severe prosthesis dys-­
function in cases with healed endocarditis or as an urgent treatment
(balloon dilatation) in severe valve stenosis cases has also been re-­
ported. [660][,][665] A valve-in-valve intervention should be delayed at least
1–3 months following antibiotic treatment of the endocarditis episode.
The mortality rate related to the IE episode ranges from 0% to
11%. [93][,][660][,][661][,][664][,][665] This rate is much lower compared with TAVI pa-­
tients, which is likely to be related to the younger and less co-morbid
characteristics of the TPVI population.

**12.4. Infective endocarditis affecting**
**cardiac implantable electronic devices**
Device-related infection is one of the most serious complications of
CIED therapy and is associated with significant mortality and
morbidity. [671]

**12.4.1. Definitions of cardiac device infections**
A recent EHRA consensus document has published criteria for CIED
infection. [130] Localized infections may be either superficial incisional in-­
fections (acute infection without involvement of the pocket or hard-­
ware) or isolated pocket infections (limited to the hardware in the
pocket), and can be either acute or chronic. Systemic CIED infections
may occur with or without pocket infection, and with or without visible
vegetations on the tricuspid or pulmonary valves or pacing leads.
Cardiovascular implanted electronic device-related IE is defined as evi-­
dence of CIED infection with clinical signs of pocket infection and/or
imaging findings (lead vegetations, positive FDG-PET on the gener-­
ator/leads etc.) which fulfil the criteria for valvular IE (see *Section 5* ).

**12.4.2. Pathophysiology and microbiology**

Cardiovascular implanted electronic device-related IE occurs by two
mechanisms. Local infection usually results from bacterial flora from
the patient’s skin that is introduced into the pocket at the time of inci-­
sion despite surgical preparation. [672] Seeding via bacteraemia from a dis-­
tant focus is less frequent. [673][–][676]

Whereas CoNS are most frequently the cause of chronic pocket in-­
fection, the most frequent agents identified with bacteraemia in CIED in-­
fection are *S. aureus* and CoNS. [677][,][678] Other causative organisms are
*Enterococcus* spp., β-haemolytic streptococci, oral streptococci group,
*Cutibacterium acnes*, and *Corynebacterium* spp. [674][,][678][,][679] More rarely, sys-­
temic infection is caused by Gram-negative (mainly *P. aeruginosa* or
*Serratia marcescens* ) [680] or polymicrobial agents, whereas systemic fungal
infections ( *Candida* spp. and *Aspergillus* spp.) [681] are exceptional.


**12.4.3. Risk factors**

Risk factors may be divided into patient-related, procedure-related, and
device-related factors. [118] The PADIT (Previous procedure on same
pocket; Age; Depressed renal function; Immunocompromised; Type
of procedure) study randomized 19 603 patients undergoing CIED im-­
plantation to conventional treatment (pre-procedural cefazolin infu-­
sion) vs. different regimens of incremental treatment. [682] The primary
outcome was 1-year hospitalization for device infection which was
not significantly different between groups. A risk score for infection
has been derived from the study (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)
*[Table S11](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad193#supplementary-data)* ) [683] and has been validated externally. [684] A web-based calcu-­
[lator is available (https://padit-calculator.ca).](https://padit-calculator.ca) [683]

**12.4.4. Prophylaxis**

Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent CIED-related IE before interventions,
such as dental, respiratory, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary proce-­
dures, is not warranted as the risk is very low.

Prevention of CIED infection at implantation hinges upon careful
planning, pre-operative antibiotic prophylaxis, correction of modifiable
risk factors, hygienic surgical environment and technique, ancillary mea-­
sures in case of increased risk (e.g. use of an antibacterial envelope), and
proper post-operative care.

Correction of modifiable risk factors includes general measures such
as postponing the procedure in cases of fever or signs of infection and
avoiding temporary pacing. Routine administration of prophylactic sys-­
temic antibiotics within 1 h of incision is the standard of care. [118] RCTs
have used flucloxacillin (1–2 g i.v.) [117] and first-generation cephalospor-­
ins, such as cefazolin (1–2 g i.v.). [116] Vancomycin (1–2 g over 60–90 min)
may be used in case of allergy to cephalosporins with other alternatives,
including teicoplanin and clindamycin. [117] Coverage of MRSA should be
guided by the prevalence in the implanting institution.

Haematoma is a major contributor to risk of infection, and all possible
measures should be taken to avoid this complication. [685][,][686] Another
major risk factor is a revision with re-opening of the pocket (e.g. for
lead repositioning). Technical aspects have recently been covered in de-­
tail in an EHRA consensus document on CIED implantation. [687]

It is generally not recommended to wash the pocket with antibiotics,
nor to administer antibiotic treatment post-operatively, as shown by
the PADIT trial. [682] An antibiotic mesh envelope, which locally releases
minocycline and rifampin for a minimum of 7 days and is fully absorbed
in ∼9 weeks, may, however, be useful to reduce risk of infection in se-­
lected patients. The Worldwide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope
Infection Prevention Trial (WRAP-IT) showed that the mesh envelope
significantly reduces the incidence of CIED infection in patients at in-­
creased risk (i.e. undergoing a pocket revision, generator replacement,
system upgrade, or implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy

[CRT]-implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD]). [688] The number
needed to treat was, however, high at 200, but is ∼50 in patients under-­
going CRT reoperations (replacement/upgrade/revision) in a recent
observational study. [689]

**12.4.5. Diagnosis**

Clinical presentation of CIED-associated IE is similar to valvular IE with
patients frequently presenting with fever, chills, and embolic events.
Signs of pocket infection (swelling, tenderness, erythema, purulent dis-­
charge etc.) may or may not be present.

The probability that a positive blood culture in a CIED recipient re-­
presents underlying device infection depends on the organism type and
duration of bacteraemia. Suspicion of CIED-associated IE should be
particularly high in the event of *S. aureus* bacteraemia. [675] CIED infection
is less likely with Gram-negative bacteraemia, and in these instances, the
pocket usually shows signs of infection. [680][,][690][,][691]

**4004** ESC Guidelines


Transthoracic echocardiography and TOE are both recommended
in the case of suspected CIED-related IE. [692][–][694] Intracardiac echocardi-­
ography may also be used to visualize vegetations, [695] and may be useful
in patients in whom TOE is not possible. However, the absence of ve-­
getations does not rule out IE, as these may be present on extracardiac
segments of the lead which cannot be visualized. Repeating TTE and/or
TOE within 5–7 days is recommended in case of initially negative exam-­
ination when clinical suspicion of CIED-related IE remains high. It is im-­
portant to note that fibrinous lead masses may be observed in
asymptomatic CIED patients, and do not predict CIED-related IE
over long-term follow-up. [696]

Diagnosis of CIED-related endocarditis by [18]FDG-PET/CT has
good sensitivity and specificity, [129] and is particularly useful in the setting
of possible CIED-related IE without signs of pocket infection. [238] Results
should be interpreted with caution, however, if the CIED is recently im-­
planted (<6 weeks). [130]

White blood cell SPECT/CT has also been used for diagnosing CIED
infection but has limited availability. [216][,][697] A chest X-ray or CT should
be performed in all patients to evaluate the presence of pulmonary
complications.

**12.4.6. Antimicrobial therapy**
Treatment of CIED infection involves early [698][,][699] and complete removal of
all parts of the system, combined with initial empirical antibiotic therapy
directed at MRSA and Gram-negative bacteria, while awaiting identification
of the pathogen. [130][,][700][,][701] Antibiotic treatment follows the recommenda-­
tions indicated in *Section 7* . In exceptional cases where complete device re-­
moval is not possible, i.v. antibiotics for 4–6 weeks may be administered
followed by close follow-up after interruption of antibiotic therapy or, al-­
ternatively, individualized long-term suppressive oral therapy.

**12.4.7. Device extraction**

When CIED and lead extraction is required, such procedures should be
performed in centres with the corresponding expertise. Complete
CIED removal is recommended for all patients with confirmed infection
of the lead(s), as conservative treatment is associated with increased mor-­
tality. [678][,][699] In patients with left-sided prosthetic heart valves and CIED in-­
fection, complete CIED removal combined with prolonged (4–)6 week
antibiotic therapy may prevent left-sided valve infection. [130][,][702] Complete

CIED extraction should also be considered in case of valvular IE without

definite lead involvement, taking into account the identified pathogens
( *Staphylococcus* spp. infections may be more prone to seed the
CIED), [673][,][675][,][676] procedural risk, and indication for valve surgery.

Complete device extraction should be considered even in the absence
of vegetations in the setting of persistent or relapsing Gram-positive bac-­
teraemia or fungaemia after a course of appropriate antibiotic therapy, if
there is no other identified source (see *Figure 13* ). [681] In all instances of
lead extraction, procedural risk should be carefully evaluated taking into ac-­
count lead dwell time, pacemaker dependency, patient frailty, and other
co-morbidities within the process of shared decision-making. [703]

Lead extraction should be performed, without delay (i.e. within the
first days of admission), as this has been shown to be associated with
improved outcomes. [698][,][699][,][704] Percutaneous rather than surgical ex-­
traction is the preferred procedure, but requires specialized tools
and should be performed in centres with expertise in this technique
and with onsite surgical backup, due to the risk of life-threatening tam-­
ponade and vein laceration.

Large vegetations may be aspirated percutaneously before lead extrac-­
tion to reduce risk associated with embolization. [705] Surgical lead


extraction should be considered in case of large vegetations (e.g.
>20 mm) [679] and if aspiration is not available or is unsuccessful. Surgical re-­
moval is also the preferred technique if valve surgery is indicated.
Hardware retrieved from extraction, especially the lead tip, should be cul-­
tured. [706] Sonication has been shown to increase diagnostic yield. [707][,][708]

**12.4.8. Device reimplantation**

The indication for reimplantation should always be carefully evaluated
and no part of the removed CIED system should be reimplanted.
Quality of evidence regarding timing of reimplantation is poor. [709]

Reimplantation should be performed at a site distant from that of the
previous generator, and delayed until signs and symptoms of local
and systemic infection have resolved and blood cultures are negative
for at least 72 h after extraction in the absence of vegetations or
‘ghosts’ (fibrous remnants after lead extraction, which have been asso-­
ciated with death and reinfection), [710] or after 2 weeks of negative blood
cultures if vegetations were visualized. [701][,][711]

For patients with a high risk of sudden cardiac death, a wearable defib-­
rillator is an option as a bridge to reimplantation. In pacemaker-dependent
patients, an active-fixation lead may be introduced via the internal jugular
vein and connected to an external pacemaker for up to 4–6 weeks, thereby
preserving the contralateral side for definitive device reimplantation. [712] As
an alternative to delayed reimplantation in pacemaker-dependent patients,
an epicardial pacemaker may be implanted before lead extraction,
although this strategy has been associated with a higher risk of device
re-intervention. [713] Alternative devices such as leadless pacemakers [714] or
subcutaneous ICD [715] may be implanted in selected patients if the risk of
new infection is deemed high.

**12.5. Infective endocarditis in patients**
**admitted to intensive care units**

Infective endocarditis is frequently associated with severe life-threatening
cardiac and/or systemic complications and the number of patients requir-­
ing intensive care unit (ICU) admission has steadily been growing in recent
years, as shown in a large retrospective study. [716] The need for ICU admis-­
sion, advanced monitoring, vasoactive treatment, and organ support is
most commonly prompted by the occurrence of septic shock, acute HF,
and cardiogenic shock leading to multiorgan failure. Moreover, in recent
years, an increase in healthcare-associated IE, usually of staphylococcal ori-­
gin, predominantly in older patients with an increased number of comorbidities, and more likely to lead to critical illness, has also been re-­
ported. [29][,][717][–][719] Any IE patient requiring ICU admission should be urgently

discussed within the Endocarditis Team.

In the largest multicentre retrospective series, focusing on critically
ill IE patients with organ failure requiring ICU admission in France over
an 18-year period, overall in-hospital mortality was 32%. [716]

Multivariate analysis showed age, Simplified Acute Physiology Score
(SAPS) II score, organ failure, stroke, and *Staphylococcus* spp. to be as-­
sociated with an increased risk of death. In contrast, cardiac surgery,
CIED, male gender, and *Streptococcus* spp. as the causative micro-­
organism of IE, were associated with a better survival. [716] In another


study that reported an even higher mortality (42%), four independent
prognostic factors were identified: high SAPS II (>35 points) and
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (>8 points) scores, MRSA infec-­
tion, and native valve IE. [718]

Right-sided IE, which is more commonly associated with PWID, ac-­
counts for <10% of IE cases but is associated with high mortality in pa-­
tients needing ICU admission. [717]

**12.5.1. Causative microorganisms**

The majority of retrospective series in the ICU setting point to
*Staphylococcus* spp. as the main causative agent of IE episodes. Indeed,
*S. aureus* has emerged as the most feared aetiological agent with the
highest rates of complications and mortality, being responsible for up
to 56% of IE cases in one observational study. [719] *Streptococcus* spp.,
*Enterococcus* spp., Gram-negative bacilli, and *Candida* spp. are less fre-­
quently reported. [718][,][719] Identification of the infecting microorganism
remains the mainstay of effective therapy in complicated IE cases.
Hence, in patients with negative blood cultures, serological or molecu-­
lar testing by PCR should be considered (see *Section 5.3* ).

**12.5.2. Diagnosis**
The diverse nature, epidemiological profile, and presentation pheno-­
type of IE in the ICU setting may hinder early diagnosis. In particular,
pyrexial episodes suggestive of an alternative infective source and
neurological manifestations, such as confusion, delirium, or focal symp-­
toms may initially mislead the clinician from a diagnosis of IE.

The diagnosis of IE in ICUs follows the same modified criteria as in
non-ICU patients (see *Section 5* ). Transoesophageal echocardiography
has a prominent role as a tool for diagnosis of IE and its complications in
the ICU. [720]

**12.5.3. Management**

Antimicrobial therapy and indications for surgery in patients with IE are
described in *Sections 7* and *10*, respectively. Surgical therapy has been
associated with an improved early and late outcome both in the general
population and in patients admitted to ICUs. Although surgery is the
treatment of choice in about one-half of patients, surgical therapy in
ICU patients is characterized by more complex procedures with in-­
creased peri-operative mortality, as well as difficult post-operative
care due to higher requirements of circulatory and pulmonary support.
Five independent predictors of post-operative need for advanced circu-­
latory support were found in one study of patients with IE: male sex,
increased surgery duration, renal dysfunction (pre-operative estimated
glomerular filtration <60 mL/min/m [2] ), HF prior to surgery, and lower
pre-operative platelet count. [721]

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is occasionally required in
patients post-surgery but is associated with poor outcomes. [722]

Decision-making in ICU patients with IE should always be a product of
consensus of the Endocarditis Team to determine the best management
strategy. Pre-operative haemodynamic optimization and goal-directed
therapy protocols including vasoactive drugs and mechanical circulatory
support may be considered in these complex high-risk patients. [721]

**12.6. Right-sided infective endocarditis**
Right-sided IE accounts for ∼5–10% of patients with IE, [723] but its fre-­
quency may be increasing as its risk factors are increasing in some coun-­
tries. [133][,][724] Risk factors for right-sided IE include patients with CHD,
indwelling catheters, and CIED, as well as immunocompromised and
PWID patients. Of these, PWID is an increasingly common risk

**4006** ESC Guidelines


factor, [133][,][723] while patients with indwelling vascular catheters have the
worst prognosis. [725] IE of transcatheter pulmonary valves is covered in
*Section 12.2*, whereas CIED-related right-sided IE is covered in *Section 12.3* .

The most common microorganism causing right-sided IE is *S. aureus*,
accounting for the majority of patients. [723][,][726] The tricuspid valve is
much more commonly infected than the pulmonary valve in patients
with right-sided IE. [723][,][727] Right-sided IE may also involve non-functional
embryonic remnants of the right atrium (e.g. Eustachian valve). [723][,][727]

Right-sided IE rarely spreads to involve the left-sided cardiac structures,
whereas spread from left- to right-sided structures is not
uncommon. [728]

**12.6.1. Diagnosis and complications**

Right-sided IE patients present with fever, bacteraemia, and pulmonary
complaints (i.e. cough, chest pain, or haemoptysis). Right-sided HF may
also occur due to tricuspid or pulmonary regurgitation, or to pulmon-­
ary hypertension induced by multiple pulmonary septic emboli. [133]

Diagnosis is most frequently confirmed by echocardiographic findings of
vegetations on the tricuspid valve or, less frequently, pulmonary valve.
Adequate evaluation of the tricuspid valve may be performed with TTE,
due to the anterior location of the valve and the large vegetations frequent-­
ly observed in right-sided IE. Transoesophageal echocardiography is fre-­
quently required, however, particularly for evaluation of the pulmonary
valve or in patients with indwelling venous catheters or intracardiac de-­
vices. [729] Intracardiac echocardiography may also be helpful in select pa-­
tients. Vegetations may be challenging to identify on the pulmonary valve
even with TOE, especially in patients with a prosthetic valve in the pulmon-­
ary position. [18]FDG-PET imaging may be very helpful in such pa-­
tients. [34][,][730] Perivalvular abscess formation and invasion into surrounding
structures is rarely seen in right-sided IE, unless it is a secondary conse-­
quence of left-sided IE. [728] CT is useful in order to identify concomitant pul-­
monary disease, including infarcts and abscess formation.

**12.6.2. Endocarditis in people who inject drugs**
Infective endocarditis in PWID is an increasing global phenom-­
enon. [10][,][132][,][133][,][141] Repeat i.v. injections result in contaminated particles
that reach the tricuspid valve and right-heart chambers and can also
lead to infection of left-heart structures, which is associated with worse
prognosis. [614] PWID patients also have an increased rate of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis than other patients with
right-sided IE. [731] The majority of right-sided IE in PWID can be treated
successfully with antibiotic therapy. Mortality rates of PWID are rela-­
tively low, even when surgery is required, probably due to the young
patient age. [723] However, PWID have a markedly increased rate of IE
recurrence, particularly in the first 6 months post-surgery. [133][,][614][,][723][,][732]

**12.6.3. Prognosis and treatment**

Right-sided IE is generally a more benign clinical entity than left-sided IE
and can be medically managed in ∼90% of patients, with surgery re-­
served for those who fail medical therapy. [733] Patients with
CIED-related right-sided IE have a worse prognosis as compared
with non-CIED-related right-sided IE (see *Section 12.4* ). [723] 725

Right-sided IE in immunocompromised patients, particularly fungal in-­
fections, carries a very poor prognosis.

*12.6.3.1. Antimicrobial therapy*

*S. aureus* and CoNS are the cause of right-sided IE in a large proportion
of cases, with *S. aureus* predominating in PWID and CoNS being more
common in patients with indwelling devices. [723][,][726] MRSA rates may be


increasing over time, particularly in PWID. [133] Right-sided IE due to
*Streptococcus* spp. is unusual but can be observed in alcoholics and dia-­
betics. *P. aeruginosa* and other Gram-negative organisms are rare causes
of right-sided IE, while *Candida albicans* is mostly seen in immunocom-­
promised patients.

Empirical antimicrobial therapy depends on the suspected micro-­
organism, the type of drug and solvent used by the PWID, and the in-­
fection location, [734] but *S. aureus* must be initially covered in all cases.
Initial treatment consists of penicillinase-resistant penicillin, vancomy-­
cin, or daptomycin, depending on the local prevalence of MRSA, [735] in
combination with gentamicin. If the patient is a pentazocine addict, an
anti- *Pseudomonas* agent may also be required, as the use of recreational
drugs may also entail infections with Gram-negative bacteria. [735] Very
large vegetations and history of brown heroin use dissolved in lemon
juice suggest infection for *Candida* spp. (not *C. albicans* ), and therefore
antifungal treatment should be added. [736] Antifungals may be necessary
in selected PWID, particularly if immunocompromised. [737]

Once the causative organisms have been isolated, therapy has to be
adjusted. An RCT demonstrated that a 2-week treatment course may
be sufficient and that aminoglycosides may be unnecessary. [738 717]

Two-week treatment with oxacillin (or cloxacillin) without gentamicin

is effective when:

(i) MSSA is the causative organism;
(ii) There is good clinical and microbiological response to treatment
(>96 h); [739]

(iii) The vegetation size is ≤20 mm; and
(iv) There is an absence of metastatic sites of infection or empyema
and cardiac or extracardiac complications, [739][,][740] prosthetic valve
or left-sided valve infection, [741] and severe immunosuppression. [742]

Glycopeptides (vancomycin) should not be used in a 2-week treatment.
The standard 4–6-week regimen should be used in the remaining patients
or when therapy with antibiotics other than penicillinase-resistant penicil-­
lins are used. [330][,][739][–][744] When the conventional i.v. route therapy is not
possible, *S. aureus* right-sided IE in PWID may also be treated with oral ci-­
profloxacin (750 mg twice a day) plus rifampin (300 mg twice a day) if the
strain is susceptible to both drugs, the case is uncomplicated, and patient
adherence is monitored carefully. [745] Partial oral antibiotic treatment
may also be beneficial for PWID with IE. [746]

For organisms other than *S. aureus*, therapy in PWID does not differ
from that in other patients.

*12.6.3.2. Surgery*

The commonly accepted indications for surgical treatment of rightsided IE in patients who are receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy
are (see Recommendation Table 19):

- Persistent bacteraemia after at least 1 week of appropriate antibiotic
therapy. [10]

- Tight ventricular dysfunction secondary to acute severe tricuspid re-­

gurgitation non-responsive to diuretics. [479]

- Respiratory insufficiency requiring ventilatory support after recur-­

rent pulmonary emboli. [747]

- Involvement of left-sided structures; [748][,][749] and

- Large residual tricuspid vegetations (>20 mm) after recurrent pul-­

monary emboli. [145][,][471]

Patients should be individually assessed by the Endocarditis Team. An
isolated vegetation is not an indication for surgery. Patients with

ESC Guidelines **4007**


residual large vegetations frequently present with right-heart and/or re-­
spiratory failure, as well as persistent sepsis. [750]

The common surgical strategies for tricuspid valve IE include valve re-­
pair, replacement and, less commonly, surgical valvectomy. [751] Tricuspid
valve repair is more frequently performed than valve replacement in
right-sided IE, although the extent of valve destruction may make repair
impossible. [725][,][752] Tricuspid valve repair may also be associated with
better short- and long-term outcomes than replacement for right-sided
IE, particularly with regards to recurrent infection and need for repeat
surgery. [479][,][723]

When valve replacement for right-sided IE is required, bioprostheses
are frequently preferred due to concerns with the management and
risks of lifelong anticoagulation, especially in PWID, and the risks of
thrombo-embolism for mechanical valves in the right heart. [726]

Prophylactic placement of permanent epicardial leads should be per-­
formed at the time of tricuspid valve surgery for right-sided IE, particu-­
larly if heart block is present in the operating room to prevent damage
of a replaced valve during subsequent transvenous lead displacement
and to lower the risk of reinfection. [733]

Recently, interest has been generated in the extraction of large vege-­
tations using percutaneous extracorporeal circuitry for aspiration. [753]

The main goals have been debulking of septic intracardiac masses, redu-­
cing the infectious load, and achieving clinical stability. [754]

Recommendation Table 21 **— Recommendations for**
**the** **surgical** **treatment** **of** **right-sided** **infective**
**endocarditis**

**Recommendations** **Class** **[a]** **Level** **[b]**

Surgery is recommended in patients with right-sided IE who are receiving

appropriate antibiotic therapy for the following scenarios:


**12.7. Infective endocarditis in congenital**
**heart disease**

Although the incidence of CHD is relatively constant, the overall popu-­
lation with CHD is constantly increasing due to increased survival fol-­
lowing CHD surgery in childhood and increased longevity of adults
with CHD. The presence of CHD, even after repair, is recognized as
a lifelong potential substrate for IE. Congenital heart disease predis-­
poses to IE via several mechanisms including turbulent non-laminar
blood flow causing shear stress and endothelial damage, the presence
of intracardiac foreign material such as prosthetic valves or CIED, cyan-­
osis, and recurrent exposure to cardiac procedures. [98]

There are marked variations in susceptibility to IE between CHD
lesions. Some simple conditions, such as secundum atrial septal defect,
patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary valve stenosis, carry a low risk
of IE, while others, such as bicuspid aortic valve carry a somewhat
increased risk. [8] However, CHD often presents with multiple cardiac
lesions, each adding to the total risk of IE. [8][,][756] In general terms, IE is
more common in CHD with multiple defects and in patients with
more complex CHD. [757]

Specific high-risk conditions are prosthetic valves, including transcath-­
eter valves, valve repair using a prosthetic ring, previous IE, any unre-­
paired cyanotic CHD, and any CHD repaired with prosthetic material
for up to 6 months after the procedure, or lifelong if residual shunt or
valvar regurgitation remains. [758] Contemporary studies confirm the rela-­
tively high risk of IE in CHD patients after valve surgery. [8][,][47][,][90][,][759] Specific
awareness is needed after TPVI (see *Section 12.3.2* ). [666][,][759][,][760]

The distribution of causative microorganisms does not differ from
the pattern found in acquired heart disease, with *Streptococcus* spp.
and *Staphylococcus* spp. being the most common strains. [98][,][757][,][761][,][762]

As in other groups, the diagnosis of IE is often made late, [757] highlighting
the need to consider the diagnosis of IE in any CHD patient presenting
with persisting fever or other signs of ongoing infection. Multiple blood
cultures are essential before starting antibiotic treatment. The principal
symptoms, complications, and basis for diagnosis do not differ from IE
in general. However, in CHD right-sided IE is more frequent than in
non-CHD-acquired cardiac disease.

Transthoracic echocardiography is sufficient in many cases to image
the infectious lesions and their complications. However, complex anat-­
omy and the presence of artificial material may reduce the rate of vege-­
tation detection and other features of IE, thus favouring the addition of
TOE, particularly in adults and larger children. Despite the improved
sensitivity of TOE for the detection of IE, TOE may only perform simi-­
larly to TTE for anterior structures of the heart, such as the right ven-­
tricular outflow tract, or infected sites at distal structures, such as stents
or other prosthetic material within branch pulmonary arteries. Hence,
a negative study does not exclude the diagnosis of IE. In patients with
prosthetic material advanced imaging such as [18F]FDG-PET/CT and
PET/CTA, can increase the diagnostic accuracy. [223]

In addition to the usual Endocarditis Team (see *Section 4* ), multidis-­
ciplinary care of CHD patients with IE from diagnosis to treatment
should be provided in specialized CHD centres with expertise in
CHD cardiac imaging, CHD surgery, infectious disease, and intensive
care. Surgical indications do not differ from those of acquired heart dis-­
ease IE. Mortality rates in CHD vary from 6% to 15%. [757][,][761][–][764] This
better prognosis compared with acquired heart disease IE may reflect
the higher proportion of right-heart IE, younger overall patient age, or
the comprehensive care in CHD centres.

Primary prevention of IE in CHD patients and corresponding patient
education is essential (see *Section 3* ). [765]

**4008** ESC Guidelines


**12.8. Infective endocarditis in rheumatic**

**heart disease**
Infective endocarditis is a known complication of RHD, [766] and acute
rheumatic fever (the antecedent of RHD) may even present with con-­
comitant IE. [767] Of the 3343 participants enrolled in The Global
Rheumatic Heart Disease Registry (REMEDY), [768] 133 (2.4%) had a his-­
tory of IE at enrolment, [769] and 20 (0.7%; 3.65 per 1000 patient-years)
developed IE during the 27-month follow-up. [770] These participants
were young with a median age of 28 years (interquartile range 18–40
years), 66.2% were women, and over 30% were children. The majority
of the over 40 million patients with RHD [771] live in low- and
middle-income countries and face socioeconomic and health-system
barriers [772] to adequate prevention, early diagnosis, and advanced
care and, therefore, are at particular risk of IE. [773]

Global access to surgery for RHD and RHD-associated complications
is extremely limited. [774] RHD patients presenting with fever, changing or
new murmurs should be investigated for IE. In studies from RHDendemic regions, RHD is the most common underlying cardiac condition,
with significant mortality and morbidity. [775][–][784] In those affected with oral
bacteria-related IE linked to RHD, oral *Streptococcus* spp. was the main
cause of IE associated with poor oral health status. [785] In RHD-endemic
countries, IE in children is strongly linked to RHD, [786][–][788] and when caus-­
ing HF, carries the highest case fatality rate. [789] IE is associated with en-­
hanced risk of death among patients with RHD undergoing isolated
mitral valve replacement (odds ratio 5.22, 95% confidence interval

[CI], 1368–19 915; *P* = 0.008). [790] Pregnancy is a particularly high-risk
period for women with RHD, with an increased risk of developing
IE. [791][,][792] However, high-income countries or countries with emerging
economies are seeing less IE linked to RHD, as the incidence rates of
RHD in these regions decrease. [793][–][796]

**12.9. Infective endocarditis during**

**pregnancy**
Infective endocarditis in pregnancy is a rare but extremely serious con-­
dition with high maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality, and is es-­
timated to complicate ∼1 in 100 000 pregnancies. [797][–][799] Maternal
mortality approaches 18%, with most deaths relating to HF or an em-­
bolic event, while pre-term birth is reported at 55.7% and foetal mor-­
tality at 29%. [800] Recurrent infective complications can occur in up to
27% of women post-partum. [801]

The diagnosis must be considered in pregnant women with unex-­
plained fever and cardiac signs (especially tachycardia), new or changing
cardiac murmurs, and peripheral signs of septic emboli. [802] Women with
CHD, RHD, [803] and structural heart disease, together with those with
prosthetic heart valves and with PWID are at particular risk. [800][,][804][–][807]

The gravity of the condition requires the inclusion of gynaecologists, obste-­
tricians, and neonatologists in the Endocarditis Team in any suspected cases,
and a diagnosis and treatment plan should be formulated without delay, as
this is key to saving the lives of mothers and infants. [799][,][808][,][809] Management
can be challenging, especially when the pregnant patient warrants a cardiac
operation under CPB. Although this poses a considerable risk to the foetus,
urgent surgery when indicated should not be delayed. [799][,][810]

**12.10. Infective endocarditis in**

**immunocompromised patients**
**12.10.1. Solid organ transplant recipients**

The incidence of IE in recipients of solid organ transplantation (SOT)
ranges between 1% and 2%. [107] SOT recipients with IE are younger


and have higher prevalence of co-morbidities (particularly renal and
liver disease) compared with non-SOT patients with IE. Among the
SOT patients with IE, the most common transplanted organ is the
kidney (72%), followed by liver (17%), and pancreas (8%). [811] Similar
to non-SOT patients, aortic followed by mitral IE are the most common
forms of IE while right-sided IE is uncommon. Interestingly, SOT pa-­
tients with IE more frequently have atrial or ventricular vegetations
without valve involvement (mural IE). [107] In-hospital and
healthcare-related IE are the most frequent causes of IE in recipients
of SOT and the most frequent microorganism involved is *S. aureus*
(34%), followed by *Enterococcus* spp. (17%), and *Streptococcus* spp.
(11%). [107][,][811]

Surgical valve repair/replacement is less frequently performed in SOT
patients with IE as compared with non-SOT patients. Interestingly, the
outcomes of IE in patients with SOT do not differ from those of
non-SOT with IE. [107][,][811] The reasons for the similar outcomes may
rely on the younger age of the SOT patients, the frequent contact
with the healthcare system which may lead to early diagnosis and treat-­
ment of IE, and the frequent involvement of infectious disease specialists
in the care of hospitalized SOT patients. However, compared with SOT
patients without IE, those who develop IE during the index transplant
hospitalization have worse outcomes. [811] The high levels of immunosup-­
pression probably negatively impact the IE course in these patients.

Heart transplant recipients represent 10% of SOT with IE pa-­
tients. [811] Among 57 heart transplant recipients who developed IE,
the most frequent organism was *S. aureus* (26%), followed by *A. fumiga-­*
*tus* (19%), and *E. faecalis* (12%). [105] The median time to IE presentation
after heart transplant was 8 years and the mitral valve was the most fre-­
quently affected, followed by mural and tricuspid valve IE. All-cause
mortality in this group of patients is high (45%), and fungal aetiology
is associated with worse outcomes. Similar to other SOT recipients,
heart transplant recipients were not frequently referred to surgery
(35%). [105]

**12.10.2. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus**

The advent of combined antiretroviral treatment has led to a reduction

in the risk of developing acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
but people living with HIV remain a vulnerable population for IE. [812] The
incidence of IE in people living with HIV has decreased over the last two
decades. A retrospective study from Spain has shown a reduction in the
incidence of IE from 18.2 per 100 000 patient-years between 1997 and
1999 to 2.9 events per 100 000 patient-years between 2000 and
2014. [813] Similarly, a registry from the United States of America
reported a reduction in the incidence of IE from 148 in 2007 to 112
in 2017. [141] Patients living with HIV and presenting with IE are becoming
older, and have a higher percentage of substance abuse and comorbidities. [141][,][813] Of importance, the number of patients living with
HIV who are admitted with IE have higher frequency of CHD, prior
valve surgery, CIED infection, and haemodialysis. [141][,][813] The most fre-­
quent microorganisms causing IE are *Staphylococcus* spp. (the majority
of which is *S. aureus* ), followed by *Streptococcus* spp., Gram-negative
bacilli, and enterococci. It is important to note that over the last two
decades, the frequency of CoNS as a cause of IE has decreased whereas
the frequency of streptococci, Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and
fungus has increased. [813] Community-acquired IE has become the
most frequent form while healthcare-associated IE rates have signifi-­
cantly decreased over time.

The outcomes of IE in people living with HIV have improved over the
years (from 23.9 to 5.5 deaths per 100 000 patient-years) and surgical

ESC Guidelines **4009**


treatment should follow the same indications as in patients without
HIV. [813]

**12.10.3. Patients with neutropaenia**
Neutropaenia is common in patients with haematological malignan-­
cies and in patients receiving chemotherapy for other malignancies,
but is rare in patients presenting with IE. [814] Neutrophils play an im-­
portant role in the pathogenesis of IE by producing layers of extracel-­
lular traps that entrap bacteria-platelet aggregates, leading to
expansion of these aggregates, vegetation growth, and the destruction
of tissues. [814] The diagnosis of IE can therefore be challenging in pa-­
tients with neutropaenia, delaying the appropriate treatment, and
worsening outcomes. Series reporting the clinical characteristics
and outcomes of IE in patients with neutropaenia are anecdotal. [814]

As in any other immunocompromised patient with IE, antibiotic and
surgical treatment are the same as in patients without neutropaenia.
It is important to take into consideration the side effects of some anti-­
biotics which may worsen the neutropaenia, such as cloxacillin and
ceftaroline. [815][,][816]

**12.11. Antithrombotic and anticoagulant**
**therapy in infective endocarditis**
Infective endocarditis by itself is not an indication for antithrombotics
or anticoagulants, and bleeding complications or stroke may in contrast
justify discontinuation or interruption of such therapies. Indications for
antithrombotic therapy or anticoagulants (e.g. atrial fibrillation, valve
prostheses, ischaemic heart disease, prior stroke, etc.) are prevalent
in the general population and, as a result, the clinician is often faced
with the challenge of these therapies in patients presenting with IE, es-­
pecially in cases where surgery is part of the treatment course. For pa-­
tients with IE and stroke, thrombolytic therapy is not recommended
(see *Section 9.1* ). However, thrombectomy may be considered in se-­
lected cases with large vessel occlusion.

The level of evidence underlying the recommendations for
antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy in IE is low and should
be discussed within the Endocarditis Team. Bridging with lowmolecular-weight heparin/unfractionated heparin instead of oral antic-­
oagulants should be considered early on in the IE course, especially for
patients in whom surgery is indicated. To date, no data support initi-­
ation of either antithrombotics nor anticoagulants for treatment or
prevention of stroke in IE.

**12.12. Non-bacterial thrombotic**

**endocarditis**

Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is a rare condition with
an incidence varying from 1.1% to 1.6% in patient-series from autopsy
studies. [818][,][819] Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis occurs in patients
with a predisposing factor and/or a hypercoagulable state, such as sys-­
temic lupus erythematous (SLE), APLs (Libman–Sacks endocarditis),
cancer (marantic endocarditis), disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC), or various other chronic diseases (tuberculosis or autoimmune
disease). [820][,][821] Increased production of coagulation factors, of cyto-­
kines, and high tissue factor expression are potential mechanisms
underlying NBTE in cancer patients. [822]

In a recent contemporary registry, 41% of NBTE patients had cancer,
33% SLE, and 36% APLs, with 21% of patients having both SLE and
APLs. [823] Among the patients with malignancies, the three most fre-­
quent cancers were lung adenocarcinoma, breast, and pancreatic can-­
cer. Stroke was the most frequent clinical presentation at admission
(60%), while HF was observed in 21% and acute coronary syndrome
in 7% of patients. Transthoracic echocardiography was able to confirm
the diagnosis in 45% of patients. The mitral valve was more often af-­
fected (62%) than the aortic valve (24%). [823]

The diagnosis of NBTE remains challenging and should be suspected
in patients presenting with systemic embolization and a predisposing
factor (i.e. cancer, APLs, SLE). Laboratory findings of a hypercoagulable
state (eg. lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and
anti-β 2 -glycoprotein 1 antibodies or DIC) may be present, but are nonspecific and may also be demonstrated in other IE patients with embolic
events. [162]

Echocardiography diagnosis should attempt to differentiate
non-bacterial thrombotic vegetation from IE, Lambl excrescences, or
fibroelastoma, or other benign intracardiac masses/tumours. [824]

Libman–Sacks vegetations may present with various shapes (sessile,
tubular, or coalescent), various levels of echogenicity (heterogeneously
or homogeneously), could be nodular or protuberant, are generally lo-­
cated near the leaflet’s edge of coaptation, and frequently have exten-­
sions to the mid and basal portions of the leaflet. They are rarely
associated with valve dysfunction and never with valve perforation,
which is an important method of differentiating from bacterial IE. [824]

Compared with TOE, TTE has a lower sensitivity (63%), specificity
(58%), negative predictive value (40%), and a moderate positive predict-­
ive value (78%) for the detection of NBTE. [823][,][824] Compared with
two-dimensional TOE, three-dimensional TOE provides additional in-­
formation and allows a better characterization of the vegetation. [823]

The treatment of the underlying cause (i.e. SLE or cancer) is crucial to
prevent recurrent NBTE. Anticoagulant treatment should be consid-­
ered in all patients and should be balanced against the individual

patient’s bleeding risk. [821] Patients may be anticoagulated with
low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, or unfractionated
heparin. There are no data to support the use of direct oral
anticoagulants in NBTE. In a randomized open-label multicentre study
comparing rivaroxaban and warfarin in patients with thrombotic APLs,

the use of rivaroxaban was associated with an increased rate of
thrombo-embolic events and major bleeding. [825] The role of surgery
is controversial and remains to be clarified. However, surgery should
be considered in patients with severe valve dysfunction or with large
vegetations. [823]

**12.13. Infective endocarditis and**

**malignancy**
There are limited data on the prevalence, clinical presentation, manage-­
ment, and outcome of IE in patients with malignancy. In a retrospective
Japanese cohort study including 170 patients, 17.6% had active malig-­
nancy. [826] Compared with patients without malignancy, patients with
malignancies were older, nosocomial IE was more frequent, and proce-­
dures before IE (non-dental, i.v. catheter insertion, invasive endoscopic,
or genitourinary procedures) were more frequent. [826] Another recent
study from the EURO-ENDO registry of 3085 patients with IE found a
history of malignancy in 11.6% of patients. [827] Patients with a history of
malignancy had a similar rate of theoretical indications for surgery, but
surgery was performed less often in this group. Mortality was higher in
the malignancy group with independent predictors for mortality being
elevated creatinine >2 mg/dL, congestive HF, and unperformed cardiac
surgery when indicated. [827] In IE patients with concomitant cancer, indi-­
cations for valve surgery should be discussed within the Endocarditis
Team, including a cardio-oncologist and the oncologist in charge of
the patient, in order to take into account the risks and benefits of sur-­
gery and cancer prognosis.
#### **13. Patient-centred care and ** **shared decision-making in infective ** **endocarditis**

**13.1. What is patient-centred care and**
**shared decision-making and why is it**
**important?**
Patient-centred care encourages involvement and collaboration be-­
tween patients, families, and healthcare providers during all stages of
diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. [828][–][831] Core elements of patientcentred care include: involvement of family and caregivers, respect
for patients’ preferences and values, care co-ordination and continuity,
information and education, as well as physical comfort and emotional
support ( *Figure 14* ). [828][–][830]

Shared decision-making involves a bidirectional process where pa-­
tients, family, and healthcare providers share information and discuss
care options in the context of the patients’ preferences, beliefs and va-­
lues, and the best available evidence ensuring that the patient under-­
stands the risks, [832][,][833] benefits, and possible consequences of the
different options. [834][–][836] The majority of patients prefer sharing deci-­
sions about their own health, if they are sufficiently informed and pre-­
pared. [837][,][838] Patient-centred care and shared decision-making have
been shown to contribute to improved concordance between care
providers and patients on treatment plans, as well as increased patient
satisfaction, quality of life, and health outcomes. [830][,][839][–][843]


**13.2. Patient-centred care and shared**
**decision-making in infective endocarditis**
The severity of IE, the complex and comprehensive diagnostics and
treatment, as well as the long illness trajectory, put special emphasis
on patient-centred care and shared decision-making in IE ( *Figure 14* ).
Quality of life appears to be impaired in IE survivors, with a significant
number of patients developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, or
even post-traumatic stress disorder following IE treatment. [604][,][844]

The time of diagnosis is often emotionally distressing to the patient
and family, as they face a life-threatening condition and lengthy
treatment. [845]

During the diagnostic and active treatment phase, healthcare provi-­
ders should make every effort to minimize patient discomfort (e.g. re-­
lated to symptoms and diagnostic procedures), and alleviate distress in
both patient and family by providing support and comprehensive and
timely information about the patient’s condition, therapeutic options,
and prognosis. Independent of the therapeutic strategy (i.e. surgical
vs. conservative), patient-centred care is key to ensure a good physical
and mental outcome during a lengthy treatment and hospitalization as-­
sociated with IE. Maintaining continuity of care, when possible, by min-­
imizing the number of providers the patient encounters and minimizing
transfers between and within units, is all part of a patient-centred care
approach. Allowing family visits at any time and providing the opportun-­
ity to uphold personal integrity and autonomy are important issues for
patients. National patient organizations and associations may be an op-­
tion for offering information and support to patients and their families.

The role of outpatient antimicrobial treatment options in IE should
be discussed using a shared decision-making approach, involving the pa-­
tient’s partner or family if possible. The outpatient treatment should be
in concordance with the patient’s and family’s preferences, also consid-­
ering transportation and self-care abilities. To monitor possible compli-­
cations, it is important to inform and educate patients and caregivers
about the signs and symptoms of disease progression or recurrence.

The early period after discharge can be challenging for patients and their
families, and patients report slow physical and mental recovery after IE, of-­
ten extending longer than anticipated. [603][,][604][,][846][,][847] Patient-centred care
should therefore extend further than the clinical treatment at the hospital
to ensure a good outcome after discharge. Though little research has ex-­
plored patients’ and families’ needs for recovery and rehabilitation follow-­
ing IE, patients with heart disease report experiencing new and continuous
challenges and a lack of knowledge and understanding after discharge,
which should be addressed to optimize recovery. [848]

It is recommended that a recovery plan is developed in collaboration
with the patient and their caregivers and that the plan is reviewed and
potentially adjusted following a short period after discharge. [849]

Physical exercise should be recommended based on an individual as-­
sessment of functional capacity (guided by physicians and physiothera-­
pists), and patient education and psychosocial support should address
the main problems and concerns patients and families have.
Importantly, patient education should also include information about
the risk of recurrence and preventive measures described in *Sections 3*
and *11* . Special consideration should be taken for patients with no close
relatives. Self-support groups or mentors may be introduced to patients
without support networks. Also, follow-up by telephone from the ward
staff, until full recovery has been reached, may be an option.

A palliative approach aims to improve the quality of life of patients
and their families who are facing problems associated with lifethreatening illness, which is relevant for many patients with IE. This ap-­
proach includes a holistic, needs-based perspective with the aims of

assessing and improving symptom management, communication,
advanced care planning, as well as psychosocial and spiritual needs. [850]
#### **14. Sex differences**

Female sex is less common in patients diagnosed with IE, being present
in approximately one-third of cases; a finding that has been demon-­
strated in multiple IE patient subpopulations and across different re-­
gions. [5][,][59][,][723][,][851][,][852] The reason why female sex is observed less
frequently in IE is unknown and deserves further investigation.
Possible reasons include underdiagnosis of IE in women, referral bias
in published studies, intrinsic protective mechanisms against IE in
women, and decreased incidence of risk factors for IE in women (e.g.


bicuspid aortic valve disease, previous heart valve replacement surgery),
among others. A recent nationwide population study of individual
patient-level linkage data of 7513 patients hospitalized for IE in
Scotland, however, demonstrated roughly equal proportions of male
and female patients throughout the 25-year study period. [27]

Female patients with IE have been demonstrated to have a higher preva-­
lence of several risk factors for IE in comparison to their male counterparts
including older age, mitral valve involvement, *S. aureus* infection, neuro-­
logical symptoms, and haemodialysis. [853][–][856] However, men have a higher
prevalence of other important risk factors including previous prosthetic
valve replacement, periannular complications, CAD, and liver cirrhosis. [855]

Some studies have demonstrated higher mortality rates for female
patients with IE, [856] while others have demonstrated no differences in

**4012** ESC Guidelines


early and 1-year mortality rates between males and females. [853][,][855][,][857]

The abovementioned population study from Scotland showed lower
mortality rates for women during the study period. [27]

Although surgery has been demonstrated to be protective against
mortality in several clinical scenarios (see *Section 8* ), surgery is per-­
formed less frequently in female patients with IE. [855][,][856] In a study using
the National Inpatient Sample of 81 942 patients hospitalized for IE
over an 11-year period, women were 43% less likely to undergo valve
replacement surgery, a significant difference that remained after adjust-­
ing for confounding factors. [855] The reason for decreased surgery in fe-­
male IE patients is unknown and requires further investigation.

Female sex has also been identified as an independent risk factor for
mortality in prediction models for patients with IE undergoing sur-­
gery. [416] However, a single-centre study suggested that worse observed
surgical outcomes in female patients with IE was related to their in-­
creased risk factors and severity of presentation, rather than gender
per se. [854] In addition, a large multicentre registry of 4300 patients
undergoing surgery for IE failed to identify female gender as an inde-­
pendent predictor of mortality. [852]
#### **15. Key messages**

**Prevention:**

- Populations at high risk of IE include patients with previous IE, pa-­

tients with surgical or transcatheter prosthetic valves or post-cardiac
valve repair, and patients with untreated CHD and surgically cor-­
rected CHD.

- Prevention of IE comprise hygienic measures (including oral hygiene)
for all individuals and antibiotic prophylaxis for patients at high risk of
IE undergoing oro-dental procedures.

**The Endocarditis Team:**

- The diagnosis and management of patients with IE should be dis-­

cussed with the Endocarditis Team, which includes healthcare pro-­
fessionals with the expertise to diagnose and treat IE and its
complications.

- Uncomplicated IE can be managed in a Referring Centre that remains
in early and regular communication with the Endocarditis Team of

the Heart Valve Centre.

- Patients with complicated IE should be treated in the Heart Valve
Centre, which must offer a wide range of ancillary specialty support
including onsite cardiac surgery expertise.

**Diagnosis:**

- The diagnosis of IE is based on major criteria, which include positive
blood cultures and valvular and perivalvular/periprosthetic anatomic
and metabolic lesions detected on imaging, and on minor criteria
which have been updated to include frequent embolic vascular dis-­
semination including asymptomatic lesions detected by imaging only.

- Clear diagnostic algorithms have been established to diagnose NVE,
PVE, and right-sided IE.

**Antimicrobial therapy – principles and methods:**

- Successful treatment of IE relies on microbial eradication by anti-­

microbial drugs. Surgery contributes by removing infected material
and draining abscesses.



- Antibiotic treatment of PVE should last longer (≥6 weeks) than that
of NVE (2–6 weeks).

- In both NVE and PVE, the duration of treatment is based on the first
day of effective antibiotic therapy (negative blood culture in the case
of initial positive blood culture), not on the day of surgery.

- The initial choice of empirical treatment depends on the use of pre-­

vious antibiotic therapy, whether IE is NVE or PVE (and if so, when
surgery was performed [early vs. late PVE]), the place where the in-­
fection took place (community, nosocomial, or non-nosocomial
healthcare-associated IE), and knowledge of the local epidemiology.

- The antibiotic treatment of IE has two phases. The first phase con-­

sists of 2 weeks of in-hospital i.v. treatment. In this initial phase, car-­
diac surgery should be performed if indicated, infected foreign bodies
should be removed, and cardiac as well as extracardiac abscesses
should be drained. In the second phase, in selected patients, the anti-­
biotic treatment can be completed within an outpatient parenteral or
oral antibiotic programme for up to 6 weeks.

- Aminoglycosides are not recommended in staphylococcal NVE be-­

cause their clinical benefits have not been demonstrated. In IE caused
by other microorganisms in which aminoglycosides are indicated,
they should be prescribed in a single daily dose to reduce
nephrotoxicity.

- Rifampin should be used only in IE involving foreign material, such as
PVE, after 3–5 days of effective antibiotic therapy.

- When daptomycin is indicated, it must be given at high doses (10 mg/
kg once daily) and combined with a second antibiotic (beta-lactams or
fosfomycin in beta-lactam allergic patients) to increase activity and
avoid the development of resistance.

- OPAT can only start when a TOE shows absence of local progression
and complications (e.g. severe valvular dysfunction).

- In the OPAT programme, patients continue with the same antibiotics
administered in the acute phase, if possible.

**Indications for surgery and management of main infective**
**endocarditis complications:**

- There are three main reasons to undergo surgery in the setting of
acute IE: HF, uncontrolled infection, and prevention of septic

embolization.

- While surgery during the acute phase of IE is usually performed on an
urgent basis (i.e. the patient undergoes surgery within 3–5 days),
some cases require emergency surgery (i.e. within 24 h), irrespective
of the pre-operative duration of antibiotic treatment.

**Other complications of infective endocarditis:**

- Stroke may be the first presenting symptom in patients with IE.
Unexplained fever accompanying a stroke in a patient with risk fac-­
tors for IE should trigger the suspicion of IE.

- Epicardial pacemaker implantation should be considered in patients
undergoing surgery for IE with complete AVB and other risk factors.

- MRI or PET/CT are indicated in patients with suspected spondylodis-­

citis and vertebral osteomyelitis complicating IE.

**Surgical therapy principles and methods:**

- The indication to perform invasive coronary angiography or CTA
prior to surgery for IE should be based on the presence of cardiovas-­
cular risk factors in patients with aortic valve IE.

- Surgery should not be delayed in patients with non-haemorrhagic
stroke and clear indications for surgery. In patients with significant

ESC Guidelines **4013**


pre-operative haemorrhagic stroke, a delay in operative management
(≥4 weeks) is generally recommended.

- The decision of not offering surgery when indicated should be made
in the setting of an Endocarditis Team.

**Outcome after discharge – follow-up and long-term**
**prognosis:**

- Relapse is a repeat episode of IE caused by the same microorganism
and represents a failure of treatment, and mandates a search for a
persistent focus of infection and an evaluation towards surgical
therapy.

- Reinfection is an infection caused by a different microorganism, usu-­

ally more than 6 months after the initial episode.

- Once antibiotic treatment has been completed, blood cultures
should be performed.

- Patients discharged after the first episode of IE should remain under
close surveillance for potential long-term complications.

**Management of specific situations:**

- Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent CIED-related IE before dental and

other non-cardiac interventions is not warranted.

- A single positive blood culture with no other clinical evidence of in-­

fection should not result in removal of the CIED. Complete CIED re-­
moval is recommended for all patients with confirmed infection of
the lead(s).

- The indication for CIED reimplantation should always be reevaluated and no part of the removed system should be reimplanted.
In pacemaker-dependent patients, an active-fixation lead may be in-­
troduced and connected to an external pacemaker for up to 6 weeks.

- Surgical treatment of right-sided IE is indicated in patients with per-­

sistent bacteraemia, right ventricular dysfunction, recurrent septic
pulmonary embolism and respiratory compromise, and involvement

of left-sided structures.

- Multidisciplinary care of CHD patients with IE, from diagnosis to
treatment, should be provided in specialized CHD centres with ex-­
pertise in CHD cardiac imaging, CHD surgery, and intensive care.

**Patient-centred care and shared decision-making in**

**infective endocarditis:**

- In patients with IE, shared decision-making enables the integration of
patients’ preferences, values, and priorities to achieve a good treat-­
ment decision.

- In patients with IE and without support networks or severely
impacted by social determinants, a recovery plan developed in
collaboration with the patient should be established, highlighting
the information about the risk of recurrence and preventive

measures.

**Sex differences:**

- Female sex is less common in patients diagnosed with IE, being pre-­

sent in approximately one-third of cases.
#### **16. Gaps in evidence**

- The majority of the recommendations with a level of evidence B are
based on observational studies rather than single RCTs or
meta-analyses from RCTs.


**Prevention:**

- In the intermediate or unknown risk condition groups, there is no evi-­

dence to recommend antibiotic prophylaxis.

- There is currently no evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophy-­

laxis after the implantation of a left atrial appendage occlusion device.

**Diagnosis:**

- More data on the accuracy of diagnosis of culture-negative IE using
molecular biology techniques, or the determination of bacterial/fun-­
gal cell-free DNA in blood samples, is required.

- Standardization of the methodology to assess the size of the vegeta-­

tions has not been established.

- More data on the diagnostic performance of intracardiac echocardi-­

ography in PVE are needed.

- The role of [18F]FDG-PET/CT(A) in NVE needs to be established.

- Routine use of imaging tests to screen the presence of embolic
events, especially brain imaging, is not well established.

- In fungal endocarditis, the role of molecular and biochemical indica-­

tors to establish the diagnosis is not well studied.

**Antimicrobial therapy – principles and methods:**

- Clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of recom-­

mended antimicrobial treatment regimens and new combinations
or antimicrobials. Many recommendations come from clinical trials

for bacteraemia and not for IE.

- Effective antibiotic treatment in patients with highly penicillinresistant oral streptococci should be investigated.

- Randomized data to establish the best medical strategy in staphylo-­

coccal IE are required.

- Effective antibiotic treatments for patients with HLAR *E. faecalis* IE
and hypersensitivity to beta-lactams need further research.

- Effective treatments for vancomycin-resistant enterococcal IE need

further research.

- Randomized head-to-head comparisons of different antibiotics to better
judge efficacy and toxicity (e.g. for aminoglycosides) are needed.

- The duration of antibiotic treatment has been established empirically
and no randomized data have been published.

- The efficacy of combined antifungal therapy has not been studied.

- The empirical use of an aminoglycoside-sparing empirical combin-­

ation regimen has not been extensively studied.

- More data on implementation of oral treatment in large studies are

needed.

**Indications for surgery and management of main infective**
**endocarditis complications:**

- The indication of surgical treatment in patients with IE rely mainly on
expert opinion based on observational studies.

- RCTs are required to establish the indication and timing of surgery in
patients with:

   - Increased surgical risk.

  - Large vegetations but without other indications for surgery.

  - Cerebral emboli or bleeding.

   - Patients with uncontrolled infection.

- More data on the need and timing of coronary angiogram before
endocarditis surgery.

- There is a lack of information on timing and sequence of interven-­

tions in patients with multiple septic sources.

- More data are needed on the efficacy and safety of vegetation extrac-­

tion systems in right-sided IE.

**4014** ESC Guidelines


**Other complications of infective endocarditis:**

- There is limited information on the safety and efficacy of mechanical
thrombectomy in IE-related embolic strokes.

- There are no prospective data on the timing and safety of splenec-­

tomy for splenic abscess, complicating IE in relation to surgical valve

treatment.

**Surgical therapy principles and methods:**

- There is a significant need for scores to predict futility of surgical
management in very high-risk patients.

- There is a lack of data on the most appropriate anticoagulation regi-­

men in patients with PVE complicated by haemorrhagic stroke.

**Outcome after discharge: follow-up and long-term**
**prognosis:**

- Clinical trials are required to assess the efficacy of rehabilitation,
including optimal timing, duration, methods, and components.

- Data on patient-reported outcomes during short- and long-term
follow-up are needed.

**Management of specific situations:**

- Additional data on the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of IE
in patients treated with transcatheter valve therapies or left atrial ap-­
pendage occluders are needed.



- There is an unmet clinical question on the efficacy and safety of sur-­

gical treatment of IE in patients previously treated with transcatheter
valve therapies.

- Randomized data on the timing of CIED reimplantation after device

removal after CIED infection are needed.

- There is a lack of evidence on whether or not CIED removal should

be routinely performed in patients with left-sided IE.

- Randomized data on surgery in right-sided IE are required.

**Patient-centred care and shared decision-making in**

**infective endocarditis:**

- As no disease-specific evidence exists, data on patient-centred care
and shared decision-making in IE is needed.

- Data on how patient-centred care and shared decision-making in pa-­

tients with social and mental health vulnerabilities can improve their
outcomes are lacking.

- Data on the effect of patient-centred care and shared decisionmaking interventions are required to implement effective strategies.

**Sex differences:**

- Further data are required to determine why IE is less frequently ob-­

served, and why the outcomes are worse, in female patients.

- The reasons for lower referral to surgery in female patients with IE as
compared with male patients need to be determined and addressed.
