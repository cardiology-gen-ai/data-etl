### Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate all available evidence on a particular issue at the time of the writing process, with the aim of assisting health professionals in selecting the best management strategies
for an individual patient with a given condition, taking into account
the impact on outcome, as well as the risk–benefit ratio of particular diagnostic or therapeutic means. Guidelines and recommendations should help health professionals to make decisions in their
daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning an individual
patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in
consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of Guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) as well as by other societies and organisations. Because of the impact on clinical practice,
quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be
[found on the ESC Web Site (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[Writing-ESC-Guidelines). ESC Guidelines represent the official pos-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
ition of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.
Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to
represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients
with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a
comprehensive review of the published evidence for management
(including diagnosis, treatment, prevention and rehabilitation) of
a given condition according to ESC Committee for Practice
Guidelines (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of
the risk–benefit ratio. Estimates of expected health outcomes for
larger populations were included, where data exist. The level of
evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular
management options were weighed and graded according to predefined scales, as outlined in Tables 1 and 2.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declarations of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. These forms were
[compiled into one file and can be found on the ESC website (http://](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[www.escardio.org/guidelines). Any changes in declarations of inter-](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
est that arise during the writing period must be notified to the ESC
and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support
from the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare
industry.
The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
Guidelines produced by task forces, expert groups or consensus panels. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive

review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions the Guidelines are approved by all the experts involved
in the Task Force. The finalized document is approved by
the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The Guidelines were developed after careful consideration of the scientific
and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of
their dating.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines covers not only the
integration of the most recent research, but also the creation of
educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations. To implement all guidelines, condensed pocket guidelines versions, summary slides, booklets with essential messages,
summary cards for non-specialists, and an electronic version for
digital applications (smartphones, etc.) are produced. These versions are abridged and thus, if needed, one should always refer to
the full text version, which is freely available on the ESC website.
The National Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse,
translate and implement the ESC Guidelines. Implementation


programmes are needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Surveys and registries are needed to verify that real-life daily practice is in keeping with what is recommended in the guidelines, thus
completing the loop between clinical research, writing of guidelines,
disseminating them and implementing them into clinical practice.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as
in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines
do not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility
of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions
in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient and the patient’s caregiver where appropriate
and/or necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to
verify the rules and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the
time of prescription.
### 1. Introduction

The pericardium (from the Greek p1ri´, ‘around’ and ka´rdion,
‘heart’) is a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots
of the great vessels. The pericardial sac has two layers, a serous visceral layer (also known as epicardium when it comes into contact
with the myocardium) and a fibrous parietal layer. It encloses the
pericardial cavity, which contains pericardial fluid. The pericardium
fixes the heart to the mediastinum, gives protection against infection
and provides lubrication for the heart.
Pericardial diseases may be either isolated disease or part of a systemic disease. [1] [–] [5] The main pericardial syndromes that are encountered in clinical practice include pericarditis (acute, subacute,

ESC Guidelines 2925


chronic and recurrent), pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade,
constrictive pericarditis and pericardial masses. [1][,][4][,][5] All medical therapies for pericardial diseases are off-label, since no drug has been registered until now for a specific pericardial indication.

1.1 What is new in pericardial diseases?

Pericardial diseases are relatively common in clinical practice and
new data have been published since the publication of the 2004
ESC Guidelines on pericardial diseases. [1]

New diagnostic strategies have been proposed for the triage of
patients with pericarditis and pericardial effusion and allow the selection of high-risk patients to be admitted as well as when and how
additional diagnostic investigations are to be performed. [4] [–] [9] Moreover, specific diagnostic criteria have been proposed for acute and
recurrent pericarditis in clinical practice. [2][,][4] [–] [15]

Multimodality imaging for pericardial diseases has become an essential approach for a modern and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. Both the American Society of Echocardiography and the
European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging have provided recommendation documents in recent years. [2][,][3]

The aetiology and pathophysiology of pericardial diseases remain
to be better characterized, but new data supporting the immunemediated pathogenesis of recurrences and new forms related to
autoinflammatory diseases have been documented, especially in
paediatric patients. [4][,][6] The first epidemiological data have become
available. [7][,][16]

Age and gender issues are now more evident and clear, including
specific recommendations for patients during pregnancy. [17] [–] [27]

Major advances have occurred in therapy with the first multicentre randomized clinical trials. [10][,][11][,][13][ –][ 15] Colchicine has been

demonstrated as a first-line drug to be added to conventional antiinflammatory therapies in patients with a first episode of pericarditis
or recurrences in order to improve the response to therapy, increase remission rates and reduce recurrences. [10][,][11][,][13][ –] [15] Specific
therapeutic dosing without a loading dose and weight-adjusted
doses have been proposed to improve patient compliance. [11][,][15]

New therapeutic choices have become available for refractory
recurrent pericarditis, including alternative immunosuppressive
therapies (e.g. azathioprine), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs)
and interleukin-1 (IL-1) antagonists (e.g. anakinra). [20][ –][ 23][,][28][ –][ 32]

Pericardiectomy has been demonstrated as a possible valuable
alternative to additional medical therapies in patients with refractory recurrent pericarditis. [33] The first large prospective and
retrospective studies (.100 patients) have investigated the prognosis and complication risk in patients with acute and recurrent
pericarditis. [7][,][9][,][34][ –][ 38]

Imaging techniques for the detection of pericardial inflammation

[e.g. cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)] may identify forms of initial
reversible constrictive pericarditis, allowing a trial of medical antiinflammatory therapy that may reduce the need for surgery. [2][,][39] [–] [41]

In conclusion, significant new data have become available since
2004, and a new version of guidelines has become mandatory for
clinical practice. Nevertheless, in the field of pericardial diseases

there are a limited number of randomized controlled trials

(RCTs). Therefore the number of class I level A indications are

limited.

### 2. Epidemiology, aetiology and classification of pericardial diseases

2.1 Epidemiology

Despite the relative high frequency of pericardial diseases, there are
few epidemiological data, especially from primary care. Pericarditis
is the most common disease of the pericardium encountered in clinical practice. The incidence of acute pericarditis has been reported
as 27.7 cases per 100,000 population per year in an Italian urban
area. [7] Pericarditis is responsible for 0.1% of all hospital admissions
and 5% of emergency room admissions for chest pain. [4][,][5][,][42] Data collected from a Finnish national registry (2000–9) showed a standardized incidence rate of hospitalizations for acute pericarditis of 3.32
per 100,000 person-years. [16] These data were limited to hospitalized
patients and therefore may account for only a minority of cases, as
many patients with pericarditis are commonly not admitted to hospital. [8][,][9][,][42][,][43] Men ages 16–65 years were at higher risk for pericarditis (relative risk 2.02) than women in the general admitted
population, with the highest risk difference among young adults
compared with the overall population. Acute pericarditis caused
0.20% of all cardiovascular admissions. The proportion of caused admissions declined by an estimated 51% per 10-year increase in age.
The in-hospital mortality rate for acute pericarditis was 1.1% and
was increased with age and severe co-infections (pneumonia or
septicaemia). [16] However, this is a study based on hospital admissions only. Recurrences affect about 30% of patients within
18 months after a first episode of acute pericarditis. [10][,][11]

2.2 Aetiology

A simple aetiological classification for pericardial diseases is to
consider infectious and non-infectious causes (Table 3). [4][,][6][,][12][,][44] The
aetiology is varied and depends on the epidemiological background,
patient population and clinical setting. In developed countries,
viruses are usually the most common aetiological agents of pericarditis, [6] whereas tuberculosis (TB) is the most frequent cause of
pericardial diseases in the world and developing countries, where
TB is endemic. In this setting, TB is often associated with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, especially in sub-Saharan
Africa. [44]
### 3. Pericardial syndromes

Pericardial syndromes include different clinical presentations of
pericardial diseases with distinctive signs and symptoms that can
be grouped in specific ‘syndromes’. The classical pericardial syndromes include pericarditis, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade
and constrictive pericarditis. Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade may occur without pericarditis and will be considered in
separate chapters. Specific considerations apply to cases with pericarditis and concomitant myocardial inflammatory involvement,
usually referred to in the literature as ‘myopericarditis’.

3.1 Acute pericarditis

Acute pericarditis is an inflammatory pericardial syndrome with or
without pericardial effusion. [1][ –][ 11][,][42] The clinical diagnosis can be

cases)—a superficial scratchy or squeaking sound best heard with
the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left sternal border;
(iii) electrocardiogram (ECG) changes (up to 60% of cases)—with
new widespread ST elevation or PR depression in the acute phase
(Web Figure 1); and (iv) pericardial effusion (up to 60% of cases, generally mild) (Web Figure 2). Additional signs and symptoms may be
present according to the underlying aetiology or systemic disease
(i.e. signs and symptoms of systemic infection such as fever and
leucocytosis, or systemic inflammatory disease or cancer). [45]

Widespread ST-segment elevation has been reported as a
typical hallmark sign of acute pericarditis (Web Figure 1). However,
changes in the ECG imply inflammation of the epicardium,
since the parietal pericardium itself is electrically inert. [5][ –][ 7][,][34]

Typical ECG changes have been reported in up to 60% of
cases. [10][,][11] The temporal evolution of ECG changes with acute
pericarditis is highly variable from one patient to another and is
affected by therapy. Major differential diagnoses include acute
coronary syndromes with ST-segment elevation and early
repolarization. [6][,][12][,][46]

Elevation of markers of inflammation [i.e. C-reactive protein
(CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), as well as
elevation of the white blood cell count] is a common and supportive finding in patients with acute pericarditis and may be helpful
for monitoring the activity of the disease and efficacy of
therapy. [2][,][47] Patients with concomitant myocarditis may present
with an elevation of markers of myocardial injury [i.e. creatine kinase (CK), troponin]. [7][,][34]

ESC Guidelines 2927


A chest X-ray is generally normal in patients with acute
pericarditis since an increased cardiothoracic ratio only occurs
with pericardial effusions exceeding 300 ml. [48] In the case of pleuropulmonary diseases, signs of pleuropericardial involvement may be
found in patients with pericarditis. [2][,][3]


features can be managed as outpatients with empiric antiinflammatories and short-term follow-up after 1 week to assess

3.1.1 Clinical management and therapy
It is not mandatory to search for the aetiology in all patients, especially in countries with a low prevalence of TB, because of the relatively benign course associated with the common causes of
pericarditis and the relatively low yield of diagnostic investigations. [6][,][8][,][12][,][49] Specific final identifiable causes (non-viral–
non-idiopathic) as well as high-risk features in the context of acute
pericarditis have been identified as being associated with an increased risk of complications during follow-up (tamponade, recurrences and constriction). [9][,][12][,][43][,][50] The major risk factors associated
with poor prognosis after multivariate analysis include high fever

[.388C (.100.48F)], subacute course (symptoms over several
days without a clear-cut acute onset), evidence of large pericardial
effusion (i.e. diastolic echo-free space .20 mm), cardiac tamponade and failure to respond within 7 days to non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). [9][,][43][,][50] Other risk factors should also
be considered (i.e. ‘minor risk factors’); these are based on expert
opinion and literature review, including pericarditis associated
with myocarditis (myopericarditis), immunodepression, trauma
and oral anticoagulant therapy.
On this basis a triage for acute pericarditis is proposed (Figure 1,
Web Table 6). [5][,][6][,][43] Any clinical presentation that may suggest an
underlying aetiology (e.g. a systemic inflammatory disease) or
with at least one predictor of poor prognosis (major or minor
risk factors) warrants hospital admission and an aetiology
search. [9][,][43][,][49][ –][ 51] On the other hand, patients without these


In patients identified with a cause other than viral infection, specific therapy appropriate to the underlying disorder is indicated [49][,][51] and the epidemiological background (high vs. low
prevalence of TB) should be considered. [8][,][12][,][52] The first nonpharmacological recommendation is to restrict physical activity
beyond ordinary sedentary life until resolution of symptoms and
normalization of CRP for patients not involved in competitive
sports. [53] Athletes are recommended to return to competitive
sports only after symptoms have resolved and diagnostic tests
(i.e. CRP, ECG and echocardiogram) have been normalized. [53][,][54]

A minimal restriction of 3 months (after the initial onset of the attack) has been arbitrarily defined according to expert consensus. [54]

We suggest applying this restriction only to athletes, while a
shorter period (until remission) may be suitable for non-athletes.
Aspirin or NSAIDs are mainstays of therapy for acute pericarditis. [5][,][6][,][55][,][56] Different anti-inflammatory drugs have been proposed (Table 5).
The choice of drug should be based on the history of the patient
(contraindications, previous efficacy or side effects), the presence of
concomitant diseases (favouring aspirin over other NSAIDs when
aspirin is already needed as antiplatelet treatment) and physician
expertise. [56]

Colchicine is recommended at low, weight-adjusted doses to
improve the response to medical therapy and prevent recurrences. [10][,][11][,][57][ –][ 59] Tapering of colchicine is not mandatory but
may be considered to prevent persistence of symptoms and recurrence. [5][,][6][,][56] Corticosteroids should be considered as a second

option in patients with contraindications and failure of aspirin or
NSAIDs because of the risk of favouring the chronic evolution of
the disease and promoting drug dependence; in this case

equivalent). [35] The initial dose should be maintained until resolution of symptoms and normalization of CRP, then tapering
should be considered. [5][,][6][,][35][,][47][,][56]

3.1.2 Prognosis
Most patients with acute pericarditis (generally those with presumed viral or idiopathic pericarditis) have a good long-term prognosis. [36] Cardiac tamponade rarely occurs in patients with acute
idiopathic pericarditis, and is more common in patients with a specific underlying aetiology such as malignancy, TB or purulent pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis may occur in,1% of patients
with acute idiopathic pericarditis, and is also more common in patients with a specific aetiology. The risk of developing constriction
can be classified as low (,1%) for idiopathic and presumed viral
pericarditis; intermediate (2–5%) for autoimmune, immunemediated and neoplastic aetiologies; and high (20–30%) for bacterial aetiologies, especially with TB and purulent pericarditis. [36]

Approximately 15–30% of patients with idiopathic acute pericarditis who are not treated with colchicine will develop either recurrent
or incessant disease, while colchicine may halve the recurrence
rate. [10][,][11][,][13] [–] [15]


3.2 Incessant and chronic pericarditis

The term ‘incessant’ has been adopted for cases with persistent
symptoms without a clear-cut remission after the acute episode.
The term ‘chronic’ generally refers—especially for pericardial effusions—to disease processes lasting .3 months. [48] The Task Force
suggests that the term ‘acute’ should be adopted for new-onset
pericarditis, ‘incessant’ for pericarditis with symptoms persisting
for .4–6 weeks (that is generally the approximate length of conventional anti-inflammatory therapy and its tapering), [11][,][60] and
‘chronic’ for pericarditis lasting .3 months.

3.3 Recurrent pericarditis

Recurrent pericarditis is diagnosed with a documented first episode
of acute pericarditis, a symptom-free interval of 4–6 weeks or
longer and evidence of subsequent recurrence of pericarditis
(Table 4). [11][,][13][ –][ 15] Diagnosis of recurrence is established according
to the same criteria as those used for acute pericarditis. CRP, [2][,][47]

computed tomography (CT) and/or CMR may provide confirmatory findings to support the diagnosis in atypical or doubtful cases
showing pericardial inflammation through evidence of oedema
and contrast enhancement of the pericardium. [2][,][39]

The recurrence rate after an initial episode of pericarditis ranges
from 15 to 30%, [10][,][11] and may increase to 50% after a first recurrence
in patients not treated with colchicine, [13] [–][ 15] particularly if treated

with corticosteroids.

In developed countries, the aetiology is often not identified in
most immunocompetent patients, and it is generally presumed to
be immune-mediated. [60] [–] [62] A common cause of recurrence is inad
equate treatment of the first episode of pericarditis. In up to 20% of
cases, when additional virological studies have been conducted on
pericardial fluid and tissue, a viral aetiology is detected. [63]

3.3.1 Therapy
Recurrent pericarditis therapy should be targeted at the underlying
aetiology in patients with an identified cause. Aspirin or NSAIDs remain the mainstay of therapy (Table 6, Web Box, Web Table 1A). Colchicine is recommended on top of standard anti-inflammatory
therapy, without a loading dose and using weight-adjusted doses
(i.e. 0.5 mg once daily if body weight is,70 kg or 0.5 mg twice daily
if it is ≥70 kg, for ≥6 months) (Table 6, Web Table 1B) in order to
improve the response to medical therapy, improve remission rates
and prevent recurrences. [13] [–] [15][,][58][,][59]

In cases of incomplete response to aspirin/NSAIDs and colchicine, corticosteroids may be used, but they should be added at
low to moderate doses to aspirin/NSAIDs and colchicine as triple
therapy, not replace these drugs, in order to achieve better control
of symptoms. Corticosteroids at low to moderate doses (i.e. prednisone 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day) should be avoided if infections, particularly bacterial and TB, cannot be excluded and should be
restricted to patients with specific indications (i.e. systemic inflammatory diseases, post-pericardiotomy syndromes, pregnancy) or
NSAID contraindications (true allergy, recent peptic ulcer or
gastrointestinal bleeding, oral anticoagulant therapy when the
bleeding risk is considered high or unacceptable) or intolerance
or persistent disease despite appropriate doses. [58] Although corticosteroids provide rapid control of symptoms, they favour

chronicity, more recurrences and side effects. [35][,][55][,][61] If corticosteroids are used, their tapering should be particularly slow. A critical
threshold for recurrences is a 10–15 mg/day dose of prednisone
or equivalent. At this threshold, very slow decrements as small as
1.0–2.5 mg at intervals of 2–6 weeks are useful. In cases of recurrence, every effort should be made not to increase the dose or to
reinstate corticosteroids (Tables 6 and 7). [5][,][6][,][35][,][61]

After obtaining a complete response, tapering should be done
with a single class of drug at a time before colchicine is gradually discontinued (over several months in the most difficult cases). Recurrences are possible after discontinuation of each drug. Each tapering
should be attempted only if symptoms are absent and CRP is
normal. [5][,][6][,][47][,][56] The Task Force does not recommend influenza vaccine as a preventive measure for pericarditis in patients with recurrent pericarditis, since the influenza virus is not a usual cause of
pericarditis. The influenza vaccine should be administered according
to specific indications beyond pericarditis; moreover, recurrences
are generally immune mediated, and inappropriate or unwanted
stimulation of the immune system may trigger or worsen an episode
of pericarditis.
An alternative effective approach to minimize systemic side effects related to corticosteroids may be intrapericardial administration of non-absorbable corticosteroids, [64][,][65] but this technique
requires further investigation. For those patients who require unacceptably high long-term doses of corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone
15–25 mg/day) or who do not respond to anti-inflammatory therapies, several drugs have been used, including azathioprine, [28] IVIG
(immunomodulatory but also anti-viral) [29][,][30] and anakinra, a recombinant IL-1b receptor antagonist, [31][,][32] but strong evidence-based
data are lacking (Web Table 2). Other immunosuppressive drugs

[i.e. cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents] have been only
anecdotally reported. Less toxic agents might be preferred, and
eventually combined, with the therapy being tailored to the individual patient and physician experience (Figure 2). Azathioprine is mainly a slow-acting corticosteroid-sparing agent, useful to control the
disease for a long-term follow-up, while anakinra and IVIG are


|Starting dose 0.25–0.50 mg/kg/daya|Taperingb|
|---|---|
|>50 mg|10 mg/day every 1–2 weeks|
|50–25 mg|5–10 mg/day every 1–2 weeks|
|25–15 mg|2.5 mg/day every 2–4 weeks|
|<15 mg|1.25–2.5 mg/day every<br>2–6 weeks|


effective during the acute phase, though recurrences may occur
after discontinuation. [29][ –][ 32] Drugs such as IVIG, anakinra and
azathioprine may be considered in cases of proven infectionnegative, corticosteroid-dependent, recurrent pericarditis not responsive to colchicine after careful assessment of the costs, risks
and eventually consultation by multidisciplinary experts, including
immunologists and/or rheumatologists, in the absence of a specific
expertise. It is also mandatory to educate the patient and his/her
caregivers about the clinical risks related to immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive drugs and the safety measures to adopt during the
treatment. As a last resort, pericardiectomy may be considered, but
only after a thorough trial of unsuccessful medical therapy, and with
referral of the patient to a centre with specific expertise in this surgery. [33] The physical activity restrictions in acute pericarditis apply
also to recurrences. [53][,][54]

3.3.2 Prognosis
Severe complications are uncommon in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. [37][,][60][,][61] Cardiac tamponade is rare and generally occurs at
the beginning of the disease. Constrictive pericarditis has never
been reported in these patients, despite numerous recurrences,
and the overall risk is lower than that recorded after a first episode
of acute pericarditis (,1%). [36][,][37][,][61] Thus it is important to reassure
patients about their prognosis, explaining the nature of the disease
and its likely course. The complication rates are related to the aetiology and not to the number of recurrences. Drug treatment should

take into account this favourable outcome to avoid more toxic

agents. However, quality of life can be severely affected in patients
with repeated recurrences, subacute or incessant pericarditis and
glucocorticoid dependence.

3.4 Pericarditis associated with
myocardial involvement
(myopericarditis)

Pericarditis and myocarditis share common aetiologies, and overlapping forms may be encountered in clinical practice. [34][,][66] Pericarditis
with known or clinically suspected concomitant myocardial involvement should be referred to as ‘myopericarditis’, while predominant
myocarditis with pericardial involvement should be referred to as
‘perimyocarditis’, according to Task Force consensus. The classical
presentation is chest pain associated with other signs of pericarditis
(pericardial rubs, ST-segment elevation and pericardial effusion)
plus the elevation of markers of myocardial damage (i.e. troponins).
Limited clinical data on the causes of myopericarditis suggest that
viral infections are among the most common causes in developed

countries, while other infectious causes are more common in devel
oping countries (especially TB). Cardiotropic viruses can cause pericardial and myocardial inflammation via direct cytolytic or cytotoxic
effects and/or subsequent immune-mediated mechanisms. Such


mechanisms are especially involved in cases associated with connective tissue diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases and
radiation-induced, drug-induced or vaccinia-associated myopericardial involvement. Many cases of myopericarditis are subclinical. In
other patients, cardiac symptoms and signs are masked by pronounced systemic manifestations of infection or inflammation. [66] In
many cases, myopericarditis manifestations are preceded by or
are sometimes concomitant with an acute respiratory illness (especially acute tonsillitis, pneumonia) or gastroenteritis. The increased
sensitivity of troponin assays and contemporary widespread use
of troponins has greatly increased the reported number of
cases. [7][,][34][,][66] [–] [68]

3.4.1 Definition and diagnosis
The diagnosis of predominant pericarditis with myocardial involvement, or ‘myopericarditis’, can be clinically established if patients
with definite criteria for acute pericarditis show elevated biomarkers of myocardial injury (troponin I or T, CK-MB fraction) without
newly developed focal or diffuse impairment of left ventricular function in echocardiography or CMR. [34] The term myopericarditis indicates a primarily pericarditic syndrome with minor myocardial
involvement, which describes the majority of combined pericarditis
and myocarditis cases encountered in clinical practice. [7][,][9][,][34][,][68]

On the other hand, evidence of new-onset focal or diffuse reduc
tion of left ventricular function in patients with elevated myocardial
biomarkers and clinical criteria for acute pericarditis suggests predominant myocarditis with pericardial involvement (‘perimyocarditis’). [34][,][66] Definite confirmation of the presence of myocarditis will
require endomyocardial biopsy according to the Myocardial and
Pericardial Diseases Working Group position statement. [69] However, the benign prognosis of patients with suspected concomitant
myocardial involvement in predominant pericarditis (myopericarditis), with absent or mild left ventricular dysfunction, and no symptoms of heart failure does not clinically require endomyocardial
biopsy. [6][,][34][,][66] [–] [68][,][70][,][71]

In cases of pericarditis with suspected associated myocarditis,
coronary angiography (according to clinical presentation and risk
factor assessment) is recommended in order to rule out acute coronary syndromes. CMR is recommended for the confirmation of
myocardial involvement and to rule out ischaemic myocardial necrosis in the absence of significant coronary disease; this has clinical
and therapeutic implications. [34][,][66]

3.4.2 Management
Hospitalization is recommended for diagnosis and monitoring of
patients with myocardial involvement and differential diagnosis,
especially with acute coronary syndromes. In the setting of myopericarditis, management is similar to that recommended for pericarditis. Empirical anti-inflammatory therapies (i.e. aspirin 1500–3000
mg/day) or NSAIDs (ibuprofen 1200–2400 mg/day or indomethacin 75–150 mg/day) are usually prescribed to control chest pain,
while corticosteroids are prescribed as a second choice in cases
of contraindication, intolerance or failure of aspirin/NSAIDs. [66] In
the setting of myopericarditis, some authors recommend reducing
dosages, as compared with pure pericarditis, because in animal models of myocarditis, NSAIDs have been shown to be non-efficacious
and may enhance inflammation, increasing mortality. [69][,][70][,][72][,][73]

ESC Guidelines 2933


However, the application of these findings from animal models to
humans may be questionable. [66] In addition, there are insufficient

data to recommend the use of colchicine, which is a well-established
adjunctive treatment for acute and recurrent pericarditis. [58] Despite
the lack of specific therapies for most cases, several non-specific recommendations are important. Rest and avoidance of physical activity beyond normal sedentary activities is recommended in all
patients with myopericarditis. [53][,][54][,][66]

Sudden cardiac death cases have been reported in military per
sonnel after strenuous exertion and also in male athletes without
prodromic symptoms [football (soccer) players, swimming]. [53][,][54][,][66]

While in isolated pericarditis, return to exercise is permissible

when there is no further evidence of active disease in non-athletes,

or after 3 months in athletes, the presence or suspicion of myocardial involvement leads to contraindication of physical exercise for at
least 6 months from the onset of the illness according to expert
opinion and previous recommendations for participation in competitive sports. [53][,][54][,][66]

3.4.3 Prognosis
Myocardial involvement in pericarditis has a good prognosis,

and several observational series have demonstrated no

evolution to heart failure or mortality in patients with myopericarditis. [34][,][66] [–] [68][,][70][,][71]

3.5 Pericardial effusion

The normal pericardial sac contains 10–50 ml of pericardial fluid as
a plasma ultrafiltrate that acts as a lubricant between the pericardial


layers. Any pathological process usually causes an inflammation with
the possibility of increased production of pericardial fluid (exudate).
An alternative mechanism of accumulation of pericardial fluid may
be decreased reabsorption due to a general increase in systemic
venous pressure as a result of congestive heart failure or pulmonary
hypertension (transudate). [48] Pericardial effusion may be classified
according to its onset (acute or subacute vs. chronic when lasting
.3 months), distribution (circumferential or loculated), haemodynamic impact (none, cardiac tamponade, effusive-constrictive),
composition (exudate, transudate, blood, rarely air, or gas from bacterial infections) and, in particular, by its size (Table 8) based on a
simple semiquantitative echocardiographic assessment as mild
(,10 mm), moderate (10–20 mm) or large (.20 mm) (Web Figure 2). [48] This semiquantitative assessment has also proven to be useful in estimating the risk of specific aetiology and complications
during follow-up in the setting of pericarditis. [9][,][48][,][51] In the last
20 years, five major surveys have been published on the characteristics of moderate to large pericardial effusions (Web Table 3). [74] [–] [78]

A significant proportion of patients with pericardial effusion are
asymptomatic and pericardial effusion constitutes an incidental
and unexpected finding on X-ray or echocardiogram performed
for other reasons. According to these series, many cases remain
idiopathic in developed countries (up to 50%), while other common
causes include cancer (10–25%), infections (15–30%), iatrogenic
causes (15–20%) and connective tissue diseases (5–15%), whereas
TB is the dominant cause in developing countries (.60%), where
TB is endemic. [52][,][79] In the setting of pericarditis with pericardial effusion, the prevalence of malignant or infectious aetiologies ranges
from 15 to 50% depending on the published series. [6][,][9]

3.5.1 Clinical presentation and diagnosis
The clinical presentation of pericardial effusion varies according to
the speed of pericardial fluid accumulation. If pericardial fluid is rapidly accumulating, such as after wounds or iatrogenic perforations,
the evolution is dramatic and even small amounts of blood may
cause an increase in intrapericardial pressure within minutes and
overt cardiac tamponade. On the other hand, a slow accumulation
of pericardial fluid allows the collection of a large effusion in days to
weeks before a significant increase in pericardial pressure causes
symptoms and signs (Web Figure 3). [48][,][80][,][81]

Classic symptoms include dyspnoea on exertion progressing to
orthopnoea, chest pain and/or fullness. Additional occasional

2934 ESC Guidelines


symptoms due to local compression may include nausea (diaphragm), dysphagia (oesophagus), hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal
nerve) and hiccups (phrenic nerve). Non-specific symptoms include
cough, weakness, fatigue, anorexia and palpitations, and reflect
the compressive effect of the pericardial fluid on contiguous
anatomic structures or reduced blood pressure and secondary sinus
tachycardia. [82] [–] [84] Fever is a non-specific sign that may be associated
with pericarditis, either infectious or immune mediated (i.e. systemic
inflammatory diseases). [45]

Physical examination may be absolutely normal in patients without haemodynamic compromise. When tamponade develops, classic signs include neck vein distension with elevated jugular venous
pressure at bedside examination, pulsus paradoxus and diminished
heart sounds on cardiac auscultation in cases of moderate to large
effusions. [82][ –][ 84] Pericardial friction rubs are rarely heard; they can
usually be detected in patients with concomitant pericarditis. [8]

The diagnosis of pericardial effusion is generally performed by
echocardiography, which also enables semiquantitative assessment
of the pericardial effusion size and its haemodynamic effects. Although echocardiography remains the primary diagnostic tool for
the study of pericardial diseases because of its widespread availability, portability and limited costs, CT and CMR provide a larger field
of view, allowing the detection of loculated pericardial effusion and
pericardial thickening and masses, as well as associated chest
abnormalities. [2][,][3][,][84]


or systemic diseases). Pericardial effusion is often associated with
known or unknown (e.g. hypothyroidism) medical conditions (up
to 60% of cases). [48][,][75][,][82] If inflammatory signs are present, the clinical
management should be that of pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade
without inflammatory signs is associated with a higher risk of a neoplastic aetiology (likelihood ratio 2.9), whereas a severe effusion
without cardiac tamponade and inflammatory signs is usually associated with a chronic idiopathic aetiology (likelihood ratio 20). [75]

A practical routine evaluation for triage of pericardial effusion is
presented in Figure 3. [48][,][82]

3.5.2 Triage and management
When a pericardial effusion is detected, the first step is to assess its
size, haemodynamic importance (especially the presence of cardiac
tamponade) and possible associated diseases (either cardiovascular


In chronic effusion with no definite aetiology, there are no data on
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and
corticosteroids. If markers of inflammation are elevated, a trial

of NSAIDs and/or colchicine and/or low-dose corticosteroids

may be tried.

3.5.3 Therapy
Therapy of pericardial effusion should be targeted at the aetiology as
much as possible. In about 60% of cases, the effusion is associated

with a known disease and the essential treatment is that of the
underlying disease. [48][,][75][,][82] When pericardial effusion is associated
with pericarditis, management should follow that of pericarditis.
When a pericardial effusion becomes symptomatic without evidence of inflammation or when empiric anti-inflammatory drugs
are not successful, drainage of the effusion should be considered.
Pericardiocentesis with prolonged pericardial drainage of up to 30
ml/24 h may be considered in order to promote adherence of pericardial layers and prevent further accumulation of fluid; however,
evidence to support this indication is based on case reports, retrospective studies and expert opinion. [48][,][82][,][84]

Unfortunately, there are no proven effective medical therapies to
reduce an isolated effusion. In the absence of inflammation, NSAIDs,
colchicine and corticosteroids are generally not effective. [82][,][85] Pericardiocentesis alone may be necessary for the resolution of large effusions, but recurrences are also common, and pericardiectomy or
less invasive options (i.e. pericardial window) should be considered
whenever fluid reaccumulates, becomes loculated or biopsy material is required. [48]

ESC Guidelines 2935













3.5.4 Prognosis and follow-up
The prognosis of pericardial effusion is essentially related to the aetiology. [48][,][82][,][86] The size of the effusion is correlated with the prognosis, as moderate to large effusions are more common for specific
aetiologies such as bacterial and neoplastic conditions. [9][,][48] Idiopathic
pericardial effusion and pericarditis have an overall good prognosis
with a very low risk of complications, especially if the effusion is mild
to moderate. In contrast with these observations, a recently published prospective study has shown that even with mild pericardial
effusion the overall prognosis may be worse than in age- and sexmatched controls. [87]

Large idiopathic chronic effusions (.3 months) have a 30–35%
risk of progression to cardiac tamponade. [88] Also, subacute (4–6
weeks) large effusions not responsive to conventional therapy and
with echocardiographic signs of collapse of the right chambers
may have an increased risk of progression according to some
authors, who recommend preventive drainage in such cases. [89]

Documented idiopathic pericarditis has a very low risk of constrictive pericarditis despite several recurrences: here the risk is related
to the aetiology and not the number of recurrences. [36] The followup of pericardial effusion is mainly based on the evaluation of symptoms and the echocardiographic size of the effusion, as well as
additional features such as inflammatory markers (i.e. CRP). [48]

A mild idiopathic effusion (,10 mm) is usually asymptomatic,
generally has a good prognosis and does not require specific monitoring. [48] Moderate to large effusions (.10 mm) may worsen, and
especially severe effusions may evolve towards cardiac tamponade
in up to one-third of cases. For idiopathic moderate effusions, an
appropriate timing for echocardiographic follow-up may be an
echocardiogram every 6 months. For a severe effusion, an echocardiographic follow-up may be every 3–6 months. A tailored followup is also warranted considering the relative stability or evolution of
the size. [48] Specific considerations on pericardial effusion in the postoperative setting are discussed in the section on post-cardiac injury
syndromes (section 5.5).

3.6 Cardiac tamponade

Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening, slow or rapid compression
of the heart due to the pericardial accumulation of fluid, pus, blood,
clots or gas as a result of inflammation, trauma, rupture of the heart
or aortic dissection. [81][,][84] Clinical signs in a patient with cardiac tamponade include tachycardia, hypotension, pulsus paradoxus, raised
jugular venous pressure, muffled heart sounds, decreased electrocardiographic voltage with electrical alternans and an enlarged
cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray with slow-accumulating
effusions. [81] [–] [84] A key diagnostic finding is pulsus paradoxus (conventionally defined as an inspiratory decrease in systolic arterial pressure of .10 mmHg during normal breathing). Pulsus paradoxus is
due to exaggerated ventricular interdependence occurring in
cardiac tamponade, when the overall volume of cardiac chambers
becomes fixed and any change in the volume of one side of the heart
causes the opposite changes in the other side (i.e. inspiratory increase of venous return and right chambers with decreased volume
of left chambers and reduced systemic blood pressure). The magnitude of clinical and haemodynamic abnormalities depends on the
rate of accumulation and amount of pericardial contents, the distensibility of the pericardium and the filling pressures and compliance of
the cardiac chambers (Web Figure 3). Various causes for cardiac tamponade are listed in Table 9.
The stiffness of the pericardium determines fluid increments precipitating tamponade, as illustrated by characteristic pericardial


pressure–volume (strain–stress) curves: there is an initial slow ascent, followed by an almost vertical rise (Web Figure 3). This steep
rise makes tamponade a ‘last-drop’ phenomenon: the final increment produces critical cardiac compression and the first decrement
during drainage produces the largest relative decompression. [80] [–] [84]

In a patient with clinical suspicion of cardiac tamponade, several
diagnostic tools are required. An ECG may show signs of pericarditis, with especially low QRS voltages and electrical alternans. Both
ECG signs are generally considered to be an expression of the
damping effect of pericardial fluid and swinging heart. Echocardiography is the single most useful diagnostic tool to identify pericardial
effusion and estimate its size, location and degree of haemodynamic
impact. Also, echocardiography is used to guide pericardiocentesis
with excellent safety and efficacy. Signs of tamponade can be identified by echocardiography: swinging of the heart, early diastolic collapse of the right ventricle, late diastolic collapse of the right atrium,
abnormal ventricular septal motion, exaggerated respiratory variability (.25%) in mitral inflow velocity, inspiratory decrease and expiratory increase in pulmonary vein diastolic forward flow,
respiratory variation in ventricular chamber size, aortic outflow velocity (echocardiographic pulsus paradoxus) and inferior vena cava
plethora. [2][,][3][,][82][,][84] CT and CMR are often less readily available and
are generally unnecessary unless Doppler echocardiography is not
feasible. Cardiac catheterization is rarely used to diagnose cardiac
tamponade. It will show equilibration of average diastolic pressure
and characteristic respiratory reciprocation of cardiac pressures,
i.e. an inspiratory increase on the right and a concomitant decrease
on the left—the proximate cause of pulsus paradoxus. Except in
low-pressure tamponade, diastolic pressures throughout the heart
are usually in the range of 15–30 mmHg.
The treatment of cardiac tamponade involves drainage of the pericardial fluid, preferably by needle pericardiocentesis, with the use of
echocardiographic or fluoroscopic guidance, and should be performed without delay in unstable patients. Alternatively, drainage is
performed by a surgical approach, especially in some situations
such as purulent pericarditis or in urgent situations with bleeding
into the pericardium. A triage system (Web Figure 4) has been proposed by the ESC Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases in order to guide the timing of the intervention and the
possibility of transferring the patient to a referral centre. [84] This triage
system is essentially based on expert consensus and requires additional validation in order to be recommended in clinical practice.

3.7 Constrictive pericarditis

Constrictive pericarditis can occur after virtually any pericardial disease process, but only rarely follows recurrent pericarditis. [37] The
risk of progression is especially related to the aetiology: low
(,1%) in viral and idiopathic pericarditis, intermediate (2–5%) in
immune-mediated pericarditis and neoplastic pericardial diseases
and high (20–30%) in bacterial pericarditis, especially purulent pericarditis. [36] A few large historical series of patients with constrictive
pericarditis have been described from tertiary referral centres
(Stanford, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic and Groote Schuur Hospital) reporting cases after pericardiectomy (Web Table 4). [90][ –][ 93]

The most common reported causes in developed countries were
idiopathic or viral (42–49%), post-cardiac surgery (11–37%), postradiation therapy (9–31%) (mostly for Hodgkin’s disease or breast
cancer), connective tissue disorder (3–7%), post-infectious causes
(TB or purulent pericarditis in 3–6%) and miscellaneous causes
(malignancy, trauma, drug-induced, asbestosis, sarcoidosis, uraemic
pericarditis in,10%). TB is now only a rare cause of constrictive
pericarditis in developed countries, while it is a major cause in developing countries. [93] However, this disorder may be increasing among
immigrants from underdeveloped nations and patients with HIV

infection.

3.7.1 Clinical presentation
Constrictive pericarditis is characterized by impaired diastolic
filling of the ventricles due to pericardial disease. The classic clinical picture is characterized by signs and symptoms of right heart
failure with preserved right and left ventricular function in the absence of previous or concomitant myocardial disease or advanced
forms. Patients complain about fatigue, peripheral oedema, breathlessness and abdominal swelling. The delay between the initial
pericardial inflammation and the onset of constriction is variable
and is possibly a direct evolution from subacute/chronic pericarditis to constrictive pericarditis. [36] Venous congestion, hepatomegaly, pleural effusions and ascites may occur. Haemodynamic
impairment of the patient can be additionally aggravated by a systolic dysfunction due to myocardial fibrosis or atrophy in more ad
vanced cases.

Although classic and advanced cases show prominent pericardial
thickening and calcifications in chronic forms, constriction may also
be present with normal pericardial thickness in up to 20% of the


cases. [94] Pericardiectomy is equally successful in those with and without increased pericardial thickness.

3.7.2 Diagnosis
A diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is based on the association of
signs and symptoms of right heart failure and impaired diastolic filling
due to pericardial constriction byone or more imaging methods, including echocardiography, [95] CT, CMR, and cardiac catheterization. [2][,][3][,][96] The
main differential diagnosis is with restrictive cardiomyopathy (Table 10).

3.7.3 Therapy
Although the mainstay of treatment of chronic permanent cases is
surgery, medical therapy may have a role in at least three conditions.
First, medical therapy of specific aetiologies (i.e. tuberculous pericarditis) may be useful to prevent the progression to constriction.
Antituberculosis antibiotics may significantly reduce the risk of constriction from .80% to,10%. [79][,][97]

Second, medical therapy (generally based on anti-inflammatory
drugs) may solve the transient constriction occurring in 10–20%
of cases within a few months, generally as a temporary phenomenon
during the resolution of pericarditis. [51][,][98][,][99] The detection of elevated CRP and imaging evidence of pericardial inflammation by contrast enhancement on CT and/or CMR may be helpful to identify
patients with potentially reversible forms of constriction where empiric anti-inflammatory therapy should be considered and may prevent the need for pericardiectomy. [100]

Third, medical therapy is supportive and aimed at controlling
symptoms of congestion in advanced cases and when surgery is contraindicated or at high risk. In these cases, medical therapy should
never delay surgery, if this option is feasible, because advanced cases
have a higher mortality and a worse prognosis if surgery is delayed. [51]

3.7.4 Specific forms
The classic description of chronic permanent constrictive pericarditis has been challenged by specific forms of constrictive syndromes
(i.e. transient constriction, effusive-constrictive forms). Definitions,
main differential diagnoses and treatment of the main constrictive
pericardial syndromes are summarized in Table 11. [51]

3.7.4.1 Transient constrictive pericarditis
A temporary form of constriction usually develops with pericarditis and mild effusion and resolves with anti-inflammatory


therapy within several weeks. [98][,][99] The typical clinical course implies the presence of acute inflammatory pericarditis with constriction due to inflammation, which resolves once the
inflammatory process is treated. [98][,][99] Thus, in the absence of evidence that the condition is chronic (e.g. cachexia, atrial fibrillation,
hepatic dysfunction or pericardial calcification), patients with
newly diagnosed constrictive pericarditis who are haemodynamically stable may be given a trial of conservative management
for 2–3 months before recommending pericardiectomy. Since
the inflamed pericardium is enhanced on CT and/or CMR,

ESC Guidelines 2939


multimodality imaging with CT and CMR may be helpful to detect
pericardial inflammation. [2][,][3][,][100]

3.7.4.2 Effusive-constrictive pericarditis
The pericardial cavity is typically obliterated in patients with
constrictive pericarditis. Thus even the normal amount of pericardial fluid is absent. However, pericardial effusion may be present in some cases. In this setting, the scarred pericardium not
only constricts the cardiac volume, but can also put pericardial
fluid under increased pressure, leading to signs suggestive of cardiac tamponade. This combination is called effusive-constrictive
pericarditis. [101]

Effusive-constrictive pericarditis appears to be relatively uncommon in developing countries, with only limited published data. [101]

Most cases of effusive-constrictive pericarditis in developed countries are idiopathic, reflecting the frequency of idiopathic pericardial disease in general. However, TB is the most common cause in
developing countries. [102] Other reported causes include radiation,
neoplasia, chemotherapy, infection (especially TB and purulent
forms) and post-surgical pericardial disease. [102]

Patients with effusive-constrictive pericarditis usually have clinical features of pericardial effusion or constrictive pericarditis, or
both. The diagnosis of effusive-constrictive pericarditis often
becomes apparent during pericardiocentesis in patients initially
considered to have uncomplicated cardiac tamponade. [101] For
these reasons, it is recommended that intrapericardial pressures,
right heart pressures and systemic arterial blood pressure are
monitored during elective pericardiocentesis whenever possible.
A persistently elevated right atrial pressure after efficient pericardiocentesis may also be due to right heart failure or tricuspid

regurgitation.
However, non-invasive imaging may be equally useful for the diagnosis of effusive-constrictive pericarditis. [102] The epicardial layer of
pericardium, which is responsible for the constrictive component
of this process, is not typically thickened to a degree that is detectable on imaging studies. Nevertheless, careful detection of Doppler
findings of constriction can be reported following pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade, and effusive-constrictive pericarditis
can also be suspected in these cases without haemodynamic monitoring. Useful data may also be provided by CMR. The utility of
CMR in constrictive pericardial disease is well established, providing
the opportunity not only to evaluate pericardial thickness, cardiac
morphology and function, but also for imaging intrathoracic cavity
structures, allowing the differentiation of constrictive pericarditis
from restrictive cardiomyopathy. Assessment of ventricular coupling with real-time cine magnetic resonance during free breathing allows an accurate evaluation of ventricular interdependence and
septal bounce. [2][,][3]

Since it is the visceral layer of pericardium and not the parietal
layer that constricts the heart, visceral pericardiectomy must be
performed. However, the visceral component of the pericardiectomy is often difficult, requiring sharp dissection of many small fragments until an improvement in ventricular motion is observed. Thus
pericardiectomy for effusive-constrictive pericarditis should be performed only at centres with experience in pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis. [101]


3.7.4.3 Chronic constrictive pericarditis
Pericardiectomy is the accepted standard of treatment in patients
with chronic constrictive pericarditis who have persistent and
prominent symptoms such as NYHA class III or IV. However, surgery should be considered cautiously in patients with either mild
or very advanced disease and in those with radiation-induced constriction, myocardial dysfunction or significant renal dysfunction.
Surgical removal of the pericardium has a significant operative mortality ranging from 6 to 12%. [103][ –][ 105] Pericardiectomy must be as
complete as is technically feasible and should be performed by experienced surgeons. Referral to a centre with a special interest in
pericardial disease may be warranted in centres with limited experience in this surgery.
Patients with ‘end-stage’ constrictive pericarditis derive little or
no benefit from pericardiectomy, and the operative risk is inordinately high. Manifestations of end-stage disease include cachexia, atrial fibrillation, a low cardiac output (cardiac index,1.2 l/m [2] /min)
at rest, hypoalbuminaemia due to protein-losing enteropathy and/or
impaired hepatic function due to chronic congestion or cardiogenic

cirrhosis.

Prior ionizing radiation is associated with a poor long-term outcome, because it induces cardiomyopathy as well as pericardial disease. Predictors of poor overall survival are prior radiation, worse
renal function, higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure, abnormal
left ventricular systolic function, lower serum sodium level and older
age. Pericardial calcification had no impact on survival. [103] [–] [105] Survival after radical pericardiectomy in patients with Child–Pugh
(CP) B or C (CP score ≥7) was reported to be significantly worse
than in patients with CP-A. In multivariable analysis, a CP score ≥7,
mediastinal irradiation, age and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) identified an increased risk of death after radical pericardiectomy. [106] On
this basis, it seems appropriate to apply the CP scoring system for
the prediction of mortality after radical pericardiectomy in patients
with constrictive pericarditis.

### 4. Multimodality cardiovascular imaging and diagnostic work-up

4.1 Multimodality imaging
4.1.1 Chest X-ray
Although chest X-ray can detect pericardial calcifications, presenting as a curvilinear density at the extreme margin of the silhouette,
particularly on the lateral view, [107] other techniques (i.e. echocardiography, CT) yield much greater accuracy in assessing the heart and
lungs, providing information with regard to cardiac size and the presence of pulmonary pathology (e.g., pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, TB, lung cancer), pleural effusion and hilar and mediastinal
enlargement.

4.1.2 Echocardiography
Transthoracic echocardiography is the first-line imaging test in patients with suspected pericardial disease, because it accurately detects pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, as well as
ventricular dysfunction due to myocardial involvement. [2][,][3] Although
patients with purely fibrinous acute pericarditis may have a normal
echocardiogram, the presence of a pericardial effusion is consistent
with acute pericarditis and is one of the criteria for its diagnosis. [2][,][5][,][6][,][10][,][11] Echocardiography may help to differentiate acute pericarditis from myocardial ischaemia by excluding wall motion
abnormalities consistent with coronary flow distribution in the setting of patients with acute chest pain. However, ≏5% of patients
with acute pericarditis and myocardial involvement may demon
strate wall motion abnormalities.

Clinically, two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler provides the most cost-effective way of diagnosing pericardial effusion
and assessing its haemodynamic significance. [48] The size of pericardial effusion on two-dimensional echocardiography is qualitatively
assessed by the end-diastolic distance of the echo-free space between the epicardium and parietal pericardium: small (,10 mm),
moderate (10–20 mm), large (.20 mm) (Web Figure 2). [48]

In order to allow follow-up studies, it is recommended that the
images be documented digitally and the effusion size described in
a detailed way in the echocardiographic report, including not only

the extent, but also the location of each measurement. However,

the haemodynamic tolerance is more related to the rapidity of appearance of the effusion than to its total volume. [48][,][80]

Loculated pericardial effusions or pericardial effusions that contain clots (e.g. after cardiac surgery) may be difficult to diagnose
using a transthoracic approach and may require transoesophageal
echocardiography. [3][,][4] Specific findings in pericardial syndromes are
discussed in the pertinent paragraphs.

4.1.3 Computed tomography
CT should be regarded as a valuable complementary imaging modality to echocardiography. [3][,][4][,][41][,][108][,][109] CT is the most accurate technique to image calcified tissue. [2][,][3] Current multidetector CT
scanners combine acquisition speed, high contrast and spatial resolution with volumetric scanning to provide excellent anatomical detail of the heart and pericardium. The anatomical region of interest
covered by CT can be limited to the heart and pericardium (‘cardiac


CT’), although in patients with neoplastic, inflammatory or aortic
disease it may encompass the chest entirely and possibly also include
the abdomen and pelvis. [108][,][109] Low-radiation cardiac CT is feasible
using prospective electrocardiographic triggering. [108][,][109] Although
the functional consequences of pericardial disease on the heart
can be evaluated by CT—at the expense of significantly higher radiation doses—echocardiography and CMR are more appropriate for
assessing this feature. Intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material is recommended to increase the density of blood
and to depict pericardial inflammation. The normal pericardium is
visible as a thin curvilinear structure surrounded by the hypodense
mediastinal and epicardial fat, and has a thickness ranging from 0.7 to
2.0 mm. The pericardial sinuses and their respective recesses are
visible, in particular when they contain small amounts of pericardial
fluid. The main CT findings in pericardial effusion and pericarditis are
summarized in Table 12. [41][,][108][,][109]

In patients with neoplastic disease, pericardial involvement may
occur by direct tumour invasion or metastatic spread. CT is important in treatment planning and patient follow-up. The diagnosis of
(congenital) pericardial cysts—presenting as well-defined, fluiddense structures along the left or right heart border—as well as
the differential diagnosis with other cystic structures, such as bronchogenic or duplication cysts, is usually straightforward. Finally, CT
can be helpful to establish the diagnosis in congenital absence of the
pericardium by showing displacement of cardiac structures through
the pericardial defect. CT is also essential in the preoperative workup of some patients with constrictive pericarditis, especially to depict the extension of calcifications and for those with a history of
prior cardiothoracic surgery. [109]

4.1.4 Cardiac magnetic resonance
Over the years, CMR has shifted from a morphologic imaging modality towards a comprehensive one, allowing visualization and tissue characterization of the pericardium (and heart) in patients
with pericardial disease and appraisal of the consequences of pericardial abnormalities on cardiac function and filling patterns. [110][,][111]

As such, it is probably the preferred imaging modality to optimally
assess pericardial disease. [112][,][113] Cardiac and pericardial morphology are evaluated by dark-blood T1-weighted fast spin-echo and
bright-blood cine steady-state free-precession (SSFP) imaging.
Cine SSFP imaging has become the reference sequence to assess
and quantify cardiac volumes, myocardial mass and ventricular function. When acquired in real-time, this sequence can be used to assess ventricular coupling by assessing the changes in ventricular
septal shape and motion over the respiratory cycle. [109][,][110] Tissue
characterization of the heart and pericardium is achieved by darkblood T1-weighted and dark-blood T2-weighted, short-tau
inversion-recovery (STIR) spin-echo imaging, cine SSFP imaging
and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced and/or late contrast-enhanced
(LCE) imaging following intravenous administration of paramagnetic
gadolinium chelates. [3][,][4][,][114] The LCE sequence uses an inversionrecovery pre-pulse to increase image contrast and is well suited
to visualize pericardial inflammation. [114][,][115]

Ventricular inflow and venous flow patterns can be evaluated
using phase contrast imaging. [111] Similar to CT, the normal

pericardium appears on T1-weighted imaging as a thin hypointense
(‘dark’) curvilinear structure surrounded by hyperintense (‘bright’)
mediastinal and epicardial fat. Normal pericardial thickness ranges
from 1.2 to 1.7 mm. The imaging characteristics of pericardial effusion and pericarditis at CMR are shown in Table 12. It should be emphasized that CMR can accurately distinguish between mixed
myopericardial diseases such as mixed inflammatory forms (e.g.
myopericarditis or perimyocarditis) and post-myocardial infarction
pericardial injury. [116][,][117] In patients with constrictive pericarditis,
CMR is particularly important in the diagnosis of atypical presentations, such as those with minimally thickened pericardium or
effusive-constrictive pericarditis, and those with potentially reversible or transient forms of constrictive pericarditis, showing enhancement of the pericardial layers at LCE imaging. [115][,][118][,][119] Compared
with CT, CMR has the advantage of providing information with regard to the haemodynamic consequences of the non-compliant
pericardium on cardiac filling, [109] [–] [111] and has the potential of showing fibrotic fusion of pericardial layers. [120]

In patients with congenital pericardial pathology and pericardial
malignancy, CMR shares the advantages of CT, but allows better tissue characterization and the possibility of evaluating the functional
consequences. [121] Moreover, novel techniques, such as diffusionweighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging, open perspectives for improved tissue characterization in
patients with pericardial tumours. [122]

4.1.5 Nuclear medicine

In selected cases, positron emission tomography (PET) alone, or
preferably in combination with CT (PET/CT), can be indicated to
depict the metabolic activity of pericardial disease. Pericardial uptake of [18] F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer in patients with solid
cancers and lymphoma is indicative of (malignant) pericardial involvement, thus providing essential information on the diagnosis,
staging and assessment of the therapeutic response. [123] The uptake
is usually intense and often associated with a focal soft tissue
mass. [124] PET/CT is also of value in identifying the nature of inflammatory pericarditis. In particular, tuberculous pericarditis yields
higher FDG uptakes than idiopathic forms. [125] However, differentiation between benign and malignant pericardial disease, as well as
differentiation between physiological and pathological cardiac
FDG uptake by PET/CT, remains challenging. [123]

4.1.6 Cardiac catheterization

Cardiac catheterization is not routinely used for the diagnosis of
pericardial disease, as current non-invasive techniques are usually
able to solve the differential diagnosis of a patient with the suspicion
of heart disease involving the pericardium. However, right heart
catheterization may be useful in certain circumstances. Early recognition of abnormal haemodynamics related to cardiac tamponade
during invasive procedures (i.e. epicardial ablation, percutaneous
aortic valve implantation, complex angioplasty or complex procedures involving trans-septal punctures, among others) may help
avoid serious consequences for the patient. In addition, the differentiation between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy is sometimes difficult and may require an invasive test.


In cardiac tamponade, the right atrial pressure waveform has an
attenuated or an absent Y-descent. Absent Y-descent is secondary
to diastolic equalization of pressures in the right atrium and right
ventricle and lack of effective flow across the tricuspid valve in early
ventricular diastole. Also, equalization of mean right atrial, right ventricular and pulmonary artery diastolic pressures and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressures can be present. Other haemodynamic
abnormalities include elevation of filling pressures in all four cardiac
chambers, right ventricle and left ventricle peak systolic pressures
out of phase, peak aortic pressure varying more than 10–12
mmHg and a decrease in cardiac output. [126][,][127]

The differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive
cardiomyopathy remains difficult. Visualization of the pericardium
by CT or CMR may help in detecting an abnormal pericardium.
But these tests provide anatomical information and do not necessarily reflect the pathophysiological abnormality present. Also, patients
with surgically proven constrictive pericarditis may have a normalappearing pericardium on imaging studies. Alternatively patients
may have abnormal pericardial thickness in the absence of constriction, especially after radiation therapy or prior cardiac surgery. Classically, direct measurements of pressures show M- or W-shaped
atrial pressure waveforms and ‘square root’ or ‘dip-and-plateau’
right ventricular pressure waveforms, reflecting impaired ventricular
filling. End-diastolic pressure equalization (typically within 5 mmHg)
occurs between these cardiac chambers in constrictive pericarditis
because of the fixed and limited space within the thickened and stiff
pericardium. Pulmonary artery systolic pressures are usually normal
in pericardial constriction; higher pulmonary pressures suggest a restrictive cardiomyopathy. [126]

Recently a novel haemodynamic parameter has been tested to
differentiate both entities. [96] Specifically, the ratio of the right ventricular to left ventricular systolic pressure–time area during inspiration versus expiration (systolic area index) was used as a
measurement of enhanced ventricular interaction. In patients with
surgically documented constrictive pericarditis, during inspiration
there is an increase in the area of the right ventricular pressure curve
compared with expiration. The area of the left ventricular pressure
curve decreases during inspiration as compared with expiration. In
contrast, patients with restrictive myocardial disease documented
by endomyocardial biopsy usually present a decrease in the area
of the right ventricular pressure curve during inspiration as compared with expiration. The area of the left ventricular pressure curve
is unchanged during inspiration as compared with expiration. This
systolic area index presented a 97% sensitivity and 100% predictive
accuracy for identifying patients with surgically proven constrictive
pericarditis. [96]

4.1.7 Multimodality imaging
Echocardiography, cardiac CT and CMR are often used as complementary imaging modalities (Table 13). The choice of one or multiple imaging modalities is driven by the clinical context or
condition of the patient. A modern approach for the management
of pericardial diseases should include the integration of different imaging modalities in order to improve the diagnostic accuracy and
clinical management of patients. [2][,][3]

4.2 Proposal for a general diagnostic
work-up

In the management of pericardial syndromes, a major controversy
is the role of an extensive aetiological search and admission for
all patients with pericarditis or pericardial effusion. [1][,][4][,][6][,][51]


The epidemiological background is essential to develop a rational
cost-effective management programme and the clinician should especially identify causes that require targeted therapies. [4][,][5][,][51][,][128][ –] [130]

The approach may be different for research, when we attempt to
reduce the number of ‘idiopathic’ cases. The diagnosis of idiopathic
cases is essentially an exclusion diagnosis, supported by a typical

clinical course.

On this basis, auscultation, ECG, echocardiography, chest X-ray,
routine blood tests, including markers of inflammation (i.e.,
CRP and/or ESR) and myocardial lesions (CK, troponins), are
recommended in all cases of suspected pericarditis. Additional
testing should be related to the suspected origin and clinical
presentation. [5][,][6][,][128] [–] [130]

The major specific causes to be ruled out are bacterial pericarditis (especially TB), neoplastic pericarditis and pericarditis associated with a systemic disease (generally an autoimmune disease)
(Web Table 5). [9][,][77][,][129][ –][ 131] Each of these specific causes has a
frequency of ≏5% of all unselected cases of pericarditis from
developed countries (Web Table 5), [9][,][77][,][129][ –][ 131] while frequencies
increase in moderate to large pericardial effusions (Web
Table 3). [8][,][74][ –][ 78] Emerging additional causes include iatrogenic
ones (percutaneous coronary interventions, pacemaker insertion,
catheter ablation). [132] The aetiological spectrum is different in
developing countries with a high prevalence of TB (e.g. 70–80%
of pericarditis in sub-Saharan Africa, and often associated with
HIV infection). [52][,][79]

Certain clinical features at presentation may be associated with
an increased risk of specific aetiologies (non-viral or nonidiopathic) and complications during follow-up (recurrences,
tamponade, constriction) and are suggested as ‘high-risk features’
useful for the triage of pericarditis to establish the need for a full
aetiological search and admission in a single patient (Figure 1, Web
Table 6). [8][,][9] Factors indicated as ‘major’ have been validated by
multivariate analysis, while factors indicated as ‘minor’ are based
on expert opinion and literature review: [9] they are essentially theoretical risk factors for complications and suggest the indication
for admission and close monitoring of the evolution. Major risk
factors include fever .388C [hazard ratio (HR) 3.56], subacute
course (symptoms developing over several days or weeks; HR
3.97), large pericardial effusion (diastolic echo-free space
.20 mm in width) or cardiac tamponade (HR 2.15) and failure
of aspirin or NSAIDs (HR 2.50). [9] Large effusion and tamponade
(HR 2.51) and aspirin or NSAIDs failure (HR 5.50) also identify
an increased risk of complications during follow-up (recurrences,
tamponade, constriction). [9] Minor risk factors are pericarditis associated with myocarditis, immunodepression, trauma and oral
anticoagulant therapy.
For patients with predictors of poor prognosis, major or minor (Figure 1), hospitalization and a full aetiological search are
warranted. [5][,][6][,][8][,][9][,][128] In contrast, when these negative predictors
are absent, patients are at low risk of specific causes and complications, and outpatient management may be considered. [8] This
approach is safe without an excess of complications and new
unexpected diagnoses requiring a specific therapy. [8][,][9][,][128] The

same approach is also useful for patients with recurrences who
may generally be treated as outpatients, unless predictors of
poor prognosis are present or a specific cause can be ruled

at each recurrence unless new clinical features become evident.

often presents as a self-limited disease, with most patients recovering without complications. [5][,][6][,][9][,][36] However, as a consequence of
acute viral pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, recurrent pericarditis
and, more rarely, constrictive pericarditis may also develop. [36]

5.1.3 Pathogenesis
Cardiotropic viruses can cause pericardial and myocardial inflammation via direct cytolytic or cytotoxic effects (e.g. enteroviruses) and/
or via T and/or B cell–driven immune-mediated mechanisms (e.g.


herpesviruses). Persistence of viral nucleic acid without virus replication in the peri(myo)cardium is known to sustain ongoing inflammation and effusions via (auto)immune processes directed against
specific cardiac proteins by molecular mimicry. [133]

5.1.4 Diagnosis
The definite diagnosis of viral pericarditis requires a comprehensive
workup of histological, cytological, immunohistological and molecular investigations in pericardial fluid and peri-/epicardial biopsies

2946 ESC Guidelines


obtained in conjunction with pericardioscopy, permitting the evaluation of possible algorithms for a causative therapy. [133] In contrast,
serological tests were found to be futile in the diagnosis of viral pericarditis. Whereas no up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine
expression is noted in the serum, TNF-a, vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), IL-6,
IL-8 and interferon-gamma (IFN-g) are increased in the pericardial
effusions of patients with pericarditis, indicating the presence of local inflammatory reactions. [134][,][135] Accordingly, there is no correl
ation of antiviral antibodies in the serum or virus isolation from

throat or rectal swabs with positive molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/in situ hybridization analyses for the detection of cardiotropic viruses in pericardial tissue and fluid. [136]

5.1.5 Identification of viral nucleic acids
Mainly by quantitative PCR techniques, nucleic acids of different
cardiotropic RNA and DNA viruses have been detected in
epicardial and pericardial biopsies and the pericardial fluid of children and adults with acute pericarditis, but also in patients with recurring and constrictive pericarditis. [133][,][137] Regarding RNA
viruses, various subtypes of enteroviruses including echoviruses
and coxsackieviruses of groups A (A4, A16) and B (CVB2,
CVB3, CVB4) were identified in patients with acute and constrictive pericarditis. [137][,][138] Among the RNA viruses, influenza A viruses
(e.g. H1N1, H5N1, H3N2) and occasionally chikungunya virus, human coronavirus NL-63, respiratory syncytial virus and dengue
virus infections were suspected as aetiopathogenic agents in
pericarditis.
Compared with RNA viruses, nucleic acids of DNA viruses, including parvovirus B19 and herpesviruses [Epstein–Barr virus
(EBV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6)], are present in pericardial
biopsies and pericardial fluid at greater frequencies and higher viral
DNA copy numbers. [133] Whereas parvovirus B19, with up to 7 ×
10 [6] GE/lg DNA was predominantly detected in epicardial tissue,
EBV was most frequently found in pericardial fluid. [133] DNA of
varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus and adenoviruses is
only rarely detected in pericarditis patients. Cytomegalovirus
(CMV)-associated pericarditis is mainly found in immunocompromised and HIV patients. [1] In developing countries with a delayed rollout of antiretroviral therapy, HIV-associated inflammatory reactions
(often related to TB) of the pericardium and myocardium are common complications. [139] However, at present these investigations are
usually not performed because of their complexity, cost, invasive nature and low availability.

5.1.6 Therapy
Acute viral pericarditis often presents as a self-limiting disease
that responds well to a short course of treatment with NSAIDs,
with the adjunct of colchicine, especially for prevention of
recurrences. [4] [–] [6][,][50][,][58][,][59] The identification of specific viral signatures
aids in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms in pericarditis,
and might enable an individualized aetiologically driven specific
treatment approach to be established by distinguishing a viral aetiology from autoreactive inflammation. [133] Some experts suggest
antiviral treatment similar to that for myocarditis (IVIG therapy in
acute systemic enteroviral, CMV, EBV and parvovirus B19 infection,


oral valganciclovir in HHV-6 perimyocarditis, IFN-a for enteroviral
pericarditis). [133] However, these treatments are still under evaluation and rarely used. Involvement of infectious disease specialists
is recommended. So far, no therapy is available to solve the problem
of virus persistence and consecutive inflammation, particularly when
induced by herpesviruses and parvovirus B19 infections. [133] Importantly, corticosteroids are generally not indicated in viral pericarditis,
as they are known to reactivate many virus infections and thus lead
to ongoing inflammation. [133]

5.2 Bacterial pericarditis

Bacterial pericarditis is relatively uncommon in clinical practice in
developed countries with a low prevalence of TB. Tuberculous peri
carditis is the most common form all over the world and the most

common cause of pericardial diseases in developing countries. We
will discuss this form and also purulent pericarditis, which is less

common.

5.2.1 Tuberculous pericarditis
Tuberculous pericarditis accounts for ≤4% of pericardial disease in
the developed world. [5][,][6][,][52] . In contrast, TB is the cause of clinically
significant pericardial effusion in .90% of HIV-infected and 50–
70% of non-HIV-infected individuals who live in developing countries where TB is endemic. [77] The disease can occur at any age,
and men are affected more frequently than women. [140] Clinical evidence of chronic cardiac compression mimicking congestive heart
failure is the most common presentation. [79][,][93] Clinical presentations
are pericardial effusion, effusive-constrictive pericarditis and constrictive pericarditis. [79] Tuberculous pericarditis has a mortality
rate of 17–40% at 6 months after diagnosis. [141] It should be emphasized that the majority of the information on tuberculous

pericarditis comes from endemic areas in underdeveloped countries and immunodepressed patients. The applicability of this information to the Western world is questionable.

5.2.1.1 Diagnosis
A ‘definite’ diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis is based on the
presence of tubercle bacilli in the pericardial fluid or on histological
section of the pericardium, by culture or by PCR (Xpert MTB/RIF)
testing; a ‘probable’ diagnosis is made when there is proof of TB
elsewhere in a patient with unexplained pericarditis, a lymphocytic
pericardial exudate with elevated unstimulated interferon-gamma
(uIFN-g), adenosine deaminase (ADA) or lysozyme levels and/or
an appropriate response to antituberculosis chemotherapy in endemic areas. [79] uIFN-g offers superior accuracy for the diagnosis
of microbiologically confirmed tuberculous pericarditis compared
with the ADA assay and the Xpert MTB/RIF test. [142] A protocol
for the evaluation of suspected tuberculous pericardial effusion is
proposed in Table 17.

5.2.1.2 Management
A regimen consisting of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for at least 2 months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin
(total of 6 months of therapy) is effective in treating extrapulmonary


TB. Treatment for ≥9 months gives no better results and has the
disadvantages of increased cost and increased risk of poor
compliance. [143]

The evolution towards constrictive pericarditis is a serious potential complication. Constriction generally develops within 6 months
of presentation with effusive pericarditis (effusive-constrictive pericarditis). [79] Tuberculous pericardial constriction is almost always associated with pericardial thickening. Prior to the introduction of
effective TB chemotherapy, up to 50% of patients with effusive tuberculous pericarditis progressed to constriction. Rifampicin-based

antituberculosis treatment reduced the incidence of constriction to

17–40%. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential to prevent this
progression. [79][,][144] In addition, two interventions may reduce the incidence of constriction: the first is intrapericardial urokinase [145] and
second, the Investigation of the Management of Pericarditis (IMPI)
trial has shown that high-dose adjunctive prednisolone reduces
the incidence of constrictive pericarditis by 46% regardless of HIV
status. [97]

Adjunctive corticosteroid therapy with prednisolone for 6 weeks

had a neutral effect on the combined outcome of death from all

causes, cardiac tamponade requiring pericardiocentesis or pericardial constriction; however, this therapy was associated with an
increased risk of HIV-associated malignancies in the prednisolone

treated group. [97] Adjunctive steroid therapy was associated with a
reduced incidence of pericardial constriction and hospitalization.
The beneficial effects of prednisolone on constriction and hospitalization were similar in HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. On
this basis, it may be reasonable to use adjunctive corticosteroids
in patients with tuberculous pericarditis without HIV infection and

to avoid them in HIV-infected individuals because of the increased
risk of malignancy. [97]


5.2.2 Purulent pericarditis
5.2.2.1 Epidemiology
Purulent pericarditis is rare, accounting for,1% of cases. [5][,][6] In Western series, the most common organisms have been staphylococci,
streptococci and pneumococci, while the predominant associated lesions were empyema (50%) or pneumonia (33%). [146] In immunosuppressed patients or following thoracic surgery, Staphylococcus aureus
(30%) and fungi (20%) are more common. [147] Also, anaerobes originating from the oropharynx have been reported. [148] Seeding may be
haematogenous or by contiguous spread from the retropharyngeal
space, cardiac valves and below the diaphragm. [149] Neisseria meningitidis may involve the pericardium either through initiating an immunemediated sterile effusion or by direct infection and purulent reaction.
The modern era of iatrogenic and HIV-associated immunosuppression has witnessed more unusual organisms.

5.2.2.2 Diagnosis
Purulent pericarditis is rare and generally manifested as a serious
febrile disease. The underlying sepsis may predominate the
illness. [146] [–] [149] Suspicion of purulent pericarditis is an indication for
urgent pericardiocentesis, [1][,][5][,][12] which is diagnostic. The fluid may
be frankly purulent. A low pericardial:serum glucose ratio (mean
0.3) and elevated pericardial fluid white cell count with a high proportion of neutrophils (mean cell count 2.8/ml, 92% neutrophils)
differentiate purulent from tuberculous (glucose ratio 0.7, count
1.7/ml, 50% neutrophils) and neoplastic (glucose ratio 0.8, count
3.3/ml, 55% neutrophils) pericarditis. [150] Fluid should be sent for bacterial, fungal and tuberculous studies, with blood for cultures and
other samples being taken as guided by the clinical presentation. [12]

5.2.2.3 Management
Purulent pericarditis should be managed aggressively, as death is inevitable if untreated, whereas with comprehensive therapy 85% of cases
have been reported to survive the episode and have a good long-term
outcome. [50][,][146] Intravenous antimicrobial therapy should be started
empirically until microbiological results are available. Drainage is crucial.
Purulent effusions are often heavily loculated and likely to rapidly reaccumulate. Intrapericardial thrombolysis is a possible treatment for
cases with loculated effusions in order to achieve adequate drainage before resorting to surgery. [151] Subxiphoid pericardiostomy and rinsing of
the pericardial cavity should be considered. [1] This allows more complete drainage of the effusion, as loculations can be manually lysed.

5.3 Pericarditis in renal failure

Renal disease and overall ESRD are associated with possible
pericardial involvement. [152] Three different pathologies are found
in uraemic patients: uraemic pericarditis—before renal replacement therapy or within 8 weeks of its initiation; dialysis pericarditis—after being stabilized on dialysis (usually ≥8 weeks after its
initiation) [153] and, very rarely, constrictive pericarditis. The global
incidence of pericarditis in ESDR patients has declined to ≏5%
in those patients starting dialysis. [152] The reported frequency of
dialysis pericarditis ranges from 2 to 21%, but recent data are
lacking.
Pericardial involvement in ESRD is manifested most commonly as
acute pericarditis and chronic pericardial effusion and infrequently
as chronic constrictive pericarditis. Typical features of this form of
pericarditis include a lower rate of pleuritic chest pain (up to 30%
of patients are asymptomatic) and the absence of ECG abnormalities in most cases, probably due to the lack of myocardial inflammation. [152] [–] [154] Patients with ESRD are more likely to develop chronic
pericardial effusion due to continuous volume overload. [152] Not all
pericardial effusions result from inflammation, and the normal volume of pericardial fluid is larger in stable haemodialysis patients
than in normal controls. [155] With the advent of advanced renal re
placement therapy, the incidence of haemodynamically significant
effusions has decreased. [152][,][156][,][157] The most probable cause of uraemic pericarditis is the retention of toxic metabolites. [152][,][157] Since
pericardial effusion is often bloody in uraemic patients, anticoagulation should be carefully considered or avoided in patients starting
dialysis. [152][,][157]


5.4 Pericardial involvement in systemic
autoimmune and autoinflammatory
diseases

Pericardial involvement in systemic autoimmune diseases may be
symptomatic (pericarditis and symptomatic pericardial effusion)
or asymptomatic (usually pericardial effusion) and generally reflects the degree of activity of the underlying disease. [45] Approximately 5–15% of patients with acute or recurrent pericarditis
may have a systemic autoimmune disease, either overt or underlying (Table 1, Web Table 5). [9][,][77][,][129][ –][ 131] Pericardial involvement is
common in systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjo¨gren’s syndrome,
rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma, but may also be present in
systemic vasculitides, Behc¸et’s syndrome, sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel diseases. Pericardial involvement rarely occurs as
the first manifestation of these diseases. In most patients the
underlying disease has already been diagnosed by classical symptoms and signs. Concomitant myocardial inflammatory involvement may complicate the presentation and should be ruled out.
If clinical features suggest a possible systemic autoimmune disease,
a targeted aetiological search is warranted in cooperation with
specialist consultation. The treatment is especially targeted at control of the systemic underlying disease. [45]

A specific subset of patients includes those with periodic fevers.
These are genetic disorders characterized by mutations of genes involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response, without involvement of specific T cells or autoantibodies. [158][ –][ 161] These
disorders are usually detected in the paediatric population, although
some patients experience disease onset during adulthood. The most

2950 ESC Guidelines


common autoinflammatory syndromes include familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), in which serositis episodes last only 1–3 days,
and tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome
(TRAPS), in which the episodes last for weeks. Mutations associated
with these disorders are rare in recurrent pericarditis. [158] [–] [161] These
conditions may be characterized by an exaggerated expression of
IL-1. [161] A 10% rate of familial occurrence of pericarditis has been reported among the relatives of these patients. [162] [–] [164] These data suggest a genetic predisposition in at least a subset of patients;
counselling may be warranted in these cases. A positive family history for pericarditis or periodic fevers, a poor response to colchicine, as well as the need for immunosuppressive agents are clues
to the possible presence of an auto-inflammatory disease; [160] particularly in these conditions, anti-IL-1 or anti-TNF agents may be
considered. [31][,][32][,][160]

5.5 Post-cardiac injury syndromes

The term post-cardiac injury syndromes (PCIS) is an umbrella term
indicating a group of inflammatory pericardial syndromes including
post-myocardial infarction pericarditis, post-pericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) and post-traumatic pericarditis (either iatrogenic or
not). [132] Such syndromes are presumed to have an autoimmune
pathogenesis triggered by initial damage to pericardial and/or pleural
tissues caused by either myocardial necrosis (late post-myocardial
infarction pericarditis or Dressler syndrome), surgical trauma
(PPS), accidental thoracic trauma (traumatic pericarditis) or iatrogenic trauma with or without bleeding (pericarditis after invasive
cardiac interventions). [131] The immune-mediated pathogenesis is
supported by a latent period generally of a few weeks until the appearance of the first manifestations and the response to antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids, colchicine) with the
possibility of recurrences. Pericardial bleeding and pleura incision
are triggers for the syndrome. [165][,][166] Some forms, such as Dressler
syndrome, have become rare with early reperfusion therapy of myocardial infarction; however, it may occur especially in cases of even
minor bleeding into the pericardium. [167]

5.5.1 Definition and diagnosis
According to proposed diagnostic criteria for PPS, [168] [–] [170] the diagnosis of PCIS may be reached after a cardiac injury following clinical
criteria: (i) fever without alternative causes, (ii) pericarditic or pleuritic chest pain, (iii) pericardial or pleural rubs, (iv) evidence of pericardial effusion and/or (v) pleural effusion with elevated CRP. At
least two of five criteria should be fulfilled. The rationale for proposing specific criteria instead of adopting the same for pericarditis is
that these syndromes may have concomitant pleuropericardial involvement and possible pulmonary infiltrates, and are not simply
pericarditis. [170] Moreover, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate
PCIS from the simple mechanical consequences of surgery (such
as pericardial or pleural effusion). The demonstration of inflammatory activity should be essential to establish the diagnosis. Basic diagnostic evaluation of a patient with a suspected PCIS includes physical
examination, ECG, echocardiogram, thoracic echography and/or
chest X-ray. [132][,][165] On this basis, echocardiography is recommended
when an iatrogenic complication is suspected after a cardiovascular
intervention. [2][,][3][,][132]


5.5.2 Management
Treatment of PCIS is essentially based on empiric anti-inflammatory
therapy, and may improve remission rates and reduce the risk of
recurrences. [171] The same therapeutic scheme adopted for pericarditis is efficacious for all these forms, including post-myocardial
infarction pericarditis (Table 3). Colchicine is not recommended
for postoperative effusions in the absence of systemic inflammation. [172] [–] [174] Similarly NSAIDs are generally not indicated in asymptomatic post-surgical effusions, and this therapy may be associated
with an increased risk of side effects related to NSAIDs. [173][,][174]

5.5.3 Prevention

Different preventive strategies have been examined in a few studies
regarding aspirin, [175] methylprednisone, [176] dexamethasone [177] and
colchicine. [168][,][169][,][172] Four controlled clinical trials for primary prevention of PPS were included in a systematic review on 894 patients;
three studies were double-blind RCTs. Treatment comparisons
were colchicine vs. placebo (two RCTs enrolling 471 patients),
methylprednisolone vs. placebo (one RCT involving 246 paediatric
patients) and aspirin vs. historical controls (one non-randomized
study involving 177 paediatric patients). Meta-analytic pooling
showed that only colchicine was associated with decreased risk of
PPS [odds ratio (OR) 0.38]. Data on methylprednisolone (OR
1.13) and aspirin (OR 1.00) were negative. [178] The Colchicine for
Prevention of the Post-pericardiotomy Syndrome and Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation (COPPS-2) trial confirmed the overall
efficacy of perioperative use of colchicine, but it was also found to
be associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects [172]

compared with postoperative use of colchicine. [169] Colchicine is not
recommended for the perioperative treatment and prevention of
postoperative effusions in the absence of systemic inflammation. [172]

In another trial, [177] high-dose dexamethasone (1 mg/kg as a single intraoperative dose) was not efficacious in preventing PPS or compli
cated PPS.

5.5.4 Prognosis
Despite limited published data, the prognosis of PPS is generally
good. [178] There are very few available data on other forms of postpericardial injury syndromes. In the largest published series on PPS
patients after cardiac surgery, [166] complication rates were low:,4%
for recurrences,,2% for cardiac tamponade and no cases of constriction, although hospital stay may be prolonged in these patients.
However, the development of constrictive pericarditis has been reported in ≏3% of cases. [36]

5.5.4.1 Post-myocardial infarction pericarditis
Following an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), three major pericardial complications may occur: (i) pericardial effusion, (ii) early
infarct-associated pericarditis (often called early post-infarction
pericarditis, typically a few days after AMI) and (iii) late pericarditis
or post-cardiac injury (Dressler) syndrome (typically 1–2 weeks
after AMI).
Early post-infarction pericarditis usually occurs soon after the
AMI and is transient. This complication is rare in the primary percutaneous coronary intervention era and is especially related to late
reperfusion or failed coronary reperfusion. [167] Diagnostic criteria
do not differ from those for acute pericarditis. ECG changes are

ESC Guidelines 2951


usually overshadowed by changes due to the myocardial infarction.
However, ST segments may remain elevated, with persistence of upright T waves, as T waves may become upright again after having
been inverted. Echocardiography should be performed in patients
suspected of having post-AMI to evaluate for the presence of a pericardial effusion. CMR can be used to show the presence of concomitant pericardial inflammation. [179] Patients with a post-AMI
pericardial effusion .10 mm in thickness should be investigated
for a possible subacute rupture. [180][,][181] The treatment is generally
supportive, as most cases are self-limited. However, a minority of
patients may have persistent symptoms that require more than supportive care. For these patients, aspirin plus colchicine may be

considered.

Late post-AMI pericarditis (Dressler syndrome) is rare (,1%)
in the era of primary percutaneous coronary intervention and
may reflect a larger size of AMI and/or late reperfusion. [167] Diagnosis and treatment are similar to that generally recommended

for PCIS.

Although pericarditis is associated with a larger infarct size, inhospital and 1-year mortality and major adverse cardiac events
were similar in patients with and without pericarditis. Timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention may reduce the occurrence of post-AMI pericarditis. Early post-AMI pericarditis remains
a marker of larger infarct size, but without independent prognostic
significance. [167]

5.5.4.2 Postoperative effusions
Postoperative pericardial effusions are relatively common after cardiac surgery. They usually disappear in 7–10 days, but sometimes
they persist for longer and can be dangerous. Early post-cardiac surgery pericardial collections must be interpreted in the clinical context of the patient. They have been reported as asymptomatic in
22% of patients 2 weeks after cardiac surgery. [182] The prognosis is
good for mild effusions occurring in two of three cases, but moderate to large effusions (one of three) may progress to cardiac tamponade in ≏10% of cases 1 month after cardiac surgery. [182][,][183]

Treatment of these asymptomatic effusions by diclofenac was
shown to be useless in the Post-Operative Pericardial Effusion
(POPE) trial and may be associated with an increased risk of side effects related to NSAID use. [173] In contrast, cardiac tamponade occurring in the first hours after cardiac surgery is usually due to
haemorrhage in the pericardial space, and surgical reintervention
is mandatory in this situation.

5.6 Traumatic pericardial effusion and
haemopericardium

Any cardiac intervention (e.g. percutaneous coronary intervention,
pacemaker lead insertion, radiofrequency ablation) may be responsible for haemopericardium and cardiac tamponade due to coronary or cardiac chamber perforation. Pericardial effusion induced
by trauma is included in the more expanded concept of PCIS. [132]

However, in the event of overt chest trauma complicated by cardiac
tamponade, the magnitude of the trauma is the main cause of the
syndrome. Diagnosis includes the presence of a prior history of
chest trauma as a trigger for the syndrome plus the signs and symptoms of pericarditis (i.e. chest pain, pericardial rub, dyspnoea, lowgrade fever) and markers of inflammatory reaction (i.e. elevated
CRP, leucocytosis, ESR). ECG is normally used to rule out AMI as
a possible cause of pericarditis. Chest X-ray may help to detect cardiomegaly and pleural effusions. Transthoracic echocardiography is
used to detect the presence, size and haemodynamic importance of
the pericardial effusion. A recent randomized trial demonstrated
that the use of limited transthoracic echocardiography improved
the time from the trauma bay to the operating room and reduced
the mortality rate. [184]

Therefore treatment differs according to the severity of the syndrome. For those with post-traumatic pericarditis with no haemodynamic compromise, treatment is essentially based on empirical
anti-inflammatory therapy and adjunctive colchicine, which has
been shown to be safe and efficacious for the prevention of pericarditis. [57] For those life-threatening cases of penetrating trauma to the
heart and chest, emergency thoracotomy is recommended to improve survival as opposed to the classic strategy of initial

pericardiocentesis as a bridge to surgery. [185][,][186] This is usually done
through left anterolateral thoracotomy that makes pericardiotomy
possible with effective relief of cardiac tamponade and direct cardiac
massage if needed.
In the setting of aortic dissection with haemopericardium and suspicion of cardiac tamponade, emergency transthoracic echocardiography or a CT scan should be performed to confirm the
diagnosis. In such a scenario, controlled pericardial drainage of
very small amounts of the haemopericardium can be attempted to
temporarily stabilize the patient in order to maintain blood pressure
at ≏90 mmHg. [187]

5.7 Pericardial involvement in neoplastic
disease

The differential diagnosis between malignant processes and other
causes of pericarditis is particularly relevant and generally is accomplished by imaging, e.g. CT scan, cytology of pericardial fluid
and eventually biopsies. Primary tumours of the pericardium, either benign (lipomas and fibromas) or malignant (mesotheliomas,
angiosarcomas, fibrosarcomas), are very rare. [188][,][189] Mesothelioma, the most common malignant tumour, is almost always incurable. The most common secondary malignant tumours are lung
cancer, breast cancer, malignant melanoma, lymphomas and leukaemias. Malignant pericardial effusions may be small, medium
or large, with an imminent tamponade (frequent recurrences)
or constriction; they may even be the initial sign of malignant


disease. [190] The diagnosis is based on confirmation of the malignant infiltration within the pericardium. [188][,][189] Of note, in almost
two-thirds of patients with documented malignancy, pericardial
effusion is caused by non-malignant diseases, e.g. radiation pericarditis, other therapies or opportunistic infections. [189] Chest
X-ray, CT, PET and CMR may reveal mediastinal widening, hilar
masses and pleural effusion. Analyses of pericardial fluid and pericardial or epicardial biopsies are essential for the confirmation of
malignant pericardial disease. [188][ –][ 191]

The diagnostic yield of the concentrations of tumour markers in
pericardial fluid remains controversial: carcinoembryonic antigen
(CEA), CYFRA 21–1, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), CA-19–9,
CA- 72–4, SCC, GATA3 and VEGF may be useful, but none of these
tumour markers has been proven to be accurate enough for distinguishing malignant from benign effusions. [192][,][193] Epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) mutation should be evaluated and has
prognostic indications in patients with malignant pericardial effusion
in the course of lung adenocarcinoma [194] in order to tailor the

treatment.

Treatment of cardiac tamponade is a class I indication for pericardiocentesis. The following steps are recommended in large
suspected neoplastic pericardial effusion without tamponade:
(i) systemic antineoplastic treatment as baseline therapy, [189] (ii)
pericardiocentesis to relieve symptoms and establish a diagnosis
and (iii) intrapericardial instillation of cytostatic/sclerosing agents
to prevent recurrences. Pericardial drainage is recommended in
all patients with large effusions because of the high recurrence
rate (40–70%). [193][ –][ 196] Prevention of recurrences may be achieved
by intrapericardial instillation of sclerosing and cytotoxic
agents. [197][ –][ 204] Intrapericardial treatment should be tailored to
the type of tumour: cisplatin was most effective in pericardial involvement in the course of lung cancer [200][,][204] and thiotepa was
more effective in breast cancer pericardial metastases. [197][,][198] Tetracyclines as sclerosing agents also control malignant pericardial
effusion in ≏85% of cases, but side effects and complications are
quite frequent: fever (19%), chest pain (20%) and atrial arrhythmias
(10%). [189][,][199] Radiation therapy is very effective (93%) in controlling malignant pericardial effusion in patients with radiosensitive
tumours such as lymphomas and leukaemias. However, radiotherapy of the heart can cause myocarditis and pericarditis. [189] Pericardiotomy is indicated when pericardiocentesis cannot be
performed. [205] The procedure can be carried out under local anaesthesia, but complications include myocardial laceration,
pneumothorax and mortality. [189][,][205] Surgical pericardiotomy
does not improve clinical outcomes over pericardiocentesis
and is associated with a higher rate of complications. [202] Pleuropericardiotomy allows drainage of malignant pericardial fluid
into the pleural space. It is associated with a higher complication
rate and offers no advantage over pericardiocentesis or pericardiotomy. Pericardiectomy is rarely indicated, mainly for pericardial
constriction or complications of previous procedures. [189] Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy creates a pleuropericardial direct
communication, which allows fluid drainage into the pleural
space: in large malignant pericardial effusions and recurrent
tamponade it seems to be effective (90–97%) and safe. [204] Pericardial window creation via left minithoracotomy is a safe and effective approach in the surgical treatment of malignant cardiac

tamponade. [205] In clinical practice, management is often palliative at
late stages with advanced disease; it is aimed only at the relief of
symptoms rather than treatment of the underlying disease, taking
into account prognosis and the overall quality of life of the
patients. [206]

5.8 Other forms of pericardial disease
5.8.1 Radiation pericarditis
Prior chest radiation is an important cause of pericardial disease. Most
cases are secondary to radiation therapy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma or
breast or lung cancer. Serious radiation-induced pericardial disease
was most often due to radiation therapy of Hodgkin’s lymphoma, although the incidence of the condition has decreased with lower
doses and modern radiation therapy techniques (shielding and dose
calculation). As an example, the incidence of pericarditis decreased
from 20 to 2.5%. [208] Less commonly, radiation exposure can cause
other conditions (e.g. oesophageal cancer) or can occur in association
with nuclear accidents. Soon after radiation the patient may develop
acute pericarditis with or without effusion. [208] Late onset of pericardial disease is common; it has been observed in up to 20% of patients
within 2 years following irradiation, [209] with a latency of up to 15–20
years, and is not necessarily preceded by acute pericarditis. [210] Late
pericardial disease may consist of effusive-constrictive pericarditis
or classical constrictive pericarditis (4–20% of patients) and appears
to be dose dependent and related to the presence of pericardial effusion in the delayed acute phase. [209] Alternatively, radiation damage
may result in a large pericardial effusion, with or without tamponade.
The effusion may be serous or haemorrhagic and has a high probability of developing fibrous adhesions. Therapies are similar to those employed in pericarditis and pericardial effusion. Therapeutic radiation
may cause other types of cardiac injury as well. The most serious is
radiation-induced cardiomyopathy, but the coronary arteries and
the cardiac valves may also be affected; this probably explains why
pericardiectomy for radiation-induced disease is associated with a
worse outcome than when performed for constrictive pericarditis resulting from most other causes.

5.8.2 Chylopericardium
Chylopericardium is a pericardial effusion composed of chyle,
the normal content of the lymphatic vessels. It is a rare disorder
that may be primary or, more often, secondary to injury to the
thoracic duct, which carries chyle from the intestinal tract to the
blood at the junction of the left internal jugular and left subclavian
veins. [211] It is often associated with chylothorax. Cardiac complications are cardiac tamponade, acute pericarditis and chronic constriction. Causes are trauma, surgery (especially for congenital
heart disease), congenital lymphangiomatosis, radiotherapy, subclavian vein thrombosis, infection (e.g. TB), mediastinal neoplasms
and acute pancreatitis. [212][ –][ 214] Primary chylopericardium is less
common and is a diagnosis by exclusion. CT with and without contrast enhancement or combined with lymphangiography/lymphangioscintigraphy (rarely performed) can be used to identify injury
or blockage of the thoracic duct.
Chylopericardium should not be confused with cholesterol
pericarditis, in which the fluid is clear and occurs in tuberculous
pericarditis, rheumatoid pericarditis and trauma. The concentration of cholesterol equals or exceeds that of the blood.
Pericardiocentesis is seldom effective and optimal therapy
is radical pericardiectomy plus treatment of the underlying
cause. [215][,][216]


5.8.3 Drug-related pericarditis and pericardial effusion
Pericardial reactions to drugs are rare (Table 1). Pericardial damage
has also been associated with polymer fume inhalation, ‘serum sickness’ by blood products or foreign antisera, venoms (scorpion fish
sting), foreign substance reactions by direct pericardial application
(e.g. talc, magnesium silicate), silicones, tetracyclines, sclerosants, asbestos and iron in b-thalassaemia. [1] Management is based on discontinuation of the causative agent and symptomatic treatment.
The use of heparin and anticoagulant therapies is often perceived
as a possible risk factor for the development of a worsening or
haemorrhagic pericardial effusion that may result in cardiac tamponade, but a multivariable analysis of nearly 500 consecutive cases of
acute pericarditis did not show this to be the case. [9] Similarly in another study of 274 patients with acute pericarditis or myopericarditis, the use of heparin or other anticoagulants was not associated
with an increased risk of cardiac tamponade. [7] On the other hand,
in the setting of iatrogenic pericardial effusion, full anticoagulation
may be a risk factor for tamponade and complications. [217]

5.8.4 Pericardial effusion in metabolic and endocrine

disorders

The main cause of pericardial diseases in this setting is represented
by hypothyroidism. Pericardial effusion may occur in ≏5–30% of
patients with hypothyroidism, but recent data are lacking; [218][,][219] it
may be quite large, but tamponade occurs rarely. It is diagnosed
by a high thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level, and clinically is
characterized by relative bradycardia and low QRS voltage in the

ECG.

5.8.5 Pericardial involvement in pulmonary arterial
hypertension
Pericardial effusion in the setting of pulmonary artery hypertension
(PAH) is common (25–30%) and typically small in size, but rarely
causes haemodynamic compromise. Pericardial effusion development in PAH appears to relate to right ventricular failure and a subsequent increase in right-sided filling pressures along with right atrial
hypertension and increased pressure in the thebesian veins and coronary sinus. These processes result in increased filtration and
lymphatic obstruction, resulting in pericardial effusion. [220]

Diagnosis of cardiac tamponade in a patient with severe PAH is
challenging. Determining the haemodynamic significance of pericardial effusions in PAH requires increased attention since high rightsided pressures can mask many of the typical right-sided clinical
and echocardiographic findings of tamponade. Because there is elevation in right-sided intracardiac chamber pressures, right-sided
chamber collapse is uncommon. In contrast, left atrial pressure is

typically lower in PAH and therefore left atrial early diastolic collapse is more commonly seen. Exaggerated ventricular interdependence, such as a decrease in left ventricular filling with early
inspiration, may also be present.
The presence of pericardial effusion has been associated with

connective tissue disease, shorter 6-minute walk distance and an

elevated B-type natriuretic peptide level. Even a small quantity of excess pericardial fluid in a patient with PAH portends a poor prognosis. Pericardial effusions in PAH appear to be a marker of
co-morbidity with either concomitant connective tissue disease
or high venous pressure; these two factors are recognized to confer
an adverse risk. [220]

5.8.6 Pericardial cysts
Pericardial cysts are rare mediastinal masses with an incidence of 1 in
100,000 patients [131][,][221] that have been described as diverticulae or
cystic formations when an abnormal chest X-ray was obtained.
They represent 6% of mediastinal masses and 33% of mediastinal
cysts. Other cysts in the mediastinum are bronchogenic (34%), enteric (12%), thymic and others (21%). [131][,][221] They are often found in
either one of the cardiophrenic angles. [131][,][206][,][221] Cysts do not communicate with the pericardial space, whereas diverticulae do. They
may be uni- or multiloculated. Inflammatory cysts comprise pseudocyst as well as encapsulated or loculated pericardial effusions caused
by rheumatic disorders, bacterial infection, trauma or cardiac surgery. Echinococcal cysts usually originate from ruptured hydatid
cysts in the liver and the lungs. The differential diagnosis comprises
loculated pericardial effusions of unknown origin and malignant
pericardial masses. The diagnostic workup includes echocardiography, CT and eventually CMR to define the size, density and neighbouring structures. [131][,][221] They are mostly asymptomatic and
detected incidentally, but can also present with chest discomfort,
dyspnoea or palpitations due to cardiac compression. The first
treatment for symptomatic congenital and inflammatory cysts is
percutaneous aspiration, [206][,][222] possibly associated with ethanol
sclerosis. [222] If the diagnosis is not completely established by imaging
or the cyst recurs after drainage, surgical resection may be necessary. For echinococcal cysts, percutaneous aspiration and instillation
of ethanol or silver nitrate after pre-treatment with albendazole
(800 mg/day for 4 weeks) has been proposed. [1]
### 6. Age and gender issues in pericardial diseases

6.1 Paediatric setting

Pericarditis accounts for ≏5% of all children who present with chest
pain to a paediatric emergency department. [223] Children may be affected by the same syndromes that affect adults. [17] Diagnostic criteria are the same and the risk of recurrence is similar (15–30%).
The aetiology is similar to that in adults, with PPS more often described, particularly after interatrial defect correction. [18] Compared
with adults, children often have a marked inflammatory clinical pattern, with more commonly fever, pleuropulmonary involvement
and raised CRP and less commonly anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)
positivity. This might imply activation of inflammatory pathways
with release of IL-1. [19]


No RCT has been done in children. NSAIDs remain the main
stay, at high dosages (Web Table 7). Most paediatricians avoid aspirin in children. Colchicine halved recurrences in children. [19]

Corticosteroid use should be restricted in children even more

than in adults, given that their side effects (striae rubre and
growth impairment) are particularly deleterious in growing
children; the minimal effective dose should be sought. Severe physical restriction is bothersome in children and may further worsen
their quality of life and that of their family. Anakinra (anti-IL-1
receptor) is a new option for children, especially if they are
corticosteroid-dependent. [20][ –][ 23]

The long-term prognosis in children is good; however, quality of
life can be severely affected with repeated recurrences, glucocorticoid dependence and severe physical restriction. [19]

|Recommendations|Classa|Levelb|Ref.c|
|---|---|---|---|
|NSAIDs at high doses are recommended<br>as first-line therapy for acute pericarditis<br>in children until complete symptom<br>resolution (see Web Table 9 for dosages)|I|C||

6.2 Pregnancy, lactation and reproductive
issues

The most common form of pericardial involvement in pregnancy is
hydropericardium, usually as a benign mild effusion by the third trimester, which is found in up to 40% of women, often occasionally.
The effusion is usually silent and clinical examination and ECG are
generally normal. In a few cases, slightly elevated blood pressure
and/or aspecific ST-T changes have been documented. [24][,][25] The
most common disease to require medical therapy is acute pericarditis; diagnosis is made using the usual criteria. No specific aetiology







2956 ESC Guidelines


is usually identified. Nowadays the general outcomes of pregnancies
in these women when followed by dedicated multidisciplinary teams
are similar to those expected in the general population. [25]

A proposed treatment scheme for pericarditis during pregnancy
is described in Web Table 8. [25][ –] [27] Pregnancy in women with recurrent pericarditis should be planned during a phase of disease quiescence. [25][ –][ 27] Classic NSAIDs (ibuprofen, indomethacin) may be
considered during the first and second trimesters; [25][ –][ 27] most experts prefer high-dose aspirin, since it is regularly used in antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnancy and is moderately effective
in the prevention of pre-eclampsia in high-risk obstetric patients. [224][,][225] After gestational week 20, all NSAIDs (except aspirin
≤100 mg/day) can cause constriction of the ductus arteriosus and
impair foetal renal function, and they should be withdrawn in any
case at gestational week 32. [224][,][225] The lowest effective doses of
prednisone may be used throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding
(with supplementation with calcium and vitamin D). [25] [–] [27] Paracetamol is allowed throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding, as are
anti-histamine H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors. [226] During
pregnancy, tapering of therapies should be extremely cautious. Normal vaginal delivery is possible and should be considered in the
absence of contraindications. [25][ –][ 27] Ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen and prednisone may be considered in women who are breastfeeding. After discontinuation of breastfeeding, gradual tapering of
prednisone should be considered, eventually resuming colchicine.
Colchicine is considered contraindicated during pregnancy and
breastfeeding, even though no adverse events during pregnancy and
foetal or child development have been reported in women with FMF
treated with colchicine during pregnancy and breastfeeding. [227] [–] [229]

6.3 The elderly

Most guidelines have not discussed the applicability of their recommendations to older patients with multiple co-morbidities. [230] No
paper has specifically addressed pericardial diseases in the elderly,
so only expert opinion exists. Therapy adherence and compliance
may be problematic in the elderly because of cognitive impairment,
poor vision or hearing and cost, but the strongest predictor of nonadherence is the number of medications. [230] Indomethacin is not in
dicated, the colchicine dose should be halved and particular care
should be taken to evaluate renal impairment and drug interactions.
### 7. Interventional techniques and surgery

The aetiology of pericardial diseases remains unresolved in many
cases because the full spectrum of diagnostic methods is not used
in many institutions. The gold standard remains surgical by the subxiphoid approach, allowing collection of fluid samples and performing pericardial biopsy and pericardial drainage. Interventional
techniques [206] include the combined use of imaging by pericardioscopy first described in combination with diagnostic molecular,
histological and immunohistological methods to assess the aetiology
and pathogenesis of pericardial and epicardial disease manifestations [133] and the option to intervene therapeutically by instillation
of drugs into the pericardial sac. [63][,][204]


7.1 Pericardiocentesis and pericardial
drainage

For pericardial drainage and biopsy, the surgical approach remains
the gold standard. The classical approach is by subxiphoid incision,
through which it is easy to take fluid samples and perform a pericardial biopsy. The operation is completed by leaving a small drain in
place to evacuate remaining effusion. This technique using a subxiphoid approach is straightforward for a thoracic or cardiovascular
surgeon, if such a team is close to the cardiology team. In clinical
practice, pericardial fluid is aspirated by pericardiocentesis.
State-of-the-art pericardiocentesis must be guided either by
fluoroscopy or echocardiography [206] under local anaesthesia. Blind
procedures must be not be used to avoid the risk of laceration of
the heart or other organs, except in very rare situations that are immediately life threatening. An experienced operator and staff should
perform pericardiocentesis in a facility equipped for radiographic,
echocardiographic, haemodynamic and ECG monitoring.
For echo-guided pericardiocentesis, the ideal entry site is the
point on the body surface where the effusion is closest to the transducer and the fluid collection is maximal. The needle trajectory is
defined by the angulation of the handheld transducer and should
avoid vital structures such as the liver, myocardium, lung, internal
mammary artery (3–5 cm away from the parasternal border) and
the vascular bundle at the inferior margin of each rib. The intended
point of entry is marked on the skin and the direction of the ultrasound beam is carefully noted (see Web supplemental material). An
additional technique is the echo-guided approach followed by echomonitoring of the procedure.
For fluoroscopic-guided pericardiocentesis, a polytef-sheathed
needle with an attached saline-filled syringe is advanced under moderate suction until the pericardial sac is reached. [206] When using the
more common subxiphoid route for pericardiocentesis, a Tuohy-17,
blunt-tip introducer needle is advanced to the left shoulder at a
30-degree angle to the skin, thus avoiding coronary, pericardial and
internal mammary arteries. The lateral angiographic view provides
the best visualization of the puncturing needle and its relation to
the diaphragm and pericardium. The needle is slowly advanced towards the heart shadow and the epicardial halo phenomenon, under
moderate suction and with injection of small amounts of diluted contrast medium, until pericardial fluid is aspirated. If haemorrhagic fluid
is freely aspirated, a few millilitres of contrast medium may be injected
under fluoroscopic control to verify the position of the needle. A soft
J-tip guidewire is then introduced and after dilatation is exchanged for
a multihole pigtail catheter, through which the fluid is evacuated under the control of intrapericardial pressure. [206]

Pericardiocentesis should be performed by experienced operators and carries a risk of complications ranging from 4 to 10% depending on the type of monitoring, the skill of the operator and
the setting (emergency vs. urgent vs. elective). [183][,][206] Most common
complications include arrhythmias, coronary artery or cardiac
chamber puncture, haemothorax, pneumothorax, pneumopericardium and hepatic injury (Web Table 9).
Pericardiocentesis may have additional limitations/dangers when
pericardial fluid is not free and when located in a lateral or posterior
position or,10 mm. In these cases a surgical approach might be
safer, depending on local expertise and availability.

ESC Guidelines 2957


7.2 Pericardioscopy

Pericardioscopy permits visualization of the pericardial sac with its
epicardial and pericardial layers. Macroscopic views show a clustering of protrusions, haemorrhagic areas and neovascularization in
malignant pericardial effusion, which are often haemorrhagic, in contrast to radiogenic or viral and autoimmune effusions. [133][,][206]

Pericardioscopy enables the performing physician to take targeted
biopsy specimens from epicardial and pericardial layers, avoiding epicardial vessels and increasing the probability of obtaining diseasespecific results. For safety reasons it is important to have a second
wire in place. The safety wire allows a quick exchange with a pigtail
catheter and allows autotransfusion in the case of relevant bleeding.
By selecting the biopsy site, less informative white areas of fibrin can
be avoided and dark spots of inflammation, malignancy or haemorrhagic imbibitions can be selected, which can be identified best in
the blue-light mode. Pericardial biopsy can even be taken under
radiologic control alone. The open jaws of the bioptome are advanced gently until the silhouette of the pericardial sac is reached.
Then the jaws are closed and the biopsy sample is taken. Seven to
10 samples should be taken to reduce sampling error. The most
meaningful diagnostic yield from pericardial biopsies can be obtained
by multiple pericardioscopically guided tissue acquisitions.
This technique is quite demanding and can be performed in only a
limited number of experienced tertiary referral centres. Pericardioscopy may be considered as a diagnostic method for inspection of
the pericardium and epicardium in experienced centres. It permits
safe tissue acquisition in pericardial diseases of unknown origin.

7.3 Pericardial fluid analysis, pericardial
and epicardial biopsy

Serosanguinous or haemorrhagic fluid can be found in malignant as
well as post-pericardiotomy, rheumatologic and traumatic effusions
or can be caused by iatrogenic lesions during pericardiocentesis, but
also in idiopathic and viral forms. In cases of sepsis, TB or in HIVpositive patients, bacterial cultures can be diagnostic. Fluid cytology
can separate malignant from non-malignant effusions, which is important for effusions in tumour patients after radiotherapy of the
mediastinum. Discriminative signatures between malignant and
autoreactive effusions are higher levels of tumour markers in neoplastic pericardial effusion. [133][,][206]

Cytology and assessment of bacterial cultures of the fluid, histological/immunohistological evaluation of biopsy specimens and molecular analysis (PCR for microbial agents of fluid and tissue) allow a
definite aetiological diagnosis in many cases, which permits further
treatment. [133]

7.4 Intrapericardial treatment

In patients with a larger effusion of unknown origin, prolonged pericardial drainage may allow subsequent intrapericardial treatment.
In neoplastic pericardial effusion, most frequently due to bronchus carcinoma or breast cancer, intrapericardial cisplatin or thiotepa therapy have been proposed in combination with systemic
antineoplastic treatment, which should be tailored in collaboration
with the oncologist. [204]

In autoreactive and lymphocytic pericardial effusion diseasespecific intrapericardial crystalloid triamcinolone (300 mg/m [2]


body surface) may be considered. [64] Viral pericarditis may be excluded by PCR in fluid and tissue specimens, but such investigations
are not usually performed in uncomplicated cases in clinical practice.
In cases of uraemic pericardial effusion, intrapericardial therapy
with triamcinolone may be considered, apart from intensified
haemo- or peritoneal dialysis and fluid evacuation. [64][,][65]

In rare cases of recurrent effusion, balloon pericardiotomy is an
option that allows a (transient) pericardio(-pleural-)abdominal window for drainage. This approach should be avoided in neoplastic or
purulent effusions.

7.5 Pericardial access for
electrophysiology

First reported in 1996, [231] pericardial access has been used for the
mapping and ablation of epicardial substrates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias with improved success rates and avoidance of a surgical
procedure [232][,][233] (see supplemental Web material and Web Table 9
for complications of the procedure).

7.6 Surgery for pericardial diseases

7.6.1 Pericardial window

A pericardial window is a cardiac surgical procedure to create a
communication, or ‘window’, from the pericardial space to the
pleural cavity. The purpose of the window is to allow a pericardial
effusion (usually malignant) to drain from the space surrounding the
heart into the chest cavity in order to prevent a large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.
The window is usually performed by a cardiac surgeon, but a pericardial window may be created by video-assisted thoracoscopy or
balloon pericardiotomy by a percutaneous intervention. The main
indication is represented by recurrent large effusions or cardiac
tamponade when a more complex operation such pericardiectomy
is a high risk or the life expectancy of the patient is reduced (e.g.
neoplastic pericardial disease) and the intervention is palliative.
The results of a pericardial window are less definitive since the communication may close and recurrent effusions, especially loculated,
are common and may require additional interventions compared
with pericardiectomy, which is a more complex but complete
operation. [105]

7.6.2 Pericardiectomy
In constrictive pericarditis the treatment is pericardectomy. The
decortications should remove as much of the pericardium as possible with all constricting parietal and epicardial layers, [103] [–][ 105] but
taking care of perserving the phrenic nerves bilaterally. Only by
using sternotomy can all the constricting pericardial layers be
removed. Therefore, left anterolateral thoracotomy should be
avoided since it permits only a partial resection.
It is also necessary to liberate all of the right atrium, the superior
vena cava and especially the inferior vena cava and the inferior part
of the right ventricle adjacent to the diaphragm as far as possible. [103][ –][ 105] Only when the constricting peel is adherent and
calcified is it necessary to leave behind a few islands of the pericardium. To avoid bleeding, cardiopulmonary bypass should be
employed only in cases of co-existent cardiac surgical lesions, but
cardiopulmonary bypass may be needed in stand-by, in case of the
occurrence of haemorrhagic lesions during the procedure. By

2958 ESC Guidelines


applying these principles, the controversy over the type of operation (complete or radical or only anterior pericardiectomy) is
not an issue. In recurrent constrictive pericarditis, a repeated operation has to be done as soon as possible, ideally during the first postoperative year. Rare patients with relapsing pericarditis can also
benefit from pericardiectomy. [33]
### 8. Perspective and unmet needs

Despite a large amount of new data and the first clinical trials
that allow clinical management to be on the road to evidencebased medicine, there are several issues that require additional
research and clarification. The main issues and unsolved questions

include

(1) Pathophysiology and risk factors for recurrent pericarditis.
What is really ‘idiopathic recurrent pericarditis’?
(2) How is it possible to prevent pericarditis beyond colchicine?
(3) Is drug tapering useful for patients with pericarditis?
(4) What is the best treatment duration for patients with pericar
dial diseases?

(5) New and individualized therapies for refractory recurrent
pericarditis. Are they really available and useful?
(6) Is exercise restriction really needed for patients with acute and
recurrent pericarditis?
(7) Given the high risk of constrictive pericarditis in infective pericarditis (i.e. tuberculous and purulent) and the promising effect of intrapericardial fibrinolysis in case reports and small
trials, is intrapericardial fibrinolysis in exudative pericarditis
really safe and efficacious? And when should it be considered
in the clinical management of patients?
(8) What interventions are required to reduce the high mortality
of tuberculous pericarditis treated with antituberculosis

medication?

(9) What actually is pericarditis with myocarditis?
(10) What are the long-term outcomes of patients with myopericarditis and perimyocarditis?
(11) Aetiology and pathophysiology of isolated pericardial effusion.
What is ‘idiopathic pericardial effusion’?
(12) Is diagnosis and treatment necessary for all moderate to large
pericardial effusions?
(13) What are the indications for invasive diagnostic techniques and
their diagnostic yield in clinical practice?
(14) What is the role, value and application of intrapericardial
therapies?
(15) Is pericardiectomy really useful and indicated in refractory recurrent pericarditis?
(16) What are the causes and risk factors for constrictive
pericarditis?
(17) What is the best timing for surgical therapies in pericardial

diseases?

Ongoing basic and clinical research is warranted and needed to address all these issues and provide additional diagnostic and therapeutic tools for individualized management of each patient and to
improve the prognosis.
