### **1. Preamble**

Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of as-­
sisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or therapeutic
approach for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines are in-­
tended for use by health professionals and the European Society of
Cardiology (ESC) makes its Guidelines freely available.

ESC Guidelines do not override the individual responsibility of health
professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consider-­
ation of each patient’s health condition and in consultation with that pa-­
tient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It
is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and

**3630** ESC Guidelines


regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time
of prescription and, where appropriate, to respect the ethical rules of
their profession.

ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given
topic and are regularly updated. ESC Policies and Procedures for for-­
mulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website
[(https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines).](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)

Interim Focused Updates are created when the publication of new
evidence could influence clinical practice before the next full update
of a guideline is published. This Focused Update provides new and re-­
vised recommendations for the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis

and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. View the full 2021 ESC

The members of the Task Force were selected by the ESC to re-­
present professionals involved with the medical care of patients with
this pathology. The Task Force performed a critical evaluation of diag-­
nostic and therapeutic approaches, including assessment of the risk–
benefit ratio. The strength of every new or updated recommendation
and the level of evidence supporting them were weighed and scored ac-­
cording to predefined scales as outlined below. The Task Force followed
ESC voting procedures and all approved recommendations were sub-­
ject to a vote and achieved at least 75% agreement among voting

members.

ESC Guidelines **3631**


The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration
of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or
potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest
were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and
[can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[guidelines) and have been compiled in a report published in a supple-­](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
mentary document with the guidelines. The Task Force received its en-­
tire financial support from the ESC without any involvement from the
healthcare industry.

The ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee supervises
and coordinates the preparation of new Guidelines and Focused
Updates and is responsible for the approval process. ESC Guidelines
and Focused Updates undergo extensive review by the CPG
Committee and external experts, including members from across the
whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty
Communities and National Cardiac Societies. After appropriate revi-­
sions, Guidelines and Focused Updates are signed off by all the experts
involved in the Task Force. Finalized documents are signed off by the
CPG Committee for publication in the *European Heart Journal* . This
Focused Update was developed after careful consideration of the scien-­
tific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of
writing. [Tables of evidence summarizing the findings of studies](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-ookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad195#supplementary-data)
[informing development of the Focused Update are included. The ESC](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-ookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad195#supplementary-data)
warns readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and
declines any responsibility in this respect.

Off-label use of medication may be presented in this Focused Update
if a sufficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically
appropriate for a given condition. However, the final decisions con-­
cerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health
professional giving special consideration to:

- The specific situation of the patient. Unless otherwise provided for
by national regulations, off-label use of medication should be limited
to situations where it is in the patient’s interest with regard to the
quality, safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has
been informed and has provided consent.

- Country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental
drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which health profes-­
sionals are subject, where applicable.
### **2. Introduction**

Since the publication of the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and
treatment of acute and chronic heart failure (HF), [1] there have been sev-­
eral randomized controlled trials that should change patient manage-­
ment ahead of the next scheduled full guidelines. This 2023 Focused
Update addresses changes in recommendations for the treatment of

HF because of this new evidence. New evidence was considered until

31 March 2023. All major randomized controlled clinical trials and
meta-analyses were presented, discussed, and then voted upon for in-­
clusion. Members with declared interests in specific topics were asked
to abstain from voting on those topics. The trials were presented and
discussed in detail before a consensus was reached about any possible
classes of recommendations (COR) ( *Table 1* ) and levels of evidence
(LOE) ( *Table 2* ) to be assigned.

The Task Force considered and discussed the following new trials
and any meta-analyses including them: ADVOR (Acetazolamide in
Decompensated Heart Failure with Volume Overload), [2] CLOROTIC
(Combination of Loop Diuretics with Hydrochlorothiazide in Acute
Heart Failure), [3] COACH (Comparison of Outcomes and Access to


Care for Heart Failure), [4] DAPA-CKD (Dapagliflozin And Prevention
of Adverse outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease), [5] DELIVER
(Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the LIVEs of Patients with
PReserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure), [6] EMPA-KIDNEY
(EMPAgliflozin once daily to assess cardio-renal outcomes in patients
with chronic KIDNEY disease), [7] EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin
Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved
Ejection Fraction), [8] EMPULSE (Empagliflozin in Patients Hospitalized
with Acute Heart Failure Who Have Been Stabilized), [9]

FIDELIO-DKD (Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease
Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease), [10] FIGARO-DKD
(Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in
Diabetic Kidney Disease), [11] IRONMAN (Effectiveness of Intravenous

Iron Treatment versus Standard Care in Patients with Heart Failure
and Iron Deficiency), [12] PIVOTAL (Proactive IV Iron Therapy
in Haemodialysis Patients), [13][,][14] REVIVED-BCIS2 (Revascularization
for Ischemic Ventricular Dysfunction), [15] STRONG-HF (Safety,
Tolerability and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by
NT-proBNP Testing, of Heart Failure Therapies), [16]

TRANSFORM-HF (Torsemide Comparison with Furosemide for
Management of Heart Failure), [17] and TRILUMINATE Pivotal (Clinical

Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients Treated With
the Tricuspid Valve Repair System Pivotal). [18]

Only results that would lead to new or changed class I/IIa recommen-­
dations were selected for inclusion in Recommendation Tables. Trials

that would have an impact upon recommendations in other ESC
Guidelines under preparation have not been included to avoid discord-­
ance. This is the case for REVIVED-BCIS2, which will be considered in

the upcoming chronic coronary syndrome Guidelines.

In addition to selecting the trials to be included, the Task Force also
discussed changing the description of HF with preserved ejection frac-­
tion (HFpEF) to HF with normal ejection fraction (HFnEF) and the left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) threshold for HFnEF. The Task
Force ultimately decided to keep the term HFpEF and left any further
changes in terminology to be considered in the next ESC HF Guidelines.

In assigning recommendations, as in the 2021 ESC HF Guidelines, the
Task Force focused on the primary endpoints of trials. This means that,
for most HF trials, effective treatments reduce the risk of the time to
first occurrence of the composite of either HF hospitalization *or* cardio-­
vascular (CV) death (the correct convention for describing such a com-­
posite). Of course, that does not mean each component is reduced
individually. For total-event trials, where the primary composite out-­
come included total (first and repeat) HF hospitalizations *and* all CV
deaths, the convention for describing this composite, i.e. *and* not *or*,
was used. Once again that does not mean that both components
were reduced. All the new recommendations are additive to the re-­
commendations of the 2021 ESC HF Guidelines and changed recom-­
mendations substitute those of the 2021 ESC HF Guidelines.

After due deliberation, the Task Force decided to update recom-­
mendations for the following sections of the 2021 ESC HF Guidelines:

- Chronic HF: HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and
HFpEF

- Acute HF

- Comorbidities and prevention of HF.
### **3. Chronic heart failure**

The original 2021 ESC HF Guidelines adopted the classification of
chronic HF according to LVEF ( *Table 3* ).

**3632** ESC Guidelines

Table 3 **Definition of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, mildly reduced ejection fraction, and preserved**
**ejection fraction**

|Type of HF|Col2|HFrEF|HFmrEF|HFpEF|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Criteria|1|Symptoms ± signsa|Symptoms ± signsa|Symptoms ± signsa|
|Criteria|2|LVEF ≤40%|LVEF 41–49%b|LVEF ≥50%|
|Criteria|3|–|–|Objective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnormalities consistent with<br>the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction/raised LV filling pressures, including raised<br>natriuretic peptidesc|



HF, heart failure; HFmrEF, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; LV, left
ventricle; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction.
a Signs may not be present in the early stages of HF (especially in HFpEF) and in optimally treated patients.
b For the diagnosis of HFmrEF, the presence of other evidence of structural heart disease (e.g. increased left atrial size, LV hypertrophy, or echocardiographic measures of impaired LV filling)
makes the diagnosis more likely.
c For the diagnosis of HFpEF, the greater the number of abnormalities present, the higher the likelihood of HFpEF.


For those with HFmrEF, with LVEF between 41% and 49%, the Task
Force made weak recommendations (COR IIb, LOE C) in the 2021 ESC
HF Guidelines for the use of disease-modifying therapies that have class I
evidence for use in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). These
were based on subgroup analyses of trials that were not specifically de-­
signed to focus on HFmrEF, including trials where the overall endpoints
were statistically neutral. The Task Force made no recommendations
for the use of sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. [1]

For those with HFpEF, the Task Force made no recommendations
for the use of disease-modifying HFrEF therapies as clinical trials with
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin recep-­
tor blockers (ARB), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA),
and angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) failed to meet
their primary endpoints. There were no published trials with SGLT2 in-­
hibitors to consider at the time. [1]

Since then, two trials have become available with the SGLT2 inhibi-­
tors empagliflozin and dapagliflozin, in patients with HF and LVEF
>40%, that justify an update in the recommendations for both
HFmrEF and HFpEF. [6][,][8]

The first trial to report was the EMPEROR-Preserved trial. [8] It re-­
cruited 5988 patients with HF (New York Heart Association [NYHA]
class II–IV) whose LVEF was >40% and who had raised plasma concen-­
trations of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)
(>300 pg/mL for those in sinus rhythm or >900 pg/mL for those in at-­
rial fibrillation). They were randomized to empagliflozin (10 mg once
daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of CV death
or hospitalization for HF. At a median follow-up of 26.2 months, empa-­
gliflozin reduced the primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.69–0.90; *P* < .001). The effect was mainly dri-­
ven by a reduction in HF hospitalizations with empagliflozin and there
was no reduction in CV death. The effects were seen in patients with
and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). [8] The majority of patients
were on an ACE-I/ARB/ARNI (80%) and beta-blocker (86%) and 37%
were on an MRA. [19]

A year later, the DELIVER trial reported on the effects of dapagliflo-­
zin (10 mg once daily) compared with placebo in 6263 patients with HF
(NYHA class II–IV). [6] Patients had to have an LVEF >40% at the time of
recruitment, but those who previously had an LVEF ≤40% that had im-­
proved to >40% were also enrolled. Outpatients and inpatients hospi-­
talized for HF were eligible. An elevated concentrations of natriuretic


peptides were also a mandatory inclusion criterion (≥300 pg/mL in
sinus rhythm or ≥600 pg/mL in atrial fibrillation). [6][,][20][,][21]

Dapagliflozin reduced the primary endpoint of CV death or worsen-­
ing HF (HF hospitalization or urgent HF visit) (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73–
0.92; *P* < .001). Once again, the principal effect was due to a reduction
in worsening HF and there was no reduction in CV death. Dapagliflozin
also improved symptom burden. The effects were independent of
T2DM status. [6] The efficacy of dapagliflozin was consistent in those
who remained symptomatic, despite improved LVEF, suggesting that
these patients may also benefit from SGLT2 inhibition. [6][,][22] The benefit
of dapagliflozin was also consistent across the range of LVEF studied. [6][,][23]

The background use of therapies for concomitant CV disease was high:
77% were on a loop diuretic, 77% were on an ACE-I/ARB/ARNI, 83%
were on a beta-blocker, and 43% were on an MRA. [6]

A subsequent aggregate data meta-analysis of the two trials con-­
firmed a 20% reduction in the composite endpoint of CV death or first
hospitalization for HF (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73–0.87; *P* < .001). CV death
was not reduced significantly (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–1.00; *P* = .052). HF
hospitalization was reduced by 26% (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67–0.83;
*P* < .001). There were consistent reductions in the primary endpoint
across the LVEF range studied. [24] Another individual patient data
meta-analysis that incorporated data from DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin
And Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Heart Failure) in HFrEF with
DELIVER confirmed that there was no evidence that the effect of
dapagliflozin differed by ejection fraction. [22] This also showed that dapa-­
gliflozin reduced the risk of death from CV causes (HR 0.86, 95% CI
0.76–0.97; *P* = .01). [22]

The Task Force discussed the results of these trials in depth, focusing
particularly on the fact that they both met their primary endpoints, but
they did so by a reduction in HF hospitalizations and not CV death. The
Task Force decided to make recommendations on the primary end-­
points. That is consistent with all the recommendations made in the
2021 ESC HF Guidelines. The Task Force did not specify
NT-proBNP thresholds for treatment, consistent with recommenda-­
tions for other therapies in the original 2021 ESC HF Guidelines.
However, it should be noted that, in the diagnostic algorithm for HF
in the 2021 ESC HF Guidelines, raised concentrations of natriuretic

peptides are usually implicit to that diagnosis. Taking these two trials
into account, the following recommendations have been made for
HFmrEF and HFpEF (see *Figs 1 and 2*, respectively).

**3634** ESC Guidelines

### **4. Acute heart failure**

Treatment of acute HF was outlined in the recent 2021 ESC HF

Guidelines and a Heart Failure Association scientific statement on
HF. [1][,][25] Since these publications, trials have been conducted with diure-­
tics, as well as on management strategies for patients with acute HF.

The results are summarized here.

**4.1. Medical therapy**

**4.1.1. Diuretics**

ADVOR was a multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 519 patients with acute decom-­
pensated HF, clinical signs of volume overload (i.e. oedema, pleural
effusion, or ascites), and an NT-proBNP level of >1000 pg/mL or a
B-type natriuretic peptide level of >250 pg/mL. They were randomized
to receive intravenous (i.v.) acetazolamide (500 mg once daily) or pla-­
cebo added to standardized i.v. loop diuretic treatment. [2] The primary
endpoint of successful decongestion, defined as the absence of signs
of volume overload, within 3 days after randomization and without
an indication for escalation of decongestive therapy, was achieved in
108 of 256 patients (42.2%) in the acetazolamide group and in 79 of
259 patients (30.5%) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1.46, 95%
CI 1.17–1.82; *P* < .001). Rehospitalization for HF or all-cause death oc-­
curred in 76 patients (29.7%) in the acetazolamide group and in 72 pa-­
tients (27.8%) in the placebo group (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.78–1.48).
Length of hospital stay was 1 day shorter with acetazolamide compared
with placebo (8.8 [95% CI 8.0–9.5] vs. 9.9 [95% CI 9.1–10.8] days). No
difference between the acetazolamide and placebo groups was found
for other outcomes and adverse events. [2] Although these results may
support the addition of acetazolamide to a standard diuretic regimen
to aid decongestion, further data on outcomes and safety are needed.

The CLOROTIC trial enrolled 230 patients with acute HF and ran-­
domized them to oral hydrochlorothiazide (25–100 mg daily, depend-­
ing on estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) or placebo, in
addition to i.v. furosemide. [3] The trial had two co-primary endpoints,
change in body weight and change in patient-reported dyspnoea
from baseline to 72 h after randomization. Patients on hydrochlor-­
othiazide had a greater decrease in body weight at 72 h compared
with those on placebo (−2.3 vs. −1.5 kg; adjusted estimated difference
−1.14 kg, 95% CI −1.84 to −0.42 kg; *P* = .002). Changes in patientreported dyspnoea were similar between the two groups. [3] An increase
in serum creatinine occurred more frequently in patients on hydro-­
chlorothiazide (46.5%) compared with those on placebo (17.2%)
( *P* < .001). The rates of HF rehospitalization and all-cause death were
similar between groups, as was length of stay. [3] The lack of an impact
on clinical outcomes precludes any recommendation in the current
guideline update. Further data on outcomes and safety are needed.

**4.1.2. Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors**
EMPULSE tested the efficacy of the early initiation of empagliflozin in pa-­
tients hospitalized for acute HF. [9] The primary endpoint was ‘clinical bene-­
fit’, defined using a hierarchical composite of death from any cause, number
of HF events, and time to first HF event, or a ≥5 point difference in change
from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total
symptom score at 90 days, assessed using the win-ratio method. HF events
were defined as HF hospitalizations, urgent HF visits, and unplanned out-­
patient HF visits. An event was considered HF-related only if worsening
signs and symptoms of HF were present and an intensification of therapy
(defined as an increase in oral or i.v. diuretics, augmentation of a vasoactive


agent, or starting a mechanical or surgical intervention) was performed. [9]

Patients were randomized in hospital when clinically stable, with a median
time from hospital admission to randomization of 3 days, and were treated
for up to 90 days. The primary endpoint was achieved in more patients
treated with empagliflozin compared with placebo (stratified win ratio
1.36, 95% CI 1.09–1.68; *P* = .0054). Efficacy was independent of LVEF
and diabetes status. From a safety perspective, the rate of adverse events
was similar between the two treatment groups. [9]

These results are consistent with those shown for SGLT2 inhibitors

in patients with chronic HF, regardless of LVEF, and also in those re-­
cently hospitalized for HF, once clinically stable. [9][,][26][–][28] Caution is, how-­
ever, needed in patients with T2DM at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis,
particularly those treated with insulin when carbohydrate intake is re-­
duced or dose of insulin changed. [29] SGLT2 inhibitors are not indicated
in patients with type 1 diabetes.

**4.2. Management strategies**
Two large trials have been published since the last guidelines: COACH

and STRONG-HF.

**4.2.1. Admission phase**

The COACH trial was a cross-sectional, stepped-wedge, clusterrandomized trial including 5452 patients (2972 during the control phase
and 2480 during the intervention phase) enrolled at 10 centres in
Ontario, Canada. [4] During the intervention phase, hospital staff used the
Emergency Heart Failure Mortality Risk Grade 30 Day Mortality-ST
Depression (‘EHMRG30-ST’) score to ascertain whether patients had a
low, intermediate, or high risk of death within 7 days or within 30 days.
The study protocol recommended that low-risk patients be discharged
early (in ≤3 days) and be treated with standardized outpatient care up
to 30-day follow-up, whereas it was advised that intermediate- and highrisk patients be admitted to the hospital. Although early discharge oc-­
curred at a similar rate in the intervention and control groups (57% vs.
58%), the trial was successful in showing a 12% reduction in the primary
outcome of all-cause death or CV hospitalization in the interventional arm
compared with the control arm (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78–0.99), consistent
with a favourable effect of post-discharge care. [4] The trial may need fur-­
ther confirmation multinationally before any recommendation on its ap-­
proach can be offered in a guideline.

**4.2.2. Pre-discharge and early post-discharge phases**

The importance of pre-discharge and early post-discharge assessment in
patients admitted to hospital for an episode of acute HF was already
stressed in the original 2021 ESC HF Guidelines. [1] The STRONG-HF trial
recently showed the safety and efficacy of an approach based on starting
and titrating oral medical therapy for HF within 2 days before anticipated
hospital discharge and in follow-up visits occurring early after discharge. [16]

In this trial, 1078 patients hospitalized for acute HF, not already on full
doses of evidence-based HF therapies, who were haemodynamically
stable, with elevated NT-proBNP concentrations at screening
(>2500 pg/mL), and a >10% decrease in concentration between screen-­
ing and randomization, were randomly assigned, before discharge, to
usual care or high-intensity care. Patients in the high-intensity care group
received early and rapid intensification of oral HF treatment with ACE-I
(or ARB) or ARNI, beta-blockers, and MRA. [16]

The goal of the first titration visit, which occurred within 48 h before
hospital discharge, was to reach at least half of the target doses of re-­
commended medications. Titration to full target doses of oral therapies
was attempted within 2 weeks after discharge, with appropriate safety

ESC Guidelines **3635**


monitoring. Follow-up visits, including physical examination and labora-­
tory evaluation, including NT-proBNP measurement, were performed
at 1, 2, 3, and 6 weeks after randomization to assess the safety and tol-­
erability of medical therapy. Patients assigned to high-intensity care
were more likely to receive full doses of oral therapies than those in
the usual care group (renin–angiotensin system inhibitors 55% vs. 2%,
beta-blockers 49% vs. 4%, and MRA 84% vs. 46%). The trial was
stopped early for benefit. The primary outcome of HF readmission
or all-cause death at 180 days occurred in 15.2% of patients in the highintensity care group and in 23.3% of patients in the usual care group (ad-­
justed RR [aRR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.86; *P* = .0021). Readmissions for
HF were reduced (aRR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38–0.81; *P* = .0011), whereas allcause death by day 180 was not (aRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56–1.26; *P* = .42).
Similar rates of serious adverse events (16% vs. 17%) and fatal adverse
events (5% vs. 6%) were reported in each group. [16]

Based upon the results of STRONG-HF, high-intensity care for initi-­
ation and rapid up-titration of oral HF therapies and close follow-up in
the first 6 weeks after discharge for an acute HF hospitalization is re-­
commended to reduce HF readmission or all-cause death. During the
follow-up visits, particular attention should be paid to symptoms and
signs of congestion, blood pressure, heart rate, NT-proBNP values, po-­
tassium concentrations, and eGFR.

STRONG-HF has several limitations. First, the population was care-­
fully selected, based on baseline NT-proBNP concentrations and their
decline during hospitalization. Second, the majority of patients in the
control group received less than half of full optimal doses of ACE-I/
ARB/ARNI and beta-blockers, and, although similar to many real-world
clinical settings, [30][–][33] their relative undertreatment may have favoured
the high-intensity care arm. Third, the trial was initiated prior to current
evidence and recommendations for SGLT2 inhibitors, which were not

mandated in the protocol.

### **5. Comorbidities**

**5.1. Chronic kidney disease and type 2**
**diabetes mellitus**

The 2021 ESC HF Guidelines gave recommendations for the preven-­
tion of HF in patients with diabetes. This update provides new recom-­
mendations for prevention of HF in patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) and T2DM. [5][,][7][,][10][,][11][,][34][,][35]

Previous trials have shown the effects of ARB in preventing HF events
in patients with diabetic nephropathy. [36][,][37] Both the Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the 2022 American

Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes and

KDIGO recommendations indicate treatment with an ACE-I or ARB
for patients with CKD, diabetes, and hypertension or albuminuria. [38][,][39]

**5.1.1. Sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors**
Two randomized controlled trials, which were stopped early for effi-­
cacy, and a meta-analysis were recently published. DAPA-CKD was a
multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial includ-­
ing both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with a urinary
albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥200 mg/g and an eGFR of 25–75 mL/
min/1.73 m [2], who were randomly assigned 1:1 to dapagliflozin 10 mg
once daily or placebo. [5] Overall, 468 of the 4304 patients enrolled
(11%) had a history of HF. During a median follow-up of 2.4 years, a re-­
duction in the primary outcome, a composite of sustained decline in
eGFR of ≥50%, end-stage kidney disease, or kidney-related or CV
death, was reduced by 39% by dapagliflozin compared with placebo
(HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.51–0.72; *P* < .001). Also, the risk of the secondary
outcome of HF hospitalization or CV death was decreased by dapagli-­
flozin compared with placebo (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55–0.92; *P* = .009)
with, however, a relatively small absolute risk reduction (4.6% vs.
6.4% with dapagliflozin vs. placebo). [5]

EMPA-KIDNEY enrolled a broader group of patients with CKD,
compared with DAPA-CKD, including patients with eGFR 20–45 mL/
min/1.73 m [2], even in the absence of albuminuria, or with an eGFR of
45–90 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ] and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio
≥200 mg/g. Patients were randomized 1:1 to empagliflozin 10 mg once
daily or placebo. [7] Overall, 658 of the 6609 patients enrolled (10%) had a
history of HF. During a median follow-up of 2.0 years, a reduction in the
primary composite endpoint of progression of kidney disease or CV death
was observed. [7] The risk of HF hospitalization or death for CV causes was
not reduced significantly (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.67–1.07; *P* = .15). [7]

DAPA-CKD, EMPA-KIDNEY, CREDENCE [39a] (Canagliflozin and Renal
Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation),
and SCORED [39b] (Effect of Sotagliflozin on Cardiovascular and
Renal Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Moderate Renal
Impairment Who Are at Cardiovascular Risk) were included with
HF trials in a recent meta-analysis. [35] The reduction in HF hospitaliza-­
tions and CV death was similar irrespective of a history of diabetes
when both HF and CKD trials were included (HR 0.77, 95% CI
0.73–0.81 in patients with T2DM, and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.72–0.87 in those
without T2DM). However, results were not significant in patients without
diabetes when only CKD trials were included (HR for HF hospitalizations
and CV death of 0.74, 95% CI 0.66–0.82 in patients with T2DM, and HR of
0.95, 95% CI 0.65–1.40 in patients without T2DM). [35] Based on these re-­
sults, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended in patients with CKD and
T2DM, and with the additional characteristics of the participants in these
trials, including an eGFR >20–25 mL/min/1.73 m [2], to reduce the risk of
HF hospitalization or CV death.

**3636** ESC Guidelines


**5.1.2. Finerenone**

The selective, non-steroidal, MRA finerenone was tested in two trials in
patients with diabetic kidney disease. The FIDELIO-DKD trial enrolled
5734 patients with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30–300 mg/g,
an eGFR 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m [2], and diabetic retinopathy, or a urinary
albumin-to-creatinine ratio 300–5000 mg/g and an eGFR 25–75 mL/
min/1.73 m [2] . [10] The primary outcome of the trial, assessed in a
time-to-event analysis, was a composite of kidney failure, a sustained
decrease of ≥40% in the eGFR from baseline over a period of ≥4
weeks, or death from renal causes. Kidney failure was defined as endstage kidney disease or an eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m [2] ; end-stage kidney
disease was defined as the initiation of long-term dialysis (for ≥90 days)
or kidney transplantation. The primary endpoint of the trial was re-­
duced by finerenone compared with placebo by 18% (HR 0.82, 95%
CI 0.73–0.93; *P* = .001), during a median follow-up of 2.6 years. [10]

There was no evidence of a reduction in HF hospitalizations with finer-­
enone vs. placebo (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.68–1.08), although finerenone
was associated with a lower occurrence of the key secondary endpoint,
a composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal
stroke, and hospitalization for HF (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.99; *P*
= .03). [10] Patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II–IV were excluded
from the trial. However, patients with asymptomatic or NYHA class I
HFrEF, or with HFmrEF or HFpEF, could be enrolled, so that 7.7% of
the patients included had a history of HF. The effects of finerenone
on the composite of CV and renal outcomes, including HF hospitaliza-­
tions, were independent of a previous history of HF. [34]

In the more recent FIGARO-DKD trial, the primary outcome, as-­
sessed in a time-to-event analysis, was a composite of death from CV
causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitaliza-­
tion for HF. [11] The trial enrolled adult patients with T2DM and CKD
treated with a renin–angiotensin system inhibitor at the maximum tol-­
erated dose. CKD was defined according to one of two sets of criteria:
persistent, moderately elevated albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-cre-­
atinine ratio 30 to <300 mg/g) and an eGFR 25–90 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ]

(i.e. stage 2 to 4 CKD); or persistent, severely elevated albuminuria
(urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 300–5000 mg/g) and an eGFR
>60 mL/min/1.73 m [2 ] (i.e. stage 1 or 2 CKD). Patients were required
to have a serum potassium level of ≤4.8 mmol/L at the time of screen-­
ing. [11] The trial included 7437 patients randomly assigned to finerenone
or placebo. [11] At a median follow-up of 3.4 years, the rate of the primary
outcome, CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke,
or HF hospitalization, was lower in the treatment arm compared
with placebo (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76–0.98; *P* = .03). The benefit was dri-­
ven by a numerically small, but statistically significant, lower incidence of
HF hospitalization with finerenone vs. placebo (3.2% vs. 4.4%; HR 0.71,
95% CI 0.56–0.90), with no differences in CV death. [11] In both
FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD the occurrence of hyperkalaemia
was higher in the finerenone group compared with the placebo group.
However, the rate of adverse events was similar between the two arms.

A pre-specified individual patient-level, pooled analysis, including
13 026 patients with diabetic kidney disease followed for a median
of 3.0 years from both the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials,
showed a reduction in the composite CV outcome, including CV
death, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and HF hospi-­
talizations, as well as in HF hospitalizations alone with finerenone vs.
placebo (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.95; *P* = .0018; and HR 0.78, 95% CI
0.66–0.92; *P* = .0030, respectively). [40] Thus, finerenone is recom-­
mended for the prevention of HF hospitalization in patients with

CKD and T2DM.

urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 300–5000 mg/g, in FIGARO-DKD. [11]

**5.2. Iron deficiency**
Recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency
were given in the 2021 ESC HF Guidelines: COR I, LOE C for the diag-­
nosis of iron deficiency, COR IIa, LOE A to improve HF symptoms, ex-­
ercise capacity, and quality of life, and COR IIa, LOE B to reduce HF
hospitalizations, for treatment with ferric carboxymaltose. [1]

A new trial, IRONMAN, has now been published. [12] This was a pro-­
spective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial including pa-­
tients with HF, LVEF ≤45%, and transferrin saturation <20% or
serum ferritin <100 μg/L who were randomly allocated 1:1 to i.v. ferric
derisomaltose or usual care. The patients included were mainly ambu-­
latory, although 14% were enrolled during an HF hospitalization and
18% had an HF hospitalization in the previous 6 months. After a median
follow-up of 2.7 years, the rate ratio for the primary endpoint, a com-­
posite of total (first and recurrent) HF hospitalizations and CV death,
was 0.82 (95% CI 0.66–1.02; *P* = .070). Total hospital admissions for
HF were not reduced significantly with ferric derisomaltose vs. usual
care (16.7 vs. 20.9 per 100 patient-years; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.03;
*P* = .085). As in AFFIRM-AHF (A Randomized Double-blind Placebo
Controlled Trial Comparing the Effects of Intravenous Ferric
Carboxymaltose on Hospitalizations and Mortality in Iron Deficient
Subjects Admitted for Acute Heart Failure), [41] a pre-specified
COVID-19 analysis, censoring follow-up on September 2020, showed
a reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint with ferric derisomal-­
tose vs. control (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58–1.00; *P* = .047). There was a
statistically borderline improvement in the Minnesota Living with
Heart Failure Questionnaire score with ferric derisomaltose (between
treatment difference −3.33, 95% CI −6.67 to 0.00; *P* = .050), but no dif-­
ference in EQ-5D visual analogue scale or EQ-5D index. [12] Some of
these findings in secondary outcomes might be explained by the lack
of adjustment for multiple testing. [42] Safety endpoints, i.e. death and
hospitalization due to infection, did not differ between the two arms. [12]

ESC Guidelines **3637**


These results have been included in meta-analyses of the randomized
controlled trials comparing the effects of i.v. iron therapy with standard
of care or placebo in patients with HF and iron deficiency. [43][–][46] In the ana-­
lysis by Graham *et al* . [44] including 10 trials with 3373 patients, i.v. iron re-­
duced the composite of total HF hospitalizations and CV death (RR
0.75, 95% CI 0.61–0.93; *P* < .01) and first HF hospitalization or CV death
(odds ratio [OR] 0.72, 95% CI 0.53–0.99; *P* = .04). There was no effect on
CV (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70–1.05; *P* = .14) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.93,
95% CI 0.78–1.12; *P* = .47). Similar results were found in the other
meta-analyses. [43][,][45][,][46] In the PIVOTAL trial, a high-dose i.v. iron regimen,
compared with a low-dose regimen, reduced the occurrence of first and
recurrent HF events in patients undergoing dialysis for end-stage CKD. [13][,][14]

Based on trials and recent meta-analyses, [13][,][14][,][41][,][43][,][45][–][49] i.v. iron supple-­
mentation is now recommended in patients with HFrEF or HFmrEF, and
iron deficiency, to improve symptoms and quality of life, and should be
considered to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization. Iron deficiency was
diagnosed by a low transferrin saturation (<20%) or a low serum ferritin
concentration (<100 μg/L). [12][,][41] Notably, in IRONMAN, patients were
excluded if they had haemoglobin >13 g/dL (for women) and >14 g/dL
(for men). [12] The new recommendations are shown below.
