medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their publication. The ESC is not responsible in the event of any contradiction,
discrepancy and/or ambiguity between the ESC Guidelines and any other official recommendations or guidelines issued by the relevant
public health authorities, in particular in relation to good use of healthcare or therapeutic strategies. Health professionals are encouraged
to take the ESC Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in the determination and the
implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies; however, the ESC Guidelines do not override, in any way
whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each
patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient and, where appropriate and/or necessary, the patient’s caregiver. Nor do
the ESC Guidelines exempt health professionals from taking into full and careful consideration the relevant official updated
recommendations or guidelines issued by the competent public health authorities, in order to manage each patient’s case in light of the
scientifically accepted data pursuant to their respective ethical and professional obligations. It is also the health professional’s
responsibility to verify the applicable rules and regulations relating to drugs and medical devices at the time of prescription. The ESC
warns readers that the technical language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in this respect.

###### **1. Preamble**

Guidelines evaluate and summarize available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best diagnostic or thera-­
peutic approach for an individual patient with a given condition.
Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals and the
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) makes its Guidelines freely

available.

ESC Guidelines do not override the individual responsibility of
health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in
consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation
with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/
or necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify
the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and de-­
vices at the time of prescription and to respect the ethical rules of their
profession.

ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given
topic and are regularly updated when warranted by new evidence. ESC
Policies and Procedures for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can
[be found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[Guidelines). This guideline updates and replaces the previous version](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)

from 2020.

The Members of this task force were selected by the ESC to include
professionals involved with the medical care of patients with this path-­
ology as well as patient representatives and methodologists. The selec-­
tion procedure included an open call for authors and aimed to include
members from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant
ESC Subspecialty Communities. Consideration was given to diversity

**3320** ESC Guidelines


and inclusion, notably with respect to gender and country of origin.
The task force performed a critical review and evaluation of the
published literature on diagnostic and therapeutic approaches includ-­
ing assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. The strength of every recom-­
mendation and the level of evidence supporting them were weighed
and scored according to predefined scales as outlined in *Tables 1*
*and* *2* below. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and

Table 1 **Classes of recommendations**


patient-reported experience measures were also evaluated as the ba-­
sis for recommendations and/or discussion in these guidelines. The
task force followed ESC voting procedures and all approved recom-­
mendations were subject to a vote and achieved at least 75% agree-­
ment among voting members. Members of the task force with
declared interests on specific topics were asked to abstain from voting
on related recommendations.










Table 2 **Levels of evidence**



ESC Guidelines **3321**


The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of
interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or po-­
tential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest were
reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules which can be
[found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/guidelines) and have](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
been compiled in a report published in a supplementary document with
the guidelines. Funding for the development of ESC Guidelines is derived
entirely from the ESC with no involvement of the healthcare industry.

The ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee supervises and
co-ordinates the preparation of new guidelines and is responsible for the
approval process. In addition to review by the CPG Committee, ESC
Guidelines undergo multiple rounds of double-blind peer review by exter-­
nal experts, including members from across the whole of the ESC region, all
National Cardiac Societies of the ESC and from relevant ESC Subspecialty
Communities. After appropriate revisions, the guidelines are signed off by
all the experts in the task force. The finalized document is signed off by the
CPG Committee for publication in the *European Heart Journal* .

ESC Guidelines are based on analyses of published evidence, chiefly on
clinical trials and meta-analyses of trials, but potentially including other
types of studies. Evidence tables summarizing key information from rele-­
vant studies are generated early in the guideline development process to
facilitate the formulation of recommendations, to enhance comprehension
of recommendations after publication, and reinforce transparency in the
guidelines development process. The tables are published in their
own section of ESC Guidelines and reference specific recommenda-­
tion tables.

Off-label use of medication may be presented in this guideline if a suf-­
ficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically
appropriate for a given condition. However, the final decisions con-­
cerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health
professional giving special consideration to:

- The specific situation of the patient. Unless otherwise provided for
by national regulations, off-label use of medication should be limited
to situations where it is in the patient’s interest with regard to the
quality, safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has
been informed and has provided consent.

- Country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental
drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which health profes-­
sionals are subject, where applicable.
###### **2. Introduction**

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most commonly encountered heart
conditions, with a broad impact on all health services across primary
and secondary care. The prevalence of AF is expected to double in
the next few decades as a consequence of the ageing population, an in-­
creasing burden of comorbidities, improved awareness, and new tech-­
nologies for detection.

The effects of AF are variable across individual patients; however, mor-­
bidity from AF remains highly concerning. Patients with AF can suffer
from a variety of symptoms and poor quality of life. Stroke and heart
failure as consequences of AF are now well appreciated by healthcare
professionals, but AF is also linked to a range of other thromboembolic
outcomes. These include subclinical cerebral damage (potentially leading
to vascular dementia), and thromboembolism to every other organ, all of
which contribute to the higher risk of mortality associated with AF.


The typical drivers of AF onset and progression are a range of co-­
morbidities and associated risk factors. To achieve optimal care for pa-­
tients with AF, it is now widely accepted that these comorbidities and
risk factors must be managed early and in a dynamic way. Failure to do
so contributes to recurrent cycles of AF, treatment failure, poor patient
outcomes, and a waste of healthcare resources. In this iteration of the

European Society of Cardiology (ESC) practice guidelines on AF, the
task force has consolidated and evolved past approaches to develop
the AF-CARE framework (Atrial Fibrillation—[C] Comorbidity and
risk factor management, [A] Avoid stroke and thromboembolism, [R]
Reduce symptoms by rate and rhythm control, [E] Evaluation and dy-­
namic reassessment). Comorbidities and risk factors is placed as the ini-­
tial and central component of patient management. This should be
considered first as it applies to all patients with AF, regardless of their
thromboembolic risk factors or any symptoms that might warrant
intervention. This is followed by considering how best to [A] avoid
stroke and thromboembolism, and then the options available to reduce
symptoms, and in some cases improve prognosis, through [R] rate and
rhythm control. [E] Evaluation and reassessment should be individua-­
lized for every patient, with a dynamic approach that accounts for
how AF and its associated conditions change over time.

Patient empowerment is critical in any long-term medical problem
to achieve better outcomes, encourage adherence, and to seek timely
guidance on changes in clinical status. A patient-centred, shared
decision-making approach will facilitate the choice of management
that suits each individual patient, particularly in AF where some ther-­
apies and interventions improve clinical outcomes, and others are
focused on addressing symptoms and quality of life. Education and
awareness are essential, not only for patients but also healthcare pro-­
fessionals in order to constrain the impact of AF on patients and

healthcare services.

With this in mind, the task force have created a range of patient
pathways that cover the major aspects of AF-CARE. At present, these re-­
main based on the time-orientated classification of AF (first-diagnosed,
paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent), but ongoing research may allow
for pathology-based classifications and a future of personalized medicine.
Clinical practice guidelines can only cover common scenarios with an evi-­
dence base, and so there remains a need for healthcare professionals to
care for patients within a local multidisciplinary team. While guidelineadherent care has repeatedly been shown to improve patient outcomes,
the actual implementation of guidelines is often poor in many healthcare
settings. This has been demonstrated in the ESC’s first randomized con-­
trolled trial (RCT), STEEER-AF (Stroke prevention and rhythm control
Therapy: Evaluation of an Educational programme of the European
Society of Cardiology in a cluster-Randomised trial in patients with Atrial
Fibrillation), which has sought to improve guideline adherence in parallel
to guideline production. The task force developing the 2024 AF
Guidelines have made implementation a key goal by focusing on the under-­
pinning evidence and using a consistent writing style for each recommen-­
dation (the intervention proposed, the population it should be applied to,
and the potential value to the patient, followed by any exceptions). *Tables 3*
and *4* below outline new recommendations and those with important re-­
visions. These initiatives have been designed to make the *2024 ESC*
*Guidelines for the management of AF* easier to read, follow, and implement,
with the aim of improving the lives of patients with AF. A patient version of
[these guidelines is also available at http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/guidelines-for-patients)

undergoing cardiac surgery.

***Section 6.7*** **—Bleeding risk**


For a formal risk-score-based assessment of bleeding

risk, the HAS-BLED score should be considered to help

address modifiable bleeding risk factors, and to identify

patients at high risk of bleeding (HAS-BLED score ≥3)

for early and more frequent clinical review and

follow-up.

###### **3. Definitions and clinical impact**

**3.1. Definition and classification of AF**
Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common heart rhythm disorders.
A supraventricular arrhythmia with uncoordinated atrial activation,
AF results in a loss of effective atrial contraction (see
[Supplementary data online for pathophysiology). AF is reflected on](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) by the absence of discernible
and regular P waves, and irregular activation of the ventricles. This re-­
sults in no specific pattern to RR intervals, in the absence of an atrio-­
ventricular block. The definition of AF by temporal pattern is
presented in *Table 5* . It should be noted that these categories reflect
observed episodes of AF and do not suggest the underlying patho-­
physiological process. Some patients may progress consecutively
through these categories, while others may need periodic reclassifica-­
tion due to their individual clinical status. Over time, some patients


with AF develop atrial and ventricular damage, which can make at-­
tempts at rhythm control futile. For this reason, or when patients
and physicians make a joint decision for rate control, AF is classified
as permanent (the most common ‘type’ of AF in historical registries). [1]

Despite many limitations, this task force have retained this temporal
approach because most trials in patients with AF have used these de-­
finitions. Classifying AF by underlying drivers could inform manage-­
ment, but the evidence in support of the clinical use of such
classification is currently lacking.

Several other classifications have been applied to patients with AF,
many of which have limited evidence to support them. The definition
of AF is a developing field and ongoing research may allow for
pathology-based strategies that could facilitate personalized manage-­
ment in the future. *Table 6* presents some commonly used concepts
in current clinical practice. Due to the lack of supporting evidence (par-­
ticularly for the time periods stated), this task force have edited and up-­
dated these definitions by consensus.

a Atrial high-rate episodes are defined as episodes generally lasting more than 5 min with an
atrial lead rate ≥170 b.p.m., [7][,][21][–][24] detected by implanted cardiac devices that allow for
automated continuous monitoring and storage of atrial rhythm. Atrial high-rate episodes
need to be visually inspected because some may be electrical artefacts or false positives.

**3.2. Diagnostic criteria for AF**
In many patients, the diagnosis of AF is straightforward, e.g. typical
symptoms associated with characteristic features on a standard
12-lead ECG that indicate the need for AF management. Diagnosis be-­
comes more challenging in the context of asymptomatic episodes or AF
detected on longer-term monitoring devices, particularly those that do

not provide an ECG (see *Section 10* ). To guard against inappropriate
diagnosis of AF, this task force continues to recommend that ECG
documentation is required to initiate risk stratification and AF manage-­
ment. In current practice, ECG confirmation can include multiple op-­
tions: not only where AF persists across a standard 12-lead ECG, but
also single- and multiple-lead devices that provide an ECG (see
[Supplementary data online, Additional Evidence](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Table S1* ). This does
not include non-ECG wearables and other devices that typically use
photoplethysmography. Note that many pivotal AF trials required
two or more ECGs documenting AF, or an established AF diagnosis be-­
fore randomization. [25][–][29] The time period of AF required for diagnosis
on monitoring devices is not clear cut. A standard 12-lead ECG mea-­
sures 10 s, while 30 s or more on single-lead or multiple-lead ECG de-­
vices has generally been the consensus opinion, albeit with limited

evidence.

**3.3. Symptoms attributable to AF**
Symptoms related to episodes of AF are variable and broad, and not
just typical palpitations ( *Figure 1* ). Asymptomatic episodes of AF can
occur, [30] although 90% of patients with AF describe symptoms with
variable severity. [31] Even in symptomatic patients, some episodes of
AF may remain asymptomatic. [32][,][33] The presence or absence of symp-­
toms is not related to incident stroke, systemic embolism, or mortal-­
ity. [34] However, symptoms do impact on patient quality of life. [35][,][36]

Cardiac-specific AF symptoms such as palpitations are less common
than non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, but they significantly
impair quality of life. [36][,][37] Although women are often underrepresented
in clinical trials of AF, [38][–][40] the available literature suggests that
women with AF appear to be more symptomatic and have poorer
quality of life. [41][,][42] Patients with AF report a higher burden of anxiety
and severity of depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.02–1.15; *P* = .009) as compared with the general
population, [43][,][44] with higher prevalence of these symptoms in women
with AF. [45]

Assessment of AF-related symptoms should be recorded initially,
after a change in treatment, or before and after intervention. The
modified European Heart Rhythm Association score (mEHRA)
symptom classification ( *Table 7* ) is similar to the New York
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class for heart failure. It cor-­
relates with quality of life scores in clinical trials, is associated with
clinical progress and events, and may be a valuable starting point
in routine practice to assess the burden and impact of symptoms to-­
gether with the patient. [46][–][48] Note that symptoms may also relate to
associated comorbidities and not just the AF component. The


**3.4. Diagnostic evaluation of new AF**
All patients with AF should be offered a comprehensive diagnostic as-­
sessment and review of medical history to identify risk factors and/or
comorbidities needing active treatment. *Table 8* displays the essential
diagnostic work-up for a patient with AF.

A 12-lead ECG is warranted in all AF patients to confirm rhythm, de-­
termine ventricular rate, and look for signs of structural heart disease,
conduction defects, or ischaemia. [56] Blood tests should be carried out
(kidney function, serum electrolytes, liver function, full blood count, glu-­
cose/glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c], and thyroid tests) to detect any
concomitant conditions that may exacerbate AF or increase the risk
of bleeding and/or thromboembolism. [57][,][58]

Other investigations will depend on individualized assessment and
the planned treatment strategy. [59][–][65] A transthoracic echocardiogram
(TTE) should be carried out in the initial work-up, where this will guide
management decisions, or in patients where there is a change in cardio-­
vascular signs or symptoms. The task force recognizes that accessibility
to TTE might be limited or delayed in the primary care setting, but this
should not delay initiation of oral anticoagulation (OAC) or other com-­
ponents of AF-CARE where indicated. [66] Further details on TTE and re-­
assessment (e.g. if elevated heart rate limits diagnostic imaging, or
where there is a change in clinical status) are presented in *Section 8.3* .
Additional imaging using different modalities may be required to assist
with comorbidity and AF-related management (see [Supplementary](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
[data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Figure S1* ).

**3.5. Adverse events associated with AF**

Atrial fibrillation is associated with a range of serious adverse events
( *Figure 1* ) (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Additional Evidence*
*[Table S2](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). Patients with AF also have high rates of hospitalization
and complications from coexisting medical conditions. The most com-­
mon non-fatal outcome in those with AF is heart failure, occurring in
around half of patients over time. Patients with AF have a four- to fivefold increase in the relative risk (RR) of heart failure compared with
those without AF, as demonstrated in two meta-analyses (RR, 4.62;
95% CI, 3.13–6.83 and RR, 4.99; 95% CI, 3.0–8.22). [68][,][69] The next
most common adverse impacts from AF are ischaemic stroke (RR,
2.3; 95% CI, 1.84–2.94), ischaemic heart disease (RR, 1.61; 95% CI,
1.38–1.87), and other thromboembolic events. [69][–][71] The latter typic-­
ally include arterial thromboembolic events (preferred to the term
systemic), although venous thromboembolism is also associated

with AF. [72][,][73] Patients with AF also have an increased risk of cognitive
impairment (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.25–1.53) [74]

and dementia (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3–2.0). [75][–][77] It should be noted

that most of the observational studies on adverse events have a mix

of patients taking and not taking OAC. When carefully controlling
for the confounding effects of stroke, comorbidities, and OAC, AF ex-­
posure was still significantly associated with vascular dementia (HR,
1.68; 95% CI, 1.33–2.12; *P* < .001), but not Alzheimer’s disease (HR,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.70–1.03; *P* = .09). [78]

Hospital admission rates due to AF vary widely depending on the
population studied, and may be skewed by selection bias. In a Dutch
RCT including first-diagnosed AF patients (mean age 64 years), car-­
diovascular hospitalization rates were 7.0% to 9.4% per year. [79] An
Australian study identified 473 501 hospitalizations for AF during
15 years of follow-up (300 million person-years), with a relative in-­
crease in AF hospitalizations of 203% over the study period, in con-­
trast to an increase for all hospitalizations of 71%. The age-specific
incidence of hospital admission increased particularly in the older
age groups. [80]


Atrial fibrillation is also associated with increased mortality. In
2017, AF contributed to over 250 000 deaths globally, with an
age-standardized mortality rate of 4.0 per 100 000 people (95% un-­
certainty interval 3.9–4.2). [81] The most frequent cause of death in pa-­
tients with AF is heart failure related, [70] with complex relationships to
cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular disease. [82] There is up to a
two-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 1.95; 95% CI,
1.50–2.54), [68] and cardiovascular mortality (RR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.79–
2.30) [69] in AF compared with sinus rhythm. Even in the absence of
major thromboembolic risk factors, the incidence of death is 15.5
per 1000 person-years in those with AF exposure, compared
with 9.4 per 1000 person-years without (adjusted HR, 1.44; 95% CI,
1.38–1.50; *P* < .001). [78] Patients with OAC-related bleeding have
higher mortality, including both minor and major bleeding (as
defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and
Haemostasis scale). [83] Despite OAC, patients with AF remain at high
residual risk of death, highlighting the importance of attention to con-­
comitant disease. [84]

**3.6. Atrial flutter**
Atrial flutter (AFL) is the among the most common atrial tachyarrhyth-­
mias, with an overall incidence rate of 88 per 100 000 person-years, ris-­
ing to 317 per 100 000 person-years in people over 50 years of age. [85]

Risk factors for AFL and AF are similar, and more than half of all patients
with AFL will develop AF. [85] Observational studies suggest that
thromboembolic risk is elevated in AFL. [86] In direct comparison of
AFL with AF, some studies suggest a similar risk of stroke and others
a lower risk in AFL, [87][–][90] possibly due to different comorbidity burdens
and the impact of confounders such as AFL/AF ablation and anticoagu-­
lation (more frequently stopped in AFL). [91]
###### **4. Patient pathways and ** **management of AF**

**4.1. Patient-centred, multidisciplinary AF**
**management**
**4.1.1. The patient at the heart of care**

A patient-centred and integrated approach to AF management means
working with a model of care that respects the patient’s experience,
values, needs, and preferences for planning, co-ordination, and delivery
of care. A central component of this model is the therapeutic relationship
between the patient and the multidisciplinary team of healthcare profes-­
sionals ( *Figure 2* ). In patient-centred AF management, patients are seen
not as passive recipients of health services, but as active participants
who work as partners alongside healthcare professionals. Patientcentred AF management requires integration of all aspects of AF man-­
agement. This includes symptom control, lifestyle recommendations,
psychosocial support, and management of comorbidities, alongside op-­
timal medical treatment consisting of pharmacotherapy, cardioversion,
and interventional or surgical ablation ( *Table 9* ). Services should be de-­
signed to ensure that all patients have access to an organized model of
AF management, including tertiary care specialist services when indi-­
cated (see Supplementary data online, *[Table S1](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)*, *Evidence Table 4 and*
*[Additional Evidence Table S3](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). It is equally important to maintain path-­
ways for patients to promptly re-engage with specialist services when

their condition alters.

**4.1.2. Education and shared decision-making**

Clear advice about the rationale for treatments, the possibility of
treatment modification, and shared decision-making can help patients
[live with AF (see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Table S2* ). [92] An open and
effective relationship between the patient and the healthcare profes-­
sional is critical, with shared decision-making found to improve
outcomes for OAC and arrhythmia management. [93][,][94] In using a
shared approach, both the clinician and patient are involved in the
decision-making process (to the extent that the patient prefers).
Information is shared in both directions. Furthermore, both the

clinician and the patient express their preferences and discuss the
options. Of the potential treatment decisions, no treatment is
also a possibility. [95] There are several toolkits available to facilitate
this, although most are focused on anticoagulation decisions. For ex-­
[ample, the Shared Decision-Making Toolkit (http://afibguide.com,](http://afibguide.com)
[http://afibguide.com/clinician)](http://afibguide.com/clinician) and the Successful Intravenous
Cardioversion for Atrial Fibrillation (SIC-AF) score have been shown
to reduce decisional conflict compared with usual care in patients
with AF. [93][,][94] Patient-support organizations can also make an import-­
ant contribution to providing understandable and actionable knowl-­
edge about AF and its treatments (e.g. local support groups and
[international charities, such as http://afa-international.org). As AF is a](http://afa-international.org)
chronic or recurrent disease in most patients, education is central
to empower patients, their families, and caregivers.

**3332** ESC Guidelines


**4.1.3. Education of healthcare professionals**
Gaps in knowledge and skills across all domains of AF care are consist-­
ently described among cardiologists, neurologists, internal medicine
specialists, emergency physicians, general practitioners, nurses, and al-­
lied health practitioners. [96][–][98] Healthcare professionals involved in
multidisciplinary AF management should have a knowledge of all avail-­
able options for diagnosis and treatment. [99][–][101] In the STEEER-AF
trial, [99] real-world adherence to clinical practice guidelines for AF
across six ESC countries was poor. These findings highlight the critical
need for appropriate training and education of healthcare
professionals. [102]

Specifically targeted education for healthcare professionals can in-­
crease knowledge and lead to more appropriate use of OAC for
prevention of thromboembolism. [103] However, educational interventions
for healthcare providers are often not enough to sustainably impact be-­
haviour. [104] Other tools may be needed, such as active feedback, [103]

clinical decision support tools, [105] expert consultation, [106] or e-Health
learning. [107]

**4.1.4. Inclusive management of AF**
Evidence is growing on differences in AF incidence, prevalence, risk fac-­
tors, comorbidities, and outcomes according to gender. [108] Women di-­
agnosed with AF are generally older, have more hypertension and heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and have less diag-­
nosed coronary artery disease (CAD). [109] Registry studies have re-­
ported differences in outcomes, with higher morbidity and mortality
in women, although these may be confounded by age and comorbidity
burden. [110][–][112] Women with AF may be more symptomatic, and report
a lower quality of life. [41][,][113] It is unclear whether this is related to de-­
layed medical assessment in women, or whether there are genuine
sex differences. Despite a higher symptom load, women are less likely
to undergo AF ablation than men, even though antiarrhythmic drug
therapy seems to be associated with more proarrhythmic events in
women. [109] These observations call for more research on gender
differences in order to prevent disparities and inequality in care.
Other diversity aspects such as age, race, ethnicity, and transgender
issues, as well as social determinants (including socioeconomic status,
disability, education level, health literacy, and rural/urban location) are
important contributors to inequality that should be actively considered
to improve patient outcomes. [114]

**4.2. Principles of AF-CARE**
The *2024 ESC Guidelines for the management of AF* have compiled and
evolved past approaches to create principles of management to aid im-­
plementation of these guidelines, and hence improve patient care and
outcomes. There is growing evidence that clinical support tools [115][–][118]

can aid best-practice management, with the caveat that any tool is a
guide only, and that all patients require personalized attention. The
AF-CARE approach covers many established principles in the manage-­
ment of AF, but does so in a systematic, time-orientated format with
four essential treatment pillars ( *Figure 3* ; central illustration). Joint man-­
agement with each patient forms the starting point of the AF-CARE ap-­
proach. Notably, it takes account of the growing evidence base that
therapies for AF are most effective when associated health conditions

are addressed. A careful search for these comorbidities and risk factors

[C] is critical and should be applied in all patients with a diagnosis of AF.
Avoidance of stroke and thromboembolism [A] in patients with risk


factors is considered next, focused on appropriate use of anticoagu-­
lant therapy. Reducing AF-related symptoms and morbidity by effect-­
ive use of heart rate and rhythm control [R] is then applied, which in
selected patients may also reduce hospitalization or improve progno-­
sis. The potential benefit of rhythm control, accompanied by consid-­
eration of all risks involved, should be considered in all patients at each
contact point with healthcare professionals. As AF, and its related co-­
morbidities, changes over time, different levels of evaluation [E] and
re-evaluation are required in each patient, and these approaches
should be dynamic. Due to the wide variability in response to therapy,
and the changing pathophysiology of AF as age and comorbidities ad-­
vance, reassessment should be built into the standard care pathway to
prevent adverse outcomes for patients and improve population

health.

AF-CARE builds upon prior ESC Guidelines, e.g. the five-step
outcome-focused integrated approach in the *2016 ESC Guidelines for*
*the management of AF*, [119] and the AF Better Care (ABC) pathway in
the *2020 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AF* . [120]

The reorganization into AF-CARE was based on the parallel develop-­
ments in new approaches and technologies (in particular for rhythm
control), with new evidence consistently suggesting that all aspects of
AF management are more effective when comorbidities and risk factors
have been considered. This includes management relating to symptom
benefit, improving prognosis, prevention of thromboembolism, and the
response to rate and rhythm control strategies. AF-CARE makes expli-­
cit the need for individualized evaluation and follow-up in every patient,
with an active approach that accounts for how patients, their AF, and
associated comorbidities change over time. The AF-CARE principles
have been applied to different patient pathways for ease of implemen-­
tation into routine clinical care. This includes the management of firstdiagnosed AF ( *Figure 4* ), paroxysmal AF ( *Figure 5* ), persistent AF
( *Figure 6* ), and permanent AF ( *Figure 7* ).

###### **5. [C] Comorbidity and risk factor ** **management**

A broad array of comorbidities are associated with the recurrence
and progression of AF. Managing comorbidities is also central to the
success of other aspects of care for patients with AF, with evidence
available for hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, obesity,
and sleep apnoea, along with lifestyle changes that improve physical


[activity and reduce alcohol intake (see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
*[Additional Evidence Table S4](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). Identification and treatment of these
comorbidities and clusters of risk factors form an important part
of effective AF-CARE ( *Figure 8* ), with the evidence outlined in the
rest of this section highlighting where management can improve
patient outcomes or prevent AF recurrence. Many of these
factors (and more) are also associated with incident AF (see
*Section 10* ).

Recommendation Table 5 **— Recommendations for**
**comorbidity and risk factor management in AF (see**
**also Evidence Table 5)**


**5.1. Hypertension**
Hypertension in patients with AF is associated with an increased risk of
stroke, heart failure, major bleeding, and cardiovascular mortality. [158][–][161]

The target for treated systolic blood pressure (BP) in most adults is
120–129 mmHg. Where BP-lowering treatment is poorly tolerated,
clinically significant frailty exists or the patient’s age is 85 years or
older, a more lenient target of <140 mmHg is acceptable or ‘as low
as reasonably achievable’. On-treatment diastolic BP should ideally
be 70–79 mmHg. [162] In an individual participant data meta-analysis of
22 randomized trials reporting baseline AF, a 5 mmHg reduction in
systolic BP reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 9%
(HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–1.00), with identical effect in patients with
AF or sinus rhythm. [129]

In individuals with AF, hypertension often coexists with other
modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors that all contribute to re-­
currence of AF, readmission to hospital, and ongoing symptoms after
rhythm control. [163][–][171] Optimal control of blood pressure should be
considered an essential component of treating AF and undertaken
within a strategy of comprehensive risk factor management. [126][–][128]

Although the majority of research has focused on clinical outcomes,
limited comparative data on hypertension medication suggests that
use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angioten-­
sin receptor blockers (ARB) may be superior for prevention of recur-­
rent AF. [172][–][175]

**5.2. Heart failure**

Heart failure is a key determinant of prognosis in patients with AF, as
well as an important factor associated with recurrence and progression
of AF. [176][,][177] During 30 years of follow-up in the Framingham cohort,
57% of those with new heart failure had concomitant AF, and 37% of
those with new AF had heart failure. [178] Numerous cardiovascular

and non-cardiovascular conditions impact the development of both
AF and heart failure, leading to the common pathway of atrial cardio-­
myopathy. [18] In patients with acute heart failure attending the emer-­
gency department, AF is one of the most prevalent triggering factors
of the episode. [179] The development of heart failure in patients with
AF is associated with a two-fold increase in stroke and thrombo-­
embolism, [180] even after anticoagulation, [181] and 25% higher all-cause
mortality. [178] Prognosis may be affected by left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF), with the rate of death highest with the combination
of AF and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)
(LVEF ≤ 40%), as compared with AF and HFpEF (LVEF ≥ 50%).
However, rates of stroke and incident heart failure hospitalization
are similar regardless of LVEF. [182] Due to how common concomitant
AF and heart failure are in clinical practice, strategies to improve out-­
comes in these patients are detailed within each component of the
AF-CARE pathway. However, it is also critical that heart failure itself
is managed appropriately in patients with AF to prevent avoidable ad-­

verse events.

Optimization of heart failure management should follow current
ESC Guidelines: 2023 Focused Update [183] of the 2021 ESC Guidelines
for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure. [137]

Achieving euvolaemia with diuretics is an important first step that not
only manages the heart failure component, but can also facilitate better
control of heart rate in AF. For HFrEF, it should be highlighted that
many older guideline-recommended therapies lack specific evidence
for benefit in patients with coexisting AF. No trial data are available
in this context for ACE inhibitors, there are conflicting data on
ARBs, [132][,][184] and an individual patient-level analysis of RCTs found no

difference between beta-blockers and placebo for all-cause mortality in
HFrEF with AF. [133] However, these drugs have clear proof of safety and
there may be other indications for these therapies beyond prognosis,
including comorbidity management and symptom improvement.
These and other therapies may also have dual functions, for example,
beta-blockers or digoxin for rate control of AF, in addition to improving
heart failure metrics and reducing hospitalization. [48][,][185][,][186] More recent
additions to HFrEF management, such as eplerenone, sacubitrilvalsartan, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors,
had substantial numbers of patients with AF enrolled in RCTs, with
no evidence that AF status affected their ability to reduce cardiovascu-­
lar mortality/heart failure hospitalization. [134][–][136] Cardiac resynchroniza-­
tion therapy (CRT) in the context of HFrEF and AF is discussed in detail
in the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchroni-­
zation therapy, with an important focus on ensuring effective biventri-­
cular pacing (with a low threshold for considering atrioventricular node
ablation). [187] Patients who have heart failure with mildly reduced ejec-­
tion fraction (HFmrEF) (LVEF 41%–49%) and AF should generally be
treated according to guidance for HFrEF, [137] albeit with limited evidence
to date in AF. [188][–][190] For treatment of HFpEF and AF, [191] pre-specified
subgroup data on AF from multiple large trials show that the SGLT2
inhibitors dapagliflozin, empaglifozin, and sotagliflozin are effective in
improving prognosis. [138][–][140]

Appropriate management of heart failure has the potential to reduce
recurrence of AF, e.g. by reducing adverse atrial and ventricular myo-­
cardial remodelling, but there are limited data for specific therapies.
In the Routine versus Aggressive upstream rhythm Control for preven-­
tion of Early AF in heart failure (RACE 3) trial, combined management
of mild-to-moderate heart failure with ACE inhibitors/ARBs, mineralo-­
corticoid receptor antagonists, statins, and cardiac rehabilitation in-­
creased the maintenance of sinus rhythm on ambulatory monitoring
at 12 months. [39] This benefit was not preserved at the 5 year follow-up,
although this may have been confounded by the lack of ongoing inter-­
vention beyond the initial 12 months. [192]

**5.3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus**
Diabetes mellitus is present in around 25% of patients with AF. [193][–][195]

Patients with both diabetes and AF have a worse prognosis, [196] with in-­
creased healthcare utilization and excess mortality and cardiovascular
events. The prevalence and incidence of AF and type 2 diabetes are
widely increasing, thus making the association of these two conditions
a public health challenge. [195][,][197] Moreover, diabetes is a major factor in-­
fluencing thromboembolic risk. [198][,][199] Following catheter ablation of AF,
diabetes and higher HbA1c are associated with increased length of stay
and a greater recurrence of AF. [200][–][203]

In cohort studies, the management of diabetes mellitus as part of
comprehensive risk factor management has been associated with re-­
duced AF symptoms, burden, reversal of the type of AF (from persist-­
ent to paroxysmal or no AF), and improved maintenance of sinus
rhythm. [126][–][128] However, robust evidence is limited, and individual
glucose-lowering medications have had variable effects on AF. [204][–][206]

There are emerging data of the use of SGLT2 and glucagon-like
peptide-1 antagonists in patients with diabetes and AF that may impact
on treatment choice in the near future. Importantly, diabetes frequently
coexists with multiple risk factors in patients with AF, and a compre-­
hensive approach to management is required. Further details are


provided in the 2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovas-­
cular disease in patients with diabetes. [207]

**5.4. Obesity**
Obesity frequently coexists with other risk factors that have been inde-­
pendently associated with the development of AF. [208][,][209] Obesity (body
mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m [2] ) and being overweight (BMI >25 kg/m [2] )
are associated with a greater risk of recurrent atrial arrhythmias after
AF ablation (13% increase for every 5 kg/m [2 ] higher BMI). [210][–][212] In
the setting of comprehensive risk factor management, weight loss of
≥10% in overweight and obese individuals with AF has been associated
with reduced AF symptoms and AF burden in an RCT (aiming for BMI
<27 kg/m [2] ). [125] Cohort studies have also shown a graded response to
maintenance of sinus rhythm, [126] improved ablation outcomes, [128] and
reversal of the type of AF [127] commensurate with the degree of weight
loss and risk factor management. However, in the Supervised Obesity
Reduction Trial for AF Ablation Patients (SORT-AF) randomized trial
in AF ablation patients, a sole weight loss intervention that achieved
4% loss in weight over 12 months did not impact ablation outcomes. [213]

This is consistent with the findings in LEGACY (Long-Term Effect of
Goal directed weight management on Atrial Fibrillation Cohort: a 5
Year follow-up study) that showed that weight loss of ≤3% had no im-­
pact on AF recurrence. [126] Observational studies have raised the possi-­
bility of a point of no return in terms of the benefit of weight loss, [214] but
also the possibility that bariatric surgery can improve symptoms and re-­
duce AF recurrence. [215][–][217]

**5.5. Obstructive sleep apnoea**
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a highly prevalent condition, particu-­
larly in patients with AF. [157][,][218] Optimal screening tools in the AF popu-­
lation are still under evaluation, although it may be reasonable to screen
for OSA in patients where a rhythm control strategy is being pursued.
Polysomnography or home sleep apnoea testing are suggested in pref-­
erence to screening questionnaires. [155][–][157][,][219] Questionnaires assessing
daytime sleepiness are poor predictors of moderate-to-severe OSA. [155]

Which parameter should be used to focus on risk of AF in patients with
OSA, and to guide OSA treatment in patients with AF, is still
unclear. [220][,][221]

Observational studies have suggested that individuals with OSA not
treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) respond
poorly to treatments for AF, with an increased risk of recurrence
after cardioversion or ablation. [222] Conversely, OSA patients treated
with CPAP seem to mitigate their propensity toward developing
AF. [148][–][153][,][222][–][224] A small randomized trial of CPAP vs. no therapy de-­
monstrated reversal of atrial remodelling in individuals with moderate
OSA. [154] However, other small RCTs have failed to show a benefit of
CPAP therapy on ablation outcomes [225] or post-cardioversion. [226]

Data on the cardiovascular mortality benefit of CPAP therapy in
OSA are inconclusive. [227][–][230]

**5.6. Physical inactivity**
Reduced cardiorespiratory fitness frequently coexists with other modi-­
fiable risk factors and has been associated with a greater recurrence of
AF after catheter ablation. [141] Better cardiorespiratory fitness has a de-­
monstrated inverse relationship to AF burden in both middle-aged and
elderly people. [141] Small RCTs, meta-analyses, and observational

ESC Guidelines **3341**


cohorts have shown that regular aerobic exercise may also improve
AF-related symptoms, quality of life, and exercise capacity. [142][,][143]

Better cardiorespiratory fitness and a gain in cardiorespiratory fitness
over time are associated with a greater reduction in AF burden and im-­
proved maintenance of sinus rhythm. [141][–][145]

**5.7. Alcohol excess**

Alcohol consumption can increase the risk of adverse events in patients
with AF, such as thromboembolism, death, or AF-related hospitaliza-­
tion. [231][,][232] Alcohol is associated with an increased risk of ischaemic

stroke in patients with newly diagnosed AF, and alcohol abstinence after
AF diagnosis can reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke. [233] In patients re-­
ceiving OAC, alcohol excess is associated with a greater risk of bleed-­
ing, [234] mediated by poor adherence, alcohol–drug interactions, liver
disease, and variceal bleeding.

Alcohol consumption is associated with a dose-dependent increase
in the recurrence of AF after catheter ablation. [147][,][235] In an RCT among
regular non-binge drinkers with AF, the goal of abstinence led to a sig-­
nificant reduction in AF recurrence and burden; alcohol intake was re-­
duced from 16.8 to 2.1 standard drinks per week (≤30 grams or 3
standard drinks of alcohol) in the intervention arm, with 61% attaining
abstinence. [147] In observational data of patients undergoing catheter ab-­
lation, reduction of consumption to ≤7 standard drinks (≤70 grams of
alcohol) per week was associated with improved maintenance of sinus
rhythm. [128][,][235]
###### **6. [A] Avoid stroke and ** **thromboembolism**

**6.1. Initiating oral anticoagulation**
Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for thromboembolism, irre-­
spective of whether it is paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent. [236][,][237]

Left untreated, and dependent on other patient-specific factors, the
risk of ischaemic stroke in AF is increased five-fold, and one in every
five strokes is associated with AF. [238] The default approach should
therefore be to provide OAC to all eligible patients, except those

at low risk of incident stroke or thromboembolism. The effectiveness

of OAC to prevent ischaemic stroke in patients with AF is well estab-­
lished. [239][,][240] Antiplatelet drugs alone (aspirin, or aspirin in combin-­
ation with clopidogrel) are not recommended for stroke prevention
in AF. [241][,][242]

**6.1.1. Decision support for anticoagulation in AF**

Tools have been developed to enable easier implementation of OAC
in patients with clinical AF. The majority of OAC clinical trials have
used variations of the CHADS 2 score to indicate those at risk (with
points for chronic heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, and 2
points for prior stroke/transient ischaemic attack [TIA]). Although
most available stroke risk scores are simple and practical, the predict-­
ive value of scores is generally modest (see [Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
online, *[Table S3](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). [243][–][245] Classification and discrimination of adverse
events is relatively poor for all scores and hence the benefit of using
them to select patients for OAC is unclear. There is also considerable
variation in the definition of risk factors across countries, [246] and a lack
of evidence from clinical trials on the ability of stroke risk scoring to
enhance clinical practice. [243] This guideline continues to provide a


Class IA recommendation for the use of OAC in patients at risk of
thromboembolism. However, in the absence of strong evidence for
how to apply risk scores in real-world patients, this has been sepa-­
rated from the use of any particular risk score. This is also in line
with regulatory approvals for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs),
which do not stipulate risk scores or numerical thresholds. [25][–][28][,][245]

Substantive changes have occurred in the decades since these risk
scores were developed in regards to population-level risk factor pro-­
files, therapies, and targets. [198] Historical scores do not take into ac-­
count parameters that have been associated with thromboembolism
in contemporary cohorts, such as cancer, chronic kidney disease
(CKD), ethnicity, and a range of circulating biomarkers (including tropo-­
nin and B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]). As an example, for CKD
there is a correlation between decreasing glomerular filtration rate
and proteinuria with stroke risk, [247][–][250] and cohort data suggest a twofold increased risk of ischaemic stroke and mortality in AF patients with
CKD vs. without. [251] Other factors, such as atrial enlargement, hyperlip-­
idaemia, smoking, and obesity, have been identified in specific cohort
studies as additional risk factors for ischaemic stroke in AF. [70][,][252][,][253]

Biomarkers, such as troponin, natriuretic peptides, growth differenti-­
ation factor-15, cystatin C, and interleukin-6, can also indicate residual
stroke risk among anticoagulated AF patients. [254][,][255] Biomarker-guided
stroke prevention is currently being evaluated in an ongoing RCT
(NCT03753490). Until further validation within RCTs is available, this
task force continues to support using simple clinical classification for im-­
plementation of OAC. Clinicians should use tools that have been vali-­
dated in their local population and take an individualized approach to
thromboembolic risk stratification that considers the full range of
each patient’s specific risk factors. The absolute risk level at which to
start OAC in individual patients cannot be estimated from populationlevel studies. It will vary depending on how those factors interact with
other medical issues, and the degree of risk acceptable or tolerated by
that person. In general, most of the available risk scores have a thresh-­
old of 0.6%–1.0% per annum of thromboembolic events for clinical AF
to warrant OAC prescription.

Across Europe, the most popular risk score is CHA 2 DS 2 –VASc, giv-­
ing points for congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years
(2 points), diabetes mellitus, prior stroke/TIA/thromboembolism
(2 points), vascular disease, age 65–74 years and female sex.
However, implementation has varied in terms of gender. Female sex
is an age-dependent stroke risk modifier rather than a risk factor per
se. [112][,][256][,][257] The inclusion of gender complicates clinical practice both
for healthcare professionals and patients. [258] It also omits individuals
who identify as non-binary, transgender, or are undergoing sex hor-­
mone therapy. Previous guidelines from the ESC (and globally) have
not actually used CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc; instead providing different score le-­
vels for women and men with AF to qualify for OAC. Hence,
CHA 2 DS 2 -VA (excluding gender) has effectively been in place
( *Table 10* ). [78] This task force proposes, in the absence of other locally
validated alternatives, that clinicians and patients should use the
CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score to assist in decisions on OAC therapy (i.e. without
a criterion for birth sex or gender). Pending further trials in lower risk
patients (NCT04700826, [259] NCT02387229 [260] ), OAC are recom-­
mended in those with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score of 2 or more and should
be considered in those with a CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score of 1, following a
patient-centred and shared care approach. Healthcare professionals

should take care to assess for other thromboembolic risk factors

that may also indicate the need for OAC prescription.

**6.2. Oral anticoagulants**
Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), predominantly warfarin but also other
coumarin and indandione derivatives, have been the principal drugs to
prevent thromboembolic events in the context of AF. As with any
anticoagulant, a balance must be reached between preventing thrombo-­
embolism and preserving physiological haemostasis, with VKA-associated
intracranial and other major haemorrhage the most critical limitation for
acceptance of OAC. The global switch to DOACs as first-line therapy
has changed this risk–benefit balance, allowing more widespread pre-­
scription with no need for routine monitoring (see [Supplementary](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
data online, *[Additional Evidence Tables S5–S7](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). This component of AF
management may see substantive changes in the coming years, with a


number of factor XI inhibitors in various stages of clinical evaluation. A
phase 2 trial of abelacimab in patients with AF has shown lower rates
of bleeding compared with rivaroxaban [286] ; however, a phase 3 trial of
asundexian was terminated early due to lack of efficacy against apixaban
(NCT05643573), despite favourable phase 2 results. [287] Regardless of the
type of OAC prescribed, healthcare teams should be aware of the poten-­
tial for interactions with other drugs, foods, and supplements, and in-­
corporate this information into the education provided to patients and
their carers. The list of potential interactions with VKA is broad, [288][,][289]

but there are also some common cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular
drugs that interact with DOACs. [290][,][291] *Figure 9* highlights common and
major interactions to consider for VKAs and DOACs.

**6.2.1. Direct oral anticoagulants**

The DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) have all
demonstrated at least non-inferior efficacy compared with warfarin for
the prevention of thromboembolism, but with the added benefit of a
50% reduction in intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). [25][–][28] Meta-analyses of
individual data from 71 683 RCT patients showed that standard, full-dose
DOAC treatment compared with warfarin reduces the risk of stroke or
systemic embolism (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73–0.91), all-cause mortality (HR,
0.90; 95% CI, 0.85–0.95), and intracranial bleeding (HR, 0.48; 95% CI,
0.39–0.59), with no significant difference in other major bleeding (HR,
0.86; 95% CI, 0.73–1.00) and little or no between-trial heterogeneity. [292]

Post-marketing observational data on the effectiveness and safety of
dabigatran, [313][,][314] rivaroxaban, [315][,][316] apixaban, [317] and edoxaban [318] vs.
warfarin show general consistency with the respective phase 3 RCTs.

For patients undergoing cardioversion, three underpowered trials
showed non-significantly lower rates of cardiovascular events with
DOACs compared with warfarin. [319][–][321] In meta-analysis of these
5203 patients predominantly undergoing electrical cardioversion, the
composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction (MI),
and cardiovascular death was significantly lower at 0.42% in
patients randomized to a DOAC vs. 0.98% in those allocated VKA


(risk ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21–0.86; *P* = .017), with no heterogeneity be-­
tween trials and no significant difference in major bleeding. [293]

Specific patient subgroups show consistent benefit with DOACs vs.
VKAs. For heart failure, major thromboembolic events were lower in
DOAC-treated patients vs. warfarin in subgroup analysis of landmark
RCTs, [322] confirmed in large-scale real-world data. [323] In a retrospective
cohort of patients aged over 80 years, DOAC use was associated with a
lower risk of ischaemic stroke, dementia, mortality, and major bleeding
than warfarin, [324] but this may be confounded by prescription bias.

Direct oral anticoagulants retain their efficacy and safety over VKAs
in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD (creatinine clearance

[CrCl] >30 mL/min), [325] although specific dosing adjustments
apply. [25][–][28][,][326] In Europe, reduced doses of rivaroxaban, apixaban, and
edoxaban are approved in patients with severe CKD (CrCl 15–29 mL/
min), although limited numbers of patients were included in the major
RCTs against VKA. [327] Dabigatran is more dependent on renal elimination
and so is contraindicated with an estimated glomerular filtration rate
<30 mL/min/1.73 m [2] . Small trials have been performed in patients on
haemodialysis, with two finding no difference between apixaban 2.5 mg
twice daily and VKA for efficacy or safety outcomes, [328][,][329] and one trial
showing that rivaroxaban 10 mg led to significantly lower rates of cardiovas-­
cular events and major bleeding compared with VKA. [330] Careful institution
and regular follow-up are advised when instituting anticoagulants in any pa-­
tient with impaired renal function (See [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
*[Additional Evidence Table 8](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). [326]

Direct oral anticoagulants as a class should be avoided in specific pa-­
tient groups, such as those with mechanical heart valves or
moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis. In patients with mechanical heart
valves, an excess of thromboembolic and major bleeding events among
patients on dabigatran therapy vs. VKA was observed, with an RCT ter-­
minated prematurely. [331] A trial of apixaban vs. VKA after implantation
of a mechanical aortic valve was also stopped due to excess thrombo-­
embolic events in the apixaban group. [332] The restriction on DOAC use
does not apply to bioprosthetic heart valves (including mitral) or after
transcatheter aortic valve implantation, where DOACs can be used and
trial data show non-inferiority for clinical events compared with
VKAs. [304][,][333][,][334] With regards to mitral stenosis, the DOAC vs. VKA
trials excluded patients with moderate-to-severe disease. In 4531 ran-­
domized patients with rheumatic heart disease and AF, VKAs led to a
lower rate of composite cardiovascular events and death than rivarox-­
aban, without a higher rate of bleeding. [294] Eighty-two per cent of the
patients included had a mitral valve area ≤2 cm, supporting the restric-­
tion of DOAC use in patients with moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis.
Note that patients with other types of valve disease (mitral regurgita-­
tion and others) should preferentially be prescribed a DOAC, and

the term ‘valvular’ AF is obsolete and should be avoided.

Inappropriate dose reductions for DOACs are frequent in clinical
practice, [311] but need to be avoided as they increase the risk of stroke with-­
out decreasing bleeding risk. [310] Hence, DOAC therapy should be instituted
according to the standard full dose as tested in phase 3 RCTs and approved
by regulators ( *Table 11* ). The prescribed dosage should consider the individ-­
ual patient’s profile. [335] Drug interactions need to be considered in all pa-­
tients taking or planned for DOACs (see *Figure 9* for common drug
interactions). [336] There is insufficient evidence currently to advise on routine
laboratory testing for DOAC levels. However, in certain situations, meas-­
urement of DOAC levels (where available) may be helpful, such as severe
bleeding, the need for urgent surgery, or thromboembolic events despite
apparent DOAC compliance. [337][,][338] Patients should always be involved in
decision-making on anticoagulation, [339] leading to better alignment with per-­
sonal preferences that can help to increase understanding and adherence.

DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant.
Dose and dose adjustments are taken from the European Medicines Association Summary of Product Characteristics for each DOAC. There may be other patient-specific reasons
for providing a reduced dose, but, in general, the standard full dose should be used to provide optimal prevention of thromboembolism related to AF. Note that antiplatelet agents
should be stopped in most patients when commencing a DOAC (see *Section 6.3* ). A number of drug interactions exist with each DOAC and should be taken into consideration
(see *Figure 9* ).


**6.2.2. Vitamin K antagonists**

Vitamin K antagonist therapy reduces stroke risk by 64% and mortality
by 26% in patients with AF at elevated thromboembolic risk (mostly
warfarin in trials, compared with placebo or no treatment). [239]

Vitamin K antagonists are still used in many patients worldwide, but
prescriptions have declined sharply since the introduction of
DOACs. [340][,][341] Vitamin K antagonists are currently the only treatment
option in AF patients with mechanical heart valves or moderate-tosevere mitral valve stenosis. [294][,][331] The use of VKAs is not only limited
by numerous drug and food interactions ( *Figure 9* ), but also a narrow
therapeutic range. This requires frequent monitoring and dose adjust-­
ment according to the prothrombin time expressed as the international
normalized ratio (INR). [342] If the time in therapeutic range (TTR) is
maintained for long periods (e.g. >70% with INR 2.0–3.0), then VKA
can be effective for thromboembolic protection with an acceptable
safety profile. [295][–][297][,][343] However, VKAs are associated with higher
rates of intracranial bleeding, [299][,][300] and also higher rates of other types
of bleeding compared with DOACs. [83]

In view of the potential safety benefits, switching from VKAs to a
DOAC is justified where there are concerns about intracranial bleeding
or for patient-choice reasons, and a switch is recommended where pa-­
tients have failed to maintain an adequate TTR (<70%). This depends
on patients fulfilling eligibility criteria for DOACs and should take into ac-­
count other correctable reasons for poor INR control. There is limited
data on switching OAC in older patients (≥75 years) with polypharmacy
or other markers of frailty. A recent trial in this patient group premature-­
ly stopped for futility showed that switching from VKAs to DOACs led
to a higher primary outcome rate of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events compared with continuing with INR-guided


VKA (17.8 vs. 10.5 per 100 patient-years, driven by non-major bleeds). [309]

Hence, in such patients who are clinically stable with good TTR, VKAs
may be continued rather than switching to a DOAC after an open discus-­
sion with the patient and shared decision-making.

**6.2.3. Clinical vs. device-detected subclinical AF**

The known benefit of anticoagulation applies to clinical AF. Two RCTs
have been published assessing the value of DOAC therapy in devicedetected subclinical AF. The ARTESiA trial (Apixaban for the

Reduction of Thromboembolism in Patients With Device-Detected

Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation) was completed with 4012 patients
with device-detected subclinical AF and a mean follow-up of 3.5
years. [282] The primary efficacy outcome of stroke or systemic embolism
was significantly less in those randomized to apixaban compared with
aspirin (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45–0.88; *P* = .007). In the intention-to-treat
analysis, the primary safety outcome of major bleeding was higher with
apixaban (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.01–1.82; *P* = .04). The NOAH trial (Nonvitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Patients With Atrial High
Rate Episodes) was stopped prematurely due to safety concerns and
futility for the efficacy of edoxaban, and hence provides limited informa-­
tion. [281] The analysis of 2536 patients with device-detected atrial highrate episodes and a median follow-up of 21 months identified no differ-­
ence in a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or embolism com-­
paring edoxaban and placebo (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.60–1.08;
*P* = .15). Those randomized to edoxaban had a higher rate of the
composite of death or major bleeding than placebo (HR, 1.31;
95% CI, 1.02–1.67; *P* = .03). Patients had a low burden of devicedetected subclinical AF in both trials (median duration 1.5 h and

**3346** ESC Guidelines


2.8 h, respectively), with lower rates of thromboembolism (around 1%
per patient-year) than would be expected for an equivalent cohort of
patients with clinical AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 4.

Considering the trade-off between potential benefit and the risk of
major bleeding, this task force concludes that DOAC therapy may be
considered in subgroups of patients with asymptomatic devicedetected subclinical AF who have high estimated stroke risk and an ab-­
sence of major bleeding risk factors (see *Section 6.7* ). The duration and
burden of subclinical AF that could indicate potential benefit from OAC
remains uncertain. [344] Regardless of the initial decision on OAC, pa-­
tients with subclinical AF should receive management and follow-up
for all aspects of AF-CARE as the risk of developing clinical AF is high
(6%–9% per year).

**6.3. Antiplatelet drugs and combinations**
**with anticoagulants**
Antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, are not an alternative
to OAC. They should not be used for stroke prevention, and can lead
to potential harm (especially among elderly patients with AF). [345][–][347] In
ACTIVE W (Atrial fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for
prevention of Vascular Events), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with
aspirin and clopidogrel was less effective than warfarin for the preven-­
tion of stroke, systemic embolism, MI, or vascular death (annual risk of
events 5.6% vs. 3.9%, respectively; *P* = .0003), with similar rates of
major bleeding. [348] The AVERROES (Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic

Acid to Prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed

or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment) trial demon-­
strated a lower rate of stroke or systemic embolism with apixaban
compared with aspirin (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32–0.62; *P* < .001), with
no significant difference in major bleeding (there were 11 cases of intra-­
cranial bleeding with apixaban and 13 with aspirin). [242]

The combination of OAC with antiplatelet agents (especially aspirin)
without an adequate indication occurs frequently in clinical practice
(see Supplementary data online, *Additional Evidence Table S9* ). [349][,][350]

Bleeding events are more common when antithrombotic agents are
combined, and no clear benefit has been observed in terms of preven-­
tion of stroke or death. [349] In general, combining antiplatelet drugs with
anticoagulants (DOACs or VKAs) should only occur in selected pa-­
tients with acute vascular disease (e.g. acute coronary syndromes; see
*Section 9.2* ). The combination of low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg) with
aspirin reduced the risk of stroke in patients with chronic vascular dis-­
ease in a subanalysis of the COMPASS (Cardiovascular Outcomes for
People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) trial, [351][,][352] but this cannot
be generalized to AF patients because those with an indication for fulldose anticoagulants were excluded.

Recommendation Table 8 **— Recommendations for**
**combining antiplatelet drugs with anticoagulants for**
**stroke prevention (see also Evidence Table 8)**


**6.4. Residual ischaemic stroke risk despite**
**anticoagulation**
Although OAC significantly reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke in pa-­
tients with AF, there remains a residual risk. [252][,][354] One-third of patients
with AF presenting with an ischaemic stroke are already on anticoagu-­
lation, [355] with heterogeneous aetiology. [356] This may include non-AFrelated competing stroke mechanisms (such as large artery and small
vessel diseases), non-adherence to therapy, an inappropriately low
dose of anticoagulant, or thromboembolism despite sufficient anticoa-­
gulation. [357] Laboratory measurement of INR or DOAC levels may con-­
tribute to revealing an amenable cause of the stroke. Regardless of
anticoagulation status, patients with ischaemic stroke are more likely
to have cardiovascular risk factors. [358] Many clinicians managing patients
with an incident stroke despite taking anticoagulation will be tempted
to switch their anticoagulant regimen. While there may be some advan-­
tage in switching from VKAs to DOACs for protection against future
recurrent ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, this task force does not
recommend routinely switching from one DOAC to another, or
from a DOAC to a VKA, since this has no proven efficacy. [252][,][356][,][359]

There may be individual reasons for switching, including potential inter-­
actions with new drugs; however, there is no consistent data across
countries that adherence or efficacy differs between once- and twicedaily approaches. [360][,][361] Emerging, but observational evidence suggests
that switching provides limited reduction in the risk of recurrent ischae-­
mic stroke. [252][,][356][,][359] The alternative strategy of adding antiplatelet
therapy to OAC may lead to an increased risk of bleeding. [356][,][359]

Aside from thorough attention to underlying risk factors and co-­
morbidities, the approach to management of patients with a stroke des-­
pite OAC remains a distinct challenge.

Watchman device. The 5-year pooled outcomes demonstrated a simi-­
lar rate of the composite endpoint (cardiovascular or unexplained
death, systemic embolism, and stroke) between the LAAO and war-­
farin arms. Those randomized to LAAO had significantly lower rates
of haemorrhagic stroke and all-cause death, but also a 71% nonsignificant increase in ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism. [364]

With DOACs demonstrating similar rates of major bleeding to as-­
pirin, [242] warfarin in the control arms in these trials is no longer standard
of care and hence the place of LAAO in current practice is unclear. The

Amulet occluder is an alternative LAAO device which was non-inferior

in an RCT to the Watchman device for safety events
(procedure-related complications, death, or major bleeding) and
thromboembolism. [365] In the PRAGUE-17 trial, 402 AF patients were
randomized to DOAC or LAAO (Watchman or Amulet), with noninferiority reported for a broad composite primary endpoint of stroke,
TIA, systemic embolism, cardiovascular death, major or non-major clin-­
ically relevant bleeding, and procedure/device-related complica-­
tions. [366][,][367] Larger trials [368][,][369] are expected to provide more
comprehensive data that can add to the current evidence base (see
Supplementary data online, *[Additional Evidence Table S10](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ).

[Pending further RCTs (see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Table S4* ), pa-­
tients with a contraindication to all of the OAC options (the four
DOACs and VKAs) have the most appropriate rationale for LAAO im-­
plantation, despite the paradox that the need for post-procedure
antithrombotic treatment exposes the patient to a bleeding risk that
may be equivalent to that of DOACs. Regulatory approvals based on
RCT protocols suggest the need for 45 days of VKA plus aspirin after
implantation, followed by 6 months of DAPT in patients with no major
peri-device leaks, and then ongoing aspirin (see [Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
online, *[Figure S2](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). [370][–][372] However, real-world practice is markedly dif-­
ferent and also varied. Direct oral anticoagulant administration at full
or reduced dose has been proposed as a treatment alternative to
warfarin. [373] Observational studies have also supported the use of anti-­
platelet therapy without associated increases in device-related throm-­
bosis or stroke. [374][–][376] In a propensity-matched comparison of patients
receiving limited early OAC vs. antiplatelet treatment post-Watchman
implantation, thromboembolic event rates and bleeding complications
were similar. [377] While waiting for solid RCT data (NCT03445949,
NCT03568890), [378] pertinent decisions on antithrombotic treatment
are usually made on an individualized basis. [379][–][381] Prevention of recur-­
rent stroke, in addition to OAC, is another potential indication for
LAAO. Only limited data are so far available from registries, [382] with on-­
going trials expected to provide more insight (NCT03642509,
NCT05963698).

Left atrial appendage occlusion device implantation is associated
with procedural risk including stroke, major bleeding, devicerelated thrombus, pericardial effusion, vascular complications, and
death. [362][,][383][–][385] Voluntary registries enrolling patients considered
ineligible for OAC have reported low peri-procedural
risk, [372][,][376][,][386][,][387] although national registries report in-hospital ma-­
jor adverse event rates of 9.5% in centres performing 5–15 LAAO
cases per year, and 5.6% performing 32–211 cases per year
( *P* < .001). [388] Registries with new-generation devices report a low-­
er complication rate compared with RCT data. [389][,][390] Device
related thrombi occur with an incidence of 1.7%–7.2% and are
associated with a higher risk of ischaemic stroke. [386][,][391][–][397] Their
detection can be documented as late as 1 year post-implantation
in one-fifth of patients, thus mandating a late ‘rule-out’ imaging ap-­
proach. [391] Likewise, follow-up screening for peri-device leaks is
relevant, as small leaks (0–5 mm) are present in ∼25% and have

**6.6. Surgical left atrial appendage occlusion**
Surgical occlusion or exclusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA) can
contribute to stroke prevention in patients with AF undergoing
cardiac surgery. [399][,][400] The Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study
(LAAOS III) randomized 4811 patients with AF to undergo or not
undergo LAAO at the time of cardiac surgery for another indication.
During a mean of 3.8 years follow-up, ischaemic stroke or systemic em-­
bolism occurred in 114 patients (4.8%) in the occlusion group and 168
(7.0%) in the control arm (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53–0.85; *P* = .001). [401]

The LAAOS III trial did not compare appendage occlusion with anticoa-­
gulation (77% of participants continued to receive OAC), and there-­
fore, surgical LAA closure should be considered as an adjunct
therapy to prevent thromboembolism in addition to anticoagulation
in patients with AF.

There are no RCT data showing a beneficial effect on ischaemic
stroke or systemic embolism in patients with AF undergoing LAAO
during endoscopic or hybrid AF ablation. A meta-analysis of RCT and
observational data showed no differences in stroke prevention or allcause mortality when comparing LAA clipping during thoracoscopic
AF ablation with percutaneous LAAO and catheter ablation. [402]

While the percutaneous LAAO/catheter ablation group showed a high-­
er acute success rate, it was also associated with a higher risk of haem-­
orrhage during the peri-operative period. In an observational study
evaluating 222 AF patients undergoing LAA closure using a clipping de-­
vice as a part of endoscopic or hybrid AF ablation, complete closure
was achieved in 95% of patients. [403] There were no intra-operative
complications, and freedom from a combined endpoint of ischaemic
stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, or TIA was 99.1% over 369 patient-years
of follow-up. Trials evaluating the beneficial effect of surgical LAA clos-­
ure in patients undergoing cardiac surgery but without a known history
of AF are ongoing (NCT03724318, NCT02701062). [404]

There is a potential advantage for stand-alone epicardial over
percutaneous LAA closure in patients with a contraindication for
OAC, as there is no need for post-procedure anticoagulation after epi-­
cardial closure. Observational data show that stand-alone LAA closure
using an epicardial clip is feasible and safe. [405] A multidisciplinary team
approach can facilitate the choice between epicardial or percutaneous
LAA closure in such patients. [406] The majority of safety data and experi-­
ence in epicardial LAA closure originate from a single clipping device
(AtriClip) [403][,][407][,][408] (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Additional*

observational studies have shown potential benefit from proton pump
inhibitors, [437] a large RCT in patients receiving low-dose anticoagulation
and/or aspirin for stable cardiovascular disease found that pantoprazole
had no significant impact on upper gastrointestinal bleeding events
compared with placebo (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.67–1.15). [438] Hence, the
use of gastric protection should be individualized for each patient
according to the totality of their perceived bleeding risk.

**6.7. Bleeding risk**
**6.7.1. Assessment of bleeding risk**
When initiating antithrombotic therapy, modifiable bleeding risk factors
should be managed to improve safety ( *Figure 10* ). [414][–][418] This includes
strict control of hypertension, advice to reduce excess alcohol intake,
avoidance of unnecessary antiplatelet or anti-inflammatory agents,
and attention to OAC therapy (adherence, control of TTR if on
VKAs, and review of interacting medications). Clinicians should con-­
sider the balance between stroke and bleeding risk—as factors for
both are dynamic and overlapping, they should be re-assessed at
each review depending on the individual patient. [419][–][421] Bleeding risk
factors are rarely a reason to withdraw or withhold OAC in eligible
patients, as the risk of stroke without anticoagulation often outweighs
the risk of major bleeding. [422][,][423] Patients with non-modifiable risk
factors should be reviewed more often, and where appropriate,
a multidisciplinary team approach should be instituted to guide

management.

Several bleeding risk scores have been developed to account for a
wide range of clinical factors (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
*Table S5* and *[Additional Evidence Tables S12](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* and *S13* ). [424] Systematic re-­
views and validation studies in external cohorts have shown contrasting
results and only modest predictive ability. [244][,][425][–][434] This task force
does not recommend a specific bleeding risk score given the uncer-­
tainty in accuracy and potential adverse implications of not providing
appropriate OAC to those at thromboembolic risk. There are very
few absolute contraindications to OAC (especially DOAC therapy).
Whereas primary intracranial tumours [435] or an intracerebral bleed re-­
lated to cerebral amyloid angiopathy [436] are examples where OAC
should be avoided, many other contraindications are relative or tem-­
porary. For example, a DOAC can often be safely initiated or reinitiated after acute bleeding has stopped, as long as the source has
been fully investigated and managed. Co-prescription of proton
pump inhibitors is common in clinical practice for patients receiving

**6.7.2. Management of bleeding on anticoagulant**
**therapy**

General management of bleeding in patients receiving OAC is outlined
in *Figure 11* . Cause-specific management is beyond the scope of these
guidelines, and will depend on the individual circumstances of the pa-­
tient and the healthcare environment. [447] Assessment of patients with
active bleeding should include confirmation of the bleeding site,
bleeding severity, type/dose/timepoint of last anticoagulant intake,
concomitant use of other antithrombotic agents, and other factors in-­
fluencing bleeding risk (renal function, platelet count, and medications
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories). INR testing and information
on recent results are invaluable for patients taking VKAs. Specific
coagulation tests for DOACs include diluted thrombin time, ecarin
clotting time, ecarin chromogenic assay for dabigatran, and chro-­
mogenic anti-factor Xa assay for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxa-­
ban. [447][–][449] Diagnostic and treatment interventions to identify and
manage the cause of bleeding (e.g. gastroscopy) should be performed
promptly.

In cases of minor bleeding, temporary withdrawal of OAC while the
cause is managed is usually sufficient, noting that the reduction in anti-­
coagulant effect is dependent on the INR level for VKAs or the half-life
of the particular DOAC.

For major bleeding events in patients taking VKAs, administration
of fresh frozen plasma restores coagulation more rapidly than
vitamin K, but prothrombin complex concentrates achieve even
faster blood coagulation with fewer complications, and so are
preferrable to achieve haemostasis. [450] In DOAC-treated patients
where the last DOAC dose was taken within 2–4 h, charcoal

administration and/or gastric lavage may reduce further exposure.
If the patient is taking dabigatran, idarucizumab can fully reverse its anti-­
coagulant effect and help to achieve haemostasis within 2–4 h in

uncontrolled bleeding. [451] Dialysis can also be effective in reducing dabiga-­
tran concentration. Andexanet alfa rapidly reverses the activity of factor
[Xa inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) (see Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
online, *[Additional evidence Table S14](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). An open-label RCT comparing
andexanet alfa to usual care in patients presenting with acute ICH within
6 h of symptom onset was stopped early due to improved control of
bleeding after 450 patients had been randomized. [452] As DOAC-specific
antidotes are not yet available in all institutions, prothrombin complex
concentrates are often used in cases of serious bleeding on factor Xa in-­
hibitors, with evidence limited to observational studies. [453]

Due to the complexities of managing bleeding in patients taking
OAC, it is advisable that each institution develop specific policies involv-­
ing a multidisciplinary team that includes cardiologists, haematologists,
emergency physicians/intensive care specialists, surgeons, and others.
It is also important to educate patients taking anticoagulants on the
signs and symptoms of bleeding events and to alert their healthcare
provider when such events occur. [335]

The decision to reinstate OAC will be determined by the severity,
cause, and subsequent management of bleeding, preferably by a multidis-­
ciplinary team and with close monitoring. Failure to reinstitute OAC after
a bleed significantly increases the risk of MI, stroke, and death. [454]

However, if the cause of severe or life-threatening bleeds cannot be trea-­
ted or reversed, the risk of ongoing bleeding may outweigh the benefit of
thromboembolic protection. [335]

Limiting tachycardia is an integral part of AF management and is often
sufficient to improve AF-related symptoms. Rate control is indicated as
initial therapy in the acute setting, in combination with rhythm control
therapies, or as the sole treatment strategy to control heart rate and
reduce symptoms. Limited evidence exists to inform the best type
and intensity of rate control treatment. [457] The approach to heart
rate control presented in *Figure 7* can be used for all types of AF, includ-­

###### **7. [R] Reduce symptoms by rate ** **and rhythm control**

Most patients diagnosed with AF will need therapies and/or interven-­
tions to control heart rate, revert to sinus rhythm, or maintain sinus
rhythm to limit symptoms or improve outcomes. While the concept
of choosing between rate and rhythm control is often discussed, in real-­
ity most patients require a combination approach which should be con-­
sciously re-evaluated during follow-up. Within a patient-centred and
shared-management approach, rhythm control should be a consider-­
ation in all suitable AF patients, with explicit discussion of benefits
and risks.

**3352** ESC Guidelines


**7.1.1. Indications and target heart rate**

The optimal heart rate target in AF patients depends on the setting,
symptom burden, presence of heart failure, and whether rate control
is combined with a rhythm control strategy. In the RACE II (Rate
Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation) RCT of patients
with permanent AF, lenient rate control (target heart rate <110 [beats
per minute] b.p.m.) was non-inferior to a strict approach (<80 b.p.m. at
rest; <110 b.p.m. during exercise; Holter for safety) for a composite of
clinical events, NYHA class, or hospitalization. [186][,][459] Similar results
were found in a post-hoc combined analysis from the AFFIRM (Atrial
Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management) and the
RACE (Rate Control versus Electrical cardioversion) studies. [474]

Therefore, lenient rate control is an acceptable initial approach, unless
there are ongoing symptoms or suspicion of tachycardia-induced car-­
diomyopathy, where stricter targets may be indicated.

**7.1.2. Heart rate control in the acute setting**
In acute settings, physicians should always evaluate and manage under-­
lying causes for the initiation of AF prior to, or in parallel to, instituting
acute rate and/or rhythm control. These include treating sepsis, addres-­
sing fluid overload, or managing cardiogenic shock. The choice of drug
( *Table 12* ) will depend on the patient’s characteristics, presence of heart
failure and LVEF, and haemodynamic profile ( *Figure 7* ). In general for
acute rate control, beta-blockers (for all LVEF) and diltiazem/verapamil
(for LVEF >40%) are preferred over digoxin because of their more
rapid onset of action and dose-dependent effects. [462][,][475][,][476] More se-­
lective beta-1 receptor blockers have a better efficacy and safety profile
than unselective beta-blockers. [477] Combination therapy with digoxin
may be required in acute settings (combination of beta-blockers with
diltiazem/verapamil should be avoided except in closely monitored
situations). [177][,][478] In selected patients who are haemodynamically
unstable or with severely impaired LVEF, intravenous amiodarone,
landiolol, or digoxin can be used. [472][,][473][,][479]

**7.1.3. Long-term heart rate control**

Pharmacological rate control can be achieved with beta-blockers,
diltiazem, verapamil, digoxin, or combination therapy ( *Table 12* ) (see
Supplementary data online, *[Additional Evidence Table S15](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). [480]

Table 12 **Drugs for rate control in AF**


The choice of rate control drugs depends on symptoms, comorbid-­
ities, and the potential for side effects and interactions. Combination
therapy of different rate-controlling drugs should be considered only
when needed to achieve the target heart rate, and careful follow-up
to avoid bradycardia is advised. Combining beta-blockers with verap-­
amil or diltiazem should only be performed in secondary care
with regular monitoring of heart rate by 24 h ECG to check for
bradycardia. [459] Some antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) also have ratelimiting properties (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol), but they should generally
be used only for rhythm control. Dronedarone should not be instituted
for rate control since it increases rates of heart failure, stroke, and
cardiovascular death in permanent AF. [481]

**Beta-blockers**, specifically beta-1 selective adrenoreceptor an-­
tagonists, are often first-line rate-controlling agents largely based on
their acute effect on heart rate and the beneficial effects demonstrated
in patients with chronic HFrEF. However, the prognostic benefit of
beta-blockers seen in HFrEF patients with sinus rhythm may not be pre-­
sent in patients with AF. [133][,][482]

**Verapamil** and **diltiazem** are non-dihydropyridine calcium channel
blockers. They provide rate control [461] and have a different adverse effect
profile, making verapamil or diltiazem useful for those experiencing side
effects from beta-blockers. [483] In a 60 patient crossover RCT, verapamil
and diltiazem did not lead to the same reduction in exercise capacity as
seen with beta-blockers, and had a beneficial impact on BNP. [480]

**Digoxin** and **digitoxin** are cardiac glycosides that inhibit the
sodium–potassium adenosine triphosphatase and augment parasympa-­
thetic tone. In RCTs, there is no association between the use of digoxin
and any increase in all-cause mortality. [185][,][484] Lower doses of digoxin
may be associated with better prognosis. [185] Serum digoxin concentra-­
tions can be monitored to avoid toxicity, [485] especially in patients at
higher risk due to older age, renal dysfunction, or use of interacting
medications. In RATE-AF (RAte control Therapy Evaluation in perman-­
ent Atrial Fibrillation), a trial in patients with symptomatic permanent
AF, there was no difference between low-dose digoxin and bisoprolol
for patient-reported quality of life outcomes at 6 months. However,
those randomized to digoxin demonstrated fewer adverse effects, a
greater improvement in mEHRA and NYHA scores, and a reduction
in BNP. [48] Two ongoing RCTs are addressing digoxin and digitoxin
use in patients with HFrEF with and without AF (EudraCT2013-005326-38, NCT03783429). [486]

Due to its broad extracardiac adverse effect profile, **amiodarone** is
reserved as a last option when heart rate cannot be controlled even
with maximal tolerated combination therapy, or in patients who do not
qualify for atrioventricular node ablation and pacing. Many of the adverse
effects from amiodarone have a direct relationship with cumulative dose,
restricting the long-term value of amiodarone for rate control. [487]

**7.1.4. Atrioventricular node ablation and pacemaker**
**implantation**

Ablation of the atrioventricular node and pacemaker implantation (‘ablate
and pace’) can lower and regularize heart rate in patients with AF (see
Supplementary data online, *[Additional Evidence Table S16](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). The procedure
has a low complication rate and a low long-term mortality risk. [468][,][488] The
pacemaker should be implanted a few weeks before the atrioventricular
node ablation, with the initial pacing rate after ablation set at 70–
90 b.p.m. [489][,][490] This strategy does not worsen LV function, [491] and may
even improve LVEF in selected patients. [492][,][493] The evidence base has typ-­
ically included older patients. For younger patients, ablate and pace should
only be considered if heart rate remains uncontrolled despite consideration
of other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options. The
choice of pacing therapy (right ventricular or biventricular pacing) depends
on patient characteristics, presence of heart failure, and LVEF. [187][,][494]

In severely symptomatic patients with permanent AF and at least one
hospitalization for heart failure, atrioventricular node ablation combined
with CRT should be considered. In the APAF-CRT (Ablate and Pace for
Atrial Fibrillation-cardiac resynchronization therapy) trial in a population
with narrow QRS complexes, atrioventricular node ablation combined
with CRT was superior to rate control drugs for the primary outcomes
(all-cause mortality, and death or hospitalization for heart failure), and sec-­
ondary outcomes (symptom burden and physical limitation). [470][,][471]

Conduction system pacing may become a potentially useful alternate pa-­
cing mode when implementing a pace and ablate strategy, once safety and
efficacy have been confirmed in larger RCTs. [495][,][496] In CRT recipients, the
presence (or occurrence) of AF is one of the main reasons for suboptimal
biventricular pacing. [187] Improvement of biventricular pacing is indicated
and can be reached by intensification of rate control drug regimens, atrio-­
ventricular node ablation, or rhythm control, depending on patient and AF
characteristics. [187]


**7.2. Rhythm control strategies in patients**
**with AF**

**7.2.1. General principles and anticoagulation**
Rhythm control refers to therapies dedicated to restoring and main-­
taining sinus rhythm. These treatments include cardioversion, AADs,
percutaneous catheter ablation, endoscopic and hybrid ablation, and
open surgical approaches (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Additional*
*[Evidence Table S17](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). Rhythm control is never a strategy on its own; in-­
stead, it should always be part of the AF-CARE approach.

In patients with acute or worsening haemodynamic instability thought to
be caused by AF, rapid electrical cardioversion is recommended. For other
patients, a wait-and-see approach should be considered as an alternative to
immediate cardioversion ( *Figure 12* ). The Rate Control versus Electrical
Cardioversion Trial 7–Acute Cardioversion versus Wait and See (RACE
7 ACWAS) trial in patients with recent-onset symptomatic AF without
haemodynamic compromise showed a wait-and-see approach for spon-­
taneous conversion until 48 h after the onset of AF symptoms was noninferior as compared with immediate cardioversion at 4 weeks follow-up. [10]

Since the publication of landmark trials more than 20 years ago, the
main reason to consider longer-term rhythm control therapy has been
the reduction in symptoms from AF. [497][–][500] Older studies have shown
that the institution of a rhythm control strategy using AADs does not re-­
duce mortality and morbidity when compared with a rate control-only
strategy, [497][–][500] and may increase hospitalization. [457] In contrast, multiple
studies have shown that rhythm control strategies have a positive effect
on quality of life once sinus rhythm is maintained. [501][,][502] Therefore, in the
case of uncertainty of the presence of symptoms associated with AF, an
attempt to restore sinus rhythm is a rational first step. In patients with
symptoms, patient factors that favour an attempt at rhythm control
should be considered, including suspected tachycardiomyopathy, a brief
AF history, non-dilated left atrium, or patient preference.

Rhythm control strategies have significantly evolved due to an increas-­
ing experience in the safe use of antiarrhythmic drugs, [17] consistent use of
OAC, improvements in ablation technology, [503][–][509] and identification and
management of risk factors and comorbidities. [39][,][510][,][511] In the ATHENA

Cardiovascular Hospitalization or Death from Any Cause in Patients with
Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter), dronedarone significantly reduced the
risk of hospitalization due to cardiovascular events or death as compared
with placebo in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. [512] The
CASTLE-AF trial (Catheter Ablation versus Standard Conventional
Treatment in Patients With Left Ventricle Dysfunction and AF) demon-­
strated that a rhythm control strategy with catheter ablation can improve
mortality and morbidity in selected patients with HFrEF and an implanted
cardiac device. [4] In end-stage HFrEF, the CASTLE-HTx trial (Catheter
Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation in Patients With End-Stage Heart Failure
and Eligibility for Heart Transplantation) found, in a single centre, that
catheter ablation combined with guideline-directed medical therapy sig-­
nificantly reduced the composite of death from any cause, implantation
of left ventricular assist device, or urgent heart transplantation compared
with medical treatment. [513] At the same time, however, the CABANA

trial (Catheter Ablation versus Anti-arrhythmic Drug Therapy for
Atrial Fibrillation) could not demonstrate a significant difference in mor-­
tality and morbidity between catheter ablation and standard rhythm and/
or rate control drugs in symptomatic AF patients older than 64 years, or
younger than 65 years with risk factors for stroke. [3] EAST-AFNET 4
(Early treatment of Atrial fibrillation for Stroke prevention Trial) re-­
ported that implementation of a rhythm control strategy within 1 year
compared with usual care significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular
death, stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure or acute coronary syn-­
drome in patients older than 75 years or with cardiovascular condi-­
tions. [17] Of note, rhythm control was predominantly pursued with
antiarrhythmic drugs (80% of patients in the intervention arm). Usual
care consisted of rate control therapy; only when uncontrolled
AF-related symptoms occurred was rhythm control considered.

Patients in the EAST-AFNET 4 trial all had cardiovascular risk factors

but were at an early stage of AF, with more than 50% being in sinus
rhythm and 30% being asymptomatic at the start of the study.

Based on all of these studies, this task force concludes that implementa-­
tion of a rhythm control strategy can be safely instituted and confers ameli-­
oration of AF-related symptoms. Beyond control of symptoms, sinus
rhythm maintenance should also be pursued to reduce morbidity and mor-­
tality in selected groups of patients. [4][,][17][,][502][,][513][,][514]

Any rhythm control procedure has an inherent risk of thrombo-­
embolism. Patients undergoing cardioversion require at least 3 weeks
of therapeutic anticoagulation (adherence to DOACs or INR >2 if
VKA) prior to the electrical or pharmacological procedure. In acute set-­
tings or when early cardioversion is needed, transoesophageal echocar-­
diography (TOE) can be performed to exclude cardiac thrombus prior
to cardioversion. These approaches have been tested in multiple
RCTs. [319][–][321] In the case of thrombus detection, therapeutic anticoagu-­
lation should be instituted for a minimum of 4 weeks followed by repeat
TOE to ensure thrombus resolution. When the definite duration of AF
is less than 48 hours, cardioversion has typically been considered with-­
out the need for pre-procedure OAC or TOE for thrombus exclusion.
However, the ‘definite’ onset of AF is often not known, and observa-­
tional data suggest that stroke/thromboembolism risk is lowest within
a much shorter time period. [515][–][519] This task force reached consensus
that safety should come first. Cardioversion is not recommended if AF
duration is longer than 24 hours, unless the patient has already received
at least 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a TOE is performed
to exclude intracardiac thrombus. Most patients should continue OAC
for at least 4 weeks post-cardioversion. Only for those without
thromboembolic risk factors and sinus rhythm restoration within 24
h of AF onset is post-cardioversion OAC optional. In the presence of
any thromboembolic risk factors, long-term OAC should be instituted
irrespective of the rhythm outcome.

**7.2.2. Electrical cardioversion**

Electrical cardioversion (ECV) can be safely applied in the elective and
acute setting (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Additional Evidence*
*[Table S18](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ) with sedation by intravenous midazolam, propofol, or
etomidate. [530] Structured and integrated care for patients with acuteonset AF at the emergency department is associated with better out-­
comes without compromising safety. [531] Rates of major adverse clinical
events after cardioversion are significantly lower with DOACs com-­
pared with warfarin. [293]

Blood pressure monitoring and oximetry should be used routinely.
Intravenous atropine or isoproterenol, or temporary transcutaneous
pacing, should be available in case of post-cardioversion bradycardia.
Biphasic defibrillators are standard because of their superior efficacy
compared with monophasic defibrillators. [532][–][534] There is no single op-­
timal position for electrodes, with a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs showing
no difference in sinus rhythm restoration comparing anterior-posterior
with antero-lateral electrode positioning. [535] Applying active compres-­
sion to the defibrillation pads is associated with lower defibrillation
thresholds, lower total energy delivery, fewer shocks for successful
ECV, and higher success rates. [536] A randomized trial showed that max-­
imum fixed-energy shocks were more effective than low-escalating en-­
ergy for ECV. [537]

Immediate administration of vernakalant, [538] or pre-treatment
for 3–4 days with flecainide, [539][,][540] ibutilide, [541][,][542] propafenone, [543] or
amiodarone [544][–][546] improves the rate of successful ECV and can
facilitate long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm by preventing
early recurrent AF. [547] A meta-analysis demonstrated that pretreatment with amiodarone (200–800 mg/day for 1–6 weeks precardioversion) and post-treatment (200 mg/day) significantly improved
the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm after ECV of AF. [546]

In some cases of persistent AF there is no clear relationship between
the arrhythmia and symptoms. In these cases, restoring sinus rhythm by
ECV might serve to confirm the impact of arrhythmia on symptoms
and/or on heart failure symptoms and signs. Such an approach might
be useful to identify truly asymptomatic individuals, to assess the impact
of AF on LV function in patients with HFrEF, and to distinguish
AF-related symptoms from heart failure symptoms.

rhythm in 76%–83% of patients with recent-onset AF (10%–18% within
the first 3 h, 55%–66% within 24 h, and 69% within 48 h). [10][,][119][,][445][,][551][–][555]

The choice of a specific drug is based on the type and severity of con-­
comitant heart disease ( *Table 13* ). A meta-analysis demonstrated that
intravenous vernakalant and flecainide have the highest conversion rate
within 4 h, possibly allowing discharge from the emergency department
and reducing hospital admissions. Intravenous and oral formulations of
Class IC antiarrhythmics (flecainide more so than propafenone)
are superior regarding conversion rates within 12 h, while amiodarone
efficacy is exhibited in a delayed fashion (within 24 h). [556]

Pharmacological cardioversion does not require fasting, sedation, or an-­
aesthesia. Anticoagulation should be started or continued according to a
formal (re-)assessment of thromboembolic risk. [554][,][557][–][559]

A single self-administered oral dose of flecainide or propafenone
(pill-in-the-pocket) is effective in symptomatic patients with infre-­
quent and recent-onset paroxysmal AF. Safe implementation of this
strategy requires patient screening to exclude sinus node dysfunction,
atrioventricular conduction defects, or Brugada syndrome, as well as
prior in-hospital validation of its efficacy and safety. [560] An atrioven-­
tricular node-blocking drug should be instituted in patients treated
with Class IC AADs to avoid 1:1 conduction if the rhythm transforms
to AFL. [561]

**7.2.4. Antiarrhythmic drugs**
The aims of long-term rhythm control are to maintain sinus rhythm, im-­
prove quality of life, slow the progression of AF, and potentially reduce
morbidity related to AF episodes (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
[Additional Evidence](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Table S19* ). [17][,][445][,][574][,][575] Antiarrhythmic drugs do
not eliminate recurrences of AF, but in patients with paroxysmal
or persistent AF, a recurrence is not equivalent to treatment


failure if episodes are less frequent, briefer, or less symptomatic.
Antiarrhythmic drugs also have a role for long-term rhythm control in
AF patients that are considered ineligible or unwilling to undergo cath-­
eter or surgical ablation.

Before starting AAD treatment, reversible triggers should be identified
and underlying comorbidities treated to reduce the arrhythmogenic sub-­
strate, prevent progression of AF, and facilitate maintenance of sinus

**3358** ESC Guidelines


rhythm. [39][,][128] The RACE 3 trial, including patients with early persistent AF
and mild-to-moderate heart failure (predominantly HFpEF and HFmrEF),
showed that targeted therapy of underlying conditions improved sinus
rhythm maintenance at 1 year (75% vs. 63% as compared with standard
care). [39] The selection of an AAD for long-term rhythm control requires
careful evaluation that takes into account AF type, patient parameters,
and safety profile. [445] It also includes shared decision-making, balancing
the benefit/risk ratio of AADs in comparison with other strategies.
Notably, recent evidence has shown that careful institution of AADs
can be performed safely. [17]

The long-term effectiveness of AADs is limited. In a meta-analysis of
59 RCTs, AADs reduced AF recurrences by 20%–50% compared with
no treatment, placebo, or drugs for rate control. [576][,][577] When one AAD
fails to reduce AF recurrences, a clinically acceptable response may be
achieved with another drug, particularly if from a different class. [578]

Combinations of AADs are not recommended. The data available sug-­
gest that AADs do not produce an appreciable effect on mortality or
other cardiovascular complications with the exception of increased
mortality signals for sotalol [574][,][579][,][580] and amiodarone. [581] In contrast,
use of AADs within a rhythm control strategy can be associated with
reduction of morbidity and mortality in selected patients. [582]

All AADs may produce serious cardiac (proarrhythmia, negative in-­
otropism, hypotension) and extracardiac adverse effects (organ tox-­
icity, predominantly amiodarone). Drug safety, rather than efficacy,
should determine the choice of drug. The risk of proarrhythmia in-­
creases in patients with structural heart disease. Suggested doses for
long-term oral AAD are presented in *Table 13* . [577][,][583][,][584]

**7.2.5. Catheter ablation**

Catheter ablation prevents AF recurrences, reduces AF burden, and
improves quality of life in symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF
where the patient is intolerant or does not respond to AAD. [503][–][509]

Multiple RCTs have provided evidence in favour of catheter ablation
as a first-line approach for rhythm control in patients with paroxysmal
AF, with a similar risk of adverse events as compared with initial AAD
[treatment (see Supplementary data online, Additional Evidence](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Table*
*[S20](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). [15][,][16][,][591][–][594] In contrast, it is not clear whether first-line ablation
is superior to drug therapy in persistent AF. Catheter ablation may
also have a role in patients with symptoms due to prolonged pauses
upon AF termination, where non-randomized data have shown im-­
proved symptoms, and avoidance of pacemaker implantation. [595][–][598]

Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) remains the cornerstone of AF cath-­
eter ablation, [503][,][508][,][593][,][599] but the optimal ablation strategy has not
been clarified in the non-paroxysmal AF population. [600] New technolo-­
gies are emerging, such as pulsed field ablation, in which high-amplitude
electrical pulses are used to ablate the myocardium by electroporation
with high tissue specificity. In a single-blind RCT of 607 patients, pulsed
field ablation was non-inferior for efficacy and safety endpoints com-­
pared with conventional radiofrequency or cryoballoon ablation. [601]

Regarding timing of ablation, a small RCT found that delaying catheter
ablation in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF by 12 months
(while on optimized medical therapy) did not impact on arrhythmiafree survival compared with ablation within 1 month. [602]

As with any type of rhythm control, many patients in clinical practice

will not be suitable for catheter ablation due to factors that reduce the

likelihood of a positive response, such as left atrial dilatation. Definitive
evidence that supports the prognostic benefit of catheter ablation is
needed before this invasive treatment can be considered for truly
asymptomatic patients. As previously noted, the CABANA trial did
not confirm a benefit of catheter ablation compared with medical ther-­
apy, although high crossover rates and low event rates may have diluted
the treatment effect. [3] Therefore, only highly selected asymptomatic pa-­
tients could be candidates for catheter ablation, and only after detailed
discussion of associated risks and potential benefit of delaying AF pro-­
gression. [4][,][603] Randomized trials have shown that AF catheter ablation
in patients with HFrEF significantly reduces arrhythmia recurrence
and increases ejection fraction, with improvement in clinical outcomes
and mortality also observed in selected patients. [4][,][513][,][514][,][604][–][612] Several

characteristics, including but not limited to AF type, left atrial dilatation,
and the presence of atrial and/or ventricular fibrosis, could refine pa-­
tient selection to maximize outcome benefit from AF catheter ablation
in patients with HFrEF. [604][,][608][,][613][–][617] The prognostic value of catheter
ablation in patients with HFpEF is less well established than for
HFrEF. [617][–][626]

Recent registries and trials report varying rates of peri-procedural
serious adverse events associated with catheter ablation (2.9%–7.2%)
with a very low 30 day mortality rate (<0.1%). Operator experience
and procedural volume at the ablation centre are critical, since they
are associated with complication rates and 30 day mortality. [627][–][631]

Intermittent rhythm monitoring has typically been used to detect AF
relapses following catheter ablation. Recent technology developments
such as smartwatch or smartphone photoplethysmography and wear-­
able patches may have an emerging role in post-ablation monitor-­
ing. [632][,][633] In addition, implantable loop recorders have been used to
quantify AF burden before and after ablation as an additional endpoint
beyond binary AF elimination. [634] Management of arrhythmia recur-­
rence post-ablation is an informed, shared decision-making process dri-­
ven by available options for symptom control. In the post-AF ablation
context, there is data supporting a role for AAD continuation or reinitiation, even for previously ineffective drugs. [635] A short-term AAD
treatment (2–3 months) following ablation reduces early recurrences
of AF, [554][,][635][–][639] but does not affect late recurrences [636][,][637][,][640][–][642] or
1 year clinical outcomes. [642] Repeat PVI should be offered in patients
with AF recurrence if symptom improvement was demonstrated after
the first ablation, with shared decision-making and clear goals of treat-­
ment. [643][–][645]

**7.2.6. Anticoagulation in patients undergoing**
**catheter ablation**

The presence of left atrial thrombus is a contraindication to catheterbased AF ablation due to the risk of thrombus dislodgement leading
to ischaemic stroke. Patients planned for catheter ablation of AF with

an increased risk of thromboembolism should be on OAC for at least
3 full weeks prior to the procedure. [554][,][647]

There is a wide range in practice for visualization of intra-atrial
thrombi prior to catheter ablation, including TOE, intracardiac echo-­
cardiography, or delayed phase cardiac computed tomography
(CT). [554][,][648] The prevalence of left atrial thrombus was 1.3% and
2.7% in two meta-analyses of observational studies in patients planned
for catheter ablation of AF on adequate OAC. [649][,][650] The prevalence of
left atrial thrombus was higher in patients with elevated stroke risk
scores, and in patients with non-paroxysmal compared with paroxys-­
mal AF. [650] In addition, several patient subgroups with AF have increased

risk of ischaemic stroke and intracardiac thrombus even if treated with

adequate anticoagulation, including those with cardiac amyloidosis,
rheumatic heart disease, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
Cardiac imaging before catheter ablation should be considered in these
high-risk patient groups regardless of preceding effective OAC.
Observational studies suggest that patients with a low thromboembolic
risk profile may be managed without visualization of the LAA, [651][–][653]

[but no RCTs have been performed (see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
*[Additional Evidence Table S21](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ).

For patients who have been anticoagulated prior to the ablation pro-­
cedure it is recommended to avoid interruption of OAC (see
Supplementary data online, *[Additional Evidence Table S22](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). [654][–][656]

Patients with interrupted OAC showed an increase in silent stroke de-­
tected by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as compared with
those with uninterrupted OAC. [657][–][659] In a true uninterrupted

**3360** ESC Guidelines


DOAC strategy for once-daily dosing, a pre-procedural shift to evening
intake might be considered to mitigate bleeding risk. Randomized trials
show comparable safety and efficacy with minimally interrupted OAC
(withholding the morning DOAC dose on the day of the procedure)
and a totally uninterrupted peri-ablation OAC strategy. [655]

Anticoagulation with heparin during AF ablation is common
practice. [554] Post-ablation DOACs should be continued as per the
dosing regimen when haemostasis has been achieved. [335][,][554][,][647] All
patients should be kept on an OAC for at least 2 months after an
AF ablation procedure irrespective of estimated thromboembolic
risk (see Supplementary data [online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Additional* *Evidence*
*[Table S23](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). [647] Meta-analyses of observational studies have tried to as-­
sess the safety of stopping OAC treatment after catheter ablation for
AF, but the results have been heterogenous. [660][–][663] Until the comple-­
tion of relevant RCTs (e.g. NCT02168829), it is recommended to
continue OAC therapy post-AF ablation according to the patient’s
CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score and not the perceived success of the ablation
procedure. [554]

**7.2.7. Endoscopic and hybrid AF ablation**
Minimally invasive surgical AF ablation can be performed via a thoraco-­
scopic approach or a subxiphoid approach. The term endoscopic cov-­
ers both strategies. Hybrid ablation approaches have been developed
where endoscopic epicardial ablation on the beating heart is performed
in combination with endocardial catheter ablation, either in a simultan-­
eous or sequential procedure. The rationale for combining an endocar-­
dial with an epicardial approach is that a more effective transmural
ablation strategy can be pursued. [666][,][667]

For paroxysmal AF, an endoscopic or hybrid ablation approach may
be considered after a failed percutaneous catheter ablation strat-­
egy. [668][–][670] Long-term follow-up of the FAST RCT (mean of 7.0 years),
which included patients with paroxysmal and persistent AF, found ar-­
rhythmia recurrence was common but substantially lower with thor-­
acoscopic ablation than catheter ablation: 34/61 patients (56%)
compared with 55/63 patients (87%), with *P* < .001 for the compari-­
son. [669] For persistent AF, endoscopic or hybrid ablation approaches
are suitable as a first procedure to maintain long-term sinus rhythm
in selected patients. [667][–][672] A meta-analysis of three RCTs confirmed
a lower rate of atrial arrhythmia recurrence after thoracoscopic vs.
catheter ablation (incidence rate ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38–0.78;
with no heterogeneity between trials). [669] An RCT with 12 month
follow-up published after the meta-analysis in patients with longstanding persistent AF found no difference in arrhythmia freedom
comparing thoracoscopic with catheter ablation. [673] Although overall
morbidity and mortality of both techniques is low, endoscopic and hy-­
brid ablation have higher complication rates than catheter ablation,
but similar long-term rates of the composite of mortality, MI, or
stroke. [667][,][669]

More recent trials have assessed the efficacy and safety of the hybrid
epicardial-plus-endocardial approach in persistent AF refractory to
AAD therapy, including a single-centre RCT [670] and two multicentre
RCTs. [671][,][674] Across these trials, hybrid ablation was consistently super-­
ior to catheter ablation alone for maintaining long-term sinus rhythm,
without significant differences in major adverse events. Notably, these
studies were typically performed in highly experienced centres (see
Supplementary data online, *[Additional Evidence Table S24](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ).

Similar to other rhythm control approaches, this task force recom-­
mends that OAC are continued in all patients who have a risk of
thromboembolism, irrespective of rhythm outcome, and regardless
of LAA exclusion performed as part of the surgical procedure.

**7.2.8. AF ablation during cardiac surgery**
Atrial fibrillation is a significant risk factor for early mortality, late mor-­
tality, and stroke in patients referred for cardiac surgery. [675][–][677] The
best validated method of surgical ablation is the Maze procedure,
consisting of a pattern of transmural lesions including PVI, with
subsequent modifications using bipolar radiofrequency and/or
[cryothermy ablation with LAA amputation (see Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
[online, Additional Evidence](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Table S25* ). [678][–][681] Education and training,
close co-operation within a multidisciplinary team, and shared
decision-making can improve the quality and outcomes of surgical
ablation. [682]

A number of RCTs have shown that surgical AF ablation during
cardiac surgery increases freedom from arrhythmia recur-­
rence. [683][–][688] Performing surgical AF ablation, mainly targeting
those patients needing mitral valve surgery, is not associated with
increased morbidity or mortality. [678][,][683][–][685] Observational data,
including large registries, have supported the potential value of
surgical AF ablation, [689][–][700] but further RCTs are needed to evaluate
which patients should be selected, and whether this approach
contributes to the prevention of stroke, thromboembolism, and

death.

Data on pacemaker implantation rates after surgical AF ablation
are variable and are likely influenced by centre experience and the
patients treated (e.g. underlying sinus node disease). In a systematic
review of 22 RCTs (1726 patients), permanent pacemaker implant-­
ation rates were higher with surgical AF ablation than without con-­
comitant AF surgery (6.0% vs. 4.1%; RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.12–2.54). [701]

Observational registry data from contemporary cohorts (2011–
2020) suggest an overall pacemaker rate post-operatively of 2.1%
in patients selected for surgical AF ablation, with no discernible
impact of surgical ablation on the need for a pacemaker, but
higher rates in those needing multivalve surgery. [702] With a safetyfirst approach in mind, imaging is advised during surgical AF ablation
to exclude thrombus and help to plan the surgical approach
(e.g. with TOE), regardless of effective pre-procedural anticoagulant

use.

**7.2.9. Atrial tachycardia after pulmonary vein**
**isolation**

After any ablation for AF, recurrent arrhythmias may manifest as AF,
but also as atrial tachycardia (AT). Although AT may be perceived as
a step in the right direction by the treating physician, this view is often
not shared by the patient because AT can be equally or more symptom-­
atic than the original AF. Conventionally, an early arrhythmia recur-­
rence post-PVI (whether AT, AF, or flutter) is considered potentially
transitory. [708] Recent trials using continuous implantable loop recorders
for peri-procedural monitoring have provided insight into the incidence
and significance of early arrhythmia recurrences, and have confirmed a
link between early and later recurrence. [709] Discussion of management
options for AT post-ablation should ideally involve a multidisciplinary
team with experience in interventional management of complex ar-­
rhythmias, considering technical challenges, procedural efficacy, and
safety, in the context of patient preferences.
###### **8. [E] Evaluation and dynamic ** **reassessment**

The development and progression of AF results from continuous
interactions between underlying mechanisms (electrical, cellular,
neurohormonal, and haemodynamic), coupled with a broad range of

clinical factors and associated comorbidities. Each individual factor


**3362** ESC Guidelines


has considerable variability over time, affecting its contribution to the
AF-promoting substrate. The risk profile of each patient is also far
from static, and requires a dynamic mode of care to ensure optimal
AF management. [710][,][711] Patients with AF require periodic reassessment
of therapy based on this changing risk status if we are to improve the
overall quality of care. Timely attention to modifiable factors and
underpinning comorbidities has the potential to slow or reverse the
progression of AF, increase quality of life, and prevent adverse out-­
comes such as heart failure, thromboembolism, and major bleeding.

The [E] in AF-CARE encompasses the range of activity needed by
healthcare professionals and patients to: (i) thoroughly evaluate asso-­
ciated comorbidities and risk factors that can guide treatment; and
(ii) provide the dynamic assessment needed to ensure that treatment
plans remain suited to that particular patient. This task force recom-­
mends an adaptive strategy that not only reacts to changes notified
by a patient, but also proactively seeks out issues where altering man-­
agement could impact on patient wellbeing. Avoidance of unnecessary
and costly follow-up is also inherent in this framework, with educated
and empowered patients contributing to identifying the need for access
to specialist care or an escalation of management. The patient-centred,
shared decision philosophy is embedded to improve efficiency in mod-­
els of care and to address the needs of patients with AF.

Medical history and the results of any tests should be regularly reevaluated to address the dynamic nature of comorbidities and risk fac-­
tors. [712] This may have impact on therapeutic decisions; e.g. resumption
of full-dose DOAC therapy after improvement in the patient’s renal
function. The timing of review of the AF-CARE pathway is patient spe-­
cific and should respond to changes in clinical status. In most cases, this
task force advises re-evaluation 6 months after initial presentation, and
then at least annually by a healthcare professional in primary or second-­
ary care (see *Figure 3* ).

**8.1. Implementation of dynamic care**
A multidisciplinary-based approach is advocated to improve implemen-­
tation of dynamic AF-CARE (see *Figure 2* ); although potentially re-­
source intensive, this is preferred to more simplistic or opportunistic
methods. For example, in a pragmatic trial of 47 333 AF patients iden-­
tified through health insurance claims, there was no difference in OAC
initiation at 1 year in those randomized to a single mailout of patient and
clinician education, compared with those in the usual care group. [713] For
co-ordination of care there is a core role for cardiologists, general prac-­
titioners, specialized nurses, and pharmacists. [714] If needed, and depend-­
ing on local resources, others may also be involved (cardiac surgeons,
physiotherapists, neurologists, psychologists, and other allied health
professionals). It is strongly advocated that one core team member coordinates care, and that additional team members become involved ac-­
cording to the needs of the individual patient throughout their AF
trajectory.

Several organizational models of integrated care for AF have been
evaluated, but which components are most useful remains unclear.
Some models include a multidisciplinary team, [715][,][716] while others are
nurse-led [79][,][122][,][124][,][717] or cardiologist-led. [79][,][122][,][124][,][717] Several published
models used computerized decision support systems or electronic
health applications. [79][,][122][,][715][,][718] Evaluation within RCTs has demon-­
strated mixed results due to the variety of methods tested and differ-­
ences in regional care. Several studies report significant improvements
with respect to adherence to anticoagulation, cardiovascular mortality,
and hospitalization relative to standard of care. [121][–][123] However, the


RACE 4 (IntegRAted Chronic Care Program at Specialized AF Clinic
Versus Usual CarE in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation) trial, which in-­
cluded 1375 patients, failed to demonstrate superiority of nurse-led
over usual care. [79] New studies of the components and optimal models
for delivery for integrated care approaches in routine practice are on-­
going (ACTRN12616001109493, NCT03924739).

**8.2. Improving treatment adherence**
Advances in the care of patients with AF can only be effective if appro-­
priate tools are available to support the implementation of the treat-­
ment regimen. [719] A number of factors are related to the optimal
implementation of care at the level of: (i) the individual patient (culture,
cognitive impairment, and psychological status); (ii) the treatment
(complexity, side effects, polypharmacy, impact on daily life, and
cost); (iii) the healthcare system (access to treatment and multidiscip-­
linary approach); and (iv) the healthcare professional (knowledge,
awareness of guidelines, expertise, and communication skills). A collab-­
orative approach to patient care, based upon shared decision-making
and goals tailored to individual patient needs, is crucial in promoting on-­
going patient adherence to the agreed treatment regimen. [720] Even
when treatment seems feasible for the individual, patients often lack ac-­
cess to reliable and up-to-date information about risks and benefits of
various treatment options, and consequently are not empowered to
engage in their own management. A sense of ownership that promotes
the achievement of joint goals can be encouraged through the use of
[educational programmes, websites (such as https://afibmatters.org),](https://afibmatters.org)
app-based tools, and individually tailored treatment protocols which
take into account gender, ethnic, socioeconomic, environmental, and
work factors. In addition, practical tools (e.g. schedules, apps, bro-­
chures, reminders, pillboxes) can help to implement treatment in daily
life. [721][,][722] Regular review by members of the multidisciplinary team en-­
ables the evolution of a flexible and responsive management regimen
that the patient will find easier to follow.

**8.3. Cardiac imaging**

A TTE is a valuable asset across all four AF-CARE domains when

there are changes in the clinical status of an individual patient
( *Figure 13* ). [723][–][725] The key findings to consider from an echocardiogram
are any structural heart disease (e.g. valvular disease or left ventricular
hypertrophy), impairment of left ventricular function (systolic and/or
diastolic to classify heart failure subtype), left atrial dilatation, and right
heart dysfunction. [59][,][67][,][726] To counter irregularity when in AF, obtaining
measurements in cardiac cycles that follow two similar RR intervals can
improve the value of parameters compared with sequential averaging of
cardiac cycles. [723][,][727] Contrast TTE or alternative imaging modalities
may be required where image quality is poor, and quantification of
left ventricular systolic function is needed for decisions on rate or
rhythm control. Other cardiac imaging techniques, such as cardiac mag-­
netic resonance (CMR), CT, TOE, and nuclear imaging can be valuable
when: (i) TTE quality is suboptimal for diagnostic purposes; (ii) addition-­
al information is needed on structure, substrate, or function; and (iii) to
support decisions on interventional procedures (see [Supplementary](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
[data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Figure S1* ). [59][,][724][,][725][,][728] As with TTE, other types of cardiac
imaging can be challenging in the context of AF irregularity or with rapid
heart rate, requiring technique-specific modifications when acquiring
ECG-gated sequences. [729][–][731]

**8.4. Patient-reported outcome measures**
Patients with AF have a lower quality of life compared with the general
population. [732] Improvement in quality of life and functional status should
play a key role in assessing and reassessing treatment decisions (see
[Supplementary data online, Additional Evidence](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Table S26* ). [36]

Patient-reported outcome measures are valuable to measure quality of
life, functional status, symptoms, and treatment burden for patients


with AF over time. [55][,][733][–][735] Patient-reported outcome measures are
playing an increasing role in clinical trials to assess the success of treat-­
ment; however, they remain under-utilized. [736][,][737] They can be divided
into generic or disease-specific tools, with the latter helping to provide
insight into AF-related impacts. [738] However, multimorbidity can still con-­
found the sensitivity of all PROMs, impacting on association with other
established metrics of treatment performance such as mEHRA symptom

class and natriuretic peptides. [48] Intervention studies have demonstrated
an association between improvement in PROM scores and reduction in
AF burden and symptoms. [48][,][738]

Atrial fibrillation-specific questionnaires include the AF 6 (AF6), [739]

Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT), [740] the Atrial
Fibrillation Quality of Life Questionnaire (AFQLQ), [741] the Atrial
Fibrillation Quality of Life (AF-QoL), [742] and the Quality of Life in
Atrial Fibrillation (QLAF). [743] The measurement properties of most of
these tools lack sufficient validation. [49] The International Consortium
for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) working group recom-­
mends the use of the AFEQT PROM or a symptom questionnaire called
the Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS) for measuring exercise tol-­
erance and the impact of symptoms in AF. [744] Through wider use of pa-­
tient experience measures, there is an opportunity at the institutional
level to improve the quality of care delivered to patients with AF. [49][–][55]

###### **9. The AF-CARE pathway in specific ** **clinical settings**

The following sections detail specific clinical settings where approaches
to AF-CARE may vary. Unless specially discussed, measures for [C] co-­
morbidity and risk factor management, [A] avoidance of stroke and
thromboembolism, [R] rate and rhythm control, and [E] evaluation
and dynamic reassessment should follow the standard pathways intro-­
duced in *Section 4* .

**9.1. AF-CARE in unstable patients**
Unstable patients with AF include those with haemodynamic instability
caused by the arrhythmia or acute cardiac conditions, and severely ill
patients who develop AF (sepsis, trauma, surgery, and particularly
cancer-related surgery). Conditions such as sepsis, adrenergic over-­
stimulation, and electrolyte disturbances contribute to onset and recur-­
rence of AF in these patients. Spontaneous restoration of sinus rhythm
has been reported in up to 83% during the first 48 h after appropriate
treatment of the underlying cause. [551][,][745]

Emergency electrical cardioversion is still considered the first-choice
treatment if sinus rhythm is thought to be beneficial, despite the limita-­
tion of having a high rate of immediate relapse. [746] Amiodarone is a
second-line option because of its delayed activity; however, it may be
an appropriate alternative in the acute setting. [747][,][748] In a multicentre co-­
hort study carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States of
America, amiodarone and beta-blockers were similarly effective for


rate control in intensive care patients, and superior to digoxin and cal-­
cium channel blockers. [749] The ultra-short acting and highly selective betablocker landiolol can safely control rapid AF in patients with low ejection
fraction and acutely decompensated heart failure, with a limited impact
on myocardial contractility or blood pressure. [477][,][750][,][751]

**9.2. AF-CARE in acute and chronic**

**coronary syndromes**
The incidence of AF in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) ranges from
2% to 23%. [752] The risk of new-onset AF is increased by 60%–77% in
patients suffering an MI, [753] and AF may be associated with an increased
risk of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or
non-STEMI ACS. [754] Overall, 10%–15% of AF patients undergo percu-­
taneous intervention (PCI) for CAD. [755] In addition, AF is a common
precipitant for type 2 MI. [756] Observational studies show that patients
with both ACS and AF are less likely to receive appropriate antithrom-­
botic therapy [757] and more likely to experience adverse outcomes. [758]

Peri-procedural management of patients with ACS or chronic coronary
syndromes (CCS) are detailed in the *2023 ESC Guidelines for the man-­*
*agement of acute coronary syndromes* and *2024 ESC Guidelines for the*
*management of chronic coronary syndromes* . [759][,][760]

The combination of AF with ACS is the area where use of multiple
antithrombotic drugs is most frequently indicated, consisting of antiplate-­
let agents plus OAC ( *Figure 14* ) (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
*[Additional Evidence Table S27](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). There is a general trend to decrease the
duration of DAPT to reduce bleeding; however, this may increase ischae-­
mic events and stent thrombosis. [761][,][762] In ACS there is a high risk of pre-­
dominantly platelet-driven atherothrombosis and thus of coronary
ischaemic events. Acute coronary syndromes treated by PCI require
DAPT for improved short- and long-term prognosis. Therefore, a periprocedural triple antithrombotic regimen including an OAC, aspirin, and
a P2Y 12 inhibitor should be the default strategy for most patients. Major
thrombotic events vs. major bleeding risk need to be balanced when pre-­
scribing antiplatelet therapy and OAC after the acute phase and/or after
PCI. The combination of OAC (preferably a DOAC) and a P2Y 12 inhibi-­
tor results in less major bleeding than triple therapy that includes aspirin.
Clopidogrel is the preferred P2Y 12 inhibitor, as the evidence for ticagre-­
lor and prasugrel is less clear with higher bleeding risk. [763][–][769] Ongoing
trials will add to our knowledge about safely combining DOACs with
antiplatelet agents (NCT04981041, NCT04436978). When using
VKAs with antiplatelet agents, there is consensus opinion to use an
INR range of 2.0–2.5 to mitigate excess bleeding risk.

Short–term triple therapy (≤1 week) is recommended for all pa-­
tients without diabetes after ACS or PCI. In pooled analyses of
RCTs, omitting aspirin in patients with ACS undergoing PCI has
the potential for higher rates of ischaemic/stent thrombosis, without
impact on incident stroke. [761][,][762][,][770][–][772] None of the trials were
powered for ischaemic events. All patients in AUGUSTUS (an open–
label, 2 × 2 factorial, randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate
the safety of apixaban vs. vitamin k antagonist and aspirin vs. aspirin pla-­
cebo in patients with AF and ACS or PCI) received aspirin plus a P2Y 12
inhibitor for a median time of 6 days. [773] At the end of the trial, apixaban
and a P2Y 12 inhibitor without aspirin was the optimal treatment regi-­
men for most patients with AF and ACS and/or PCI, irrespective of
the patient’s baseline bleeding and stroke risk. [774][,][775]

ESC Guidelines **3365**


Prolonged triple therapy up to 1 month after ACS/PCI should
be considered in patients at high ischaemic risk, e.g. STEMI,
prior stent thrombosis, complex coronary procedures, and pro-­
longed cardiac instability, even though these patients were not
adequately represented in the RCTs so far available. [776] In AF


patients with ACS or CCS and diabetes mellitus undergoing
coronary stent implantation, prolonging triple therapy with lowdose aspirin, clopidogrel, and an OAC up to 3 months may be
of benefit if thrombotic risk outweighs bleeding risk in the individ-­
ual patient. [207]

VKA, vitamin K antagonist. The flowchart applies to those patients with an indication for oral anticoagulant therapy. [a] The full standard dose of
DOACs should be used unless the patient fulfils dose-reduction criteria ( *Table 11* ). When rivaroxaban or dabigatran are used as the DOAC and con-­
cerns about bleeding risk prevail over stent thrombosis or ischaemic stroke, the reduced dose should be considered (15 mg and 110 mg respectively;
Class IIa). [b] In patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing coronary stent implantation, prolonging triple antithrombotic therapy for up to 3 months may
be of value if thrombotic risk outweighs the bleeding risk.

**3366** ESC Guidelines


The evidence for ACS treated without revascularization is

limited. Six to 12 months of a single antiplatelet agent in addition to a
long-term DOAC is usually sufficient and can minimize bleeding
risk. [760][,][764][,][774] Although there are no head-to-head comparisons be-­
tween aspirin and clopidogrel, studies have typically used clopidogrel.
In patients with stable CCS for more than 12 months, sole
therapy with a DOAC is sufficient and no additional antiplatelet therapy
is required. [353] In patients at potential risk of gastrointestinal bleeding,
use of proton pump inhibitors is reasonable during combined
antithrombotic therapy, although evidence in AF patients is
limited. [437][,][777][–][779] Multimorbid patients with ACS or CCS need careful
assessment of ischaemic risk and management of modifiable bleeding
risk factors, with a comprehensive work-up to individually adapt
antithrombotic therapy.

**9.3. AF-CARE in vascular disease**

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is common in patients with AF, ran-­
ging from 6.7% to 14% of patients. [783][,][784] Manifest PAD is associated
with incident AF. [785] PAD predicts a higher mortality in patients with
AF and is an independent predictor of stroke in those not on
OAC. [783][,][786] Patients with lower extremity artery disease and AF
also have a higher overall mortality and risk of major cardiac
events. [784][,][787][,][788] A public health database of >40 000 patients
hospitalized for PAD or critical limb ischaemia showed AF to be an
independent predictor for mortality (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.39–1.52)
and ischaemic stroke (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.44–1.85) as compared
with propensity-matched controls. [784] Similarly, in patients undergoing
carotid endarterectomy or stenting, the presence of AF is associated
with higher mortality (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.11–2.26). [789]

Anticoagulation alone is usually sufficient in the chronic disease
phase, with DOACs being the preferred agents despite one RCT sub-­
analysis showing a higher risk of bleeding as compared with warfarin. [790]

In the case of recent endovascular revascularization, a period of com-­
bination with single antiplatelet therapy should be considered, weighing
bleeding and thrombotic risks and keeping the period of combination
antithrombotic therapy as brief as possible (ranging between 1 month
for peripheral [791] and 90 days for neuro-interventional procedures). [792]

**9.4. AF-CARE in acute stroke or**

**intracranial haemorrhage**
**9.4.1. Management of acute ischaemic stroke**

Management of acute stroke in patients with AF is beyond the scope of
these guidelines. In AF patients presenting with acute ischaemic stroke
while taking OAC, acute therapy depends on the treatment regimen
and intensity of OAC. Management should be co-ordinated by a spe-­
cialist neurologist team according to relevant guidelines. [793]

ESC Guidelines **3367**


**9.4.2. Introduction or re-introduction of**

**anticoagulation after ischaemic stroke**
The optimal time for administering OAC in patients with acute cardio-­
embolic stroke and AF remains unclear. Randomized control trials have

been unable to provide any evidence to support the administration of
anticoagulants or heparin in patients with acute ischaemic stroke within
48 h from stroke onset. This suggests that low-dose aspirin should be
administered to all patients during this timeframe. [794]

Two trials have examined the use of DOAC therapy early after
stroke, with no difference in clinical outcomes compared with delayed
DOAC prescription. The ELAN (Early versus Late initiation of direct
oral Anticoagulants in post-ischaemic stroke patients with atrial
fibrillatioN) trial randomized 2013 patients with acute ischaemic stroke
and AF to open-label early use of DOACs (<48 h after minor/moderate
stroke; day 6–7 after major stroke) vs. later DOAC prescription (day
3–4 after minor stroke; day 6–7 after moderate stroke; day 12–14 after
major stroke). There was no significant difference in the composite
thromboembolic, bleeding, and vascular death outcome at 30 days
(risk difference early vs. late, −1.18%; 95% CI, −2.84 to 0.47). [795] The
TIMING (Timing of Oral Anticoagulant Therapy in Acute Ischemic
Stroke With Atrial Fibrillation) trial, a registry-based, non-inferiority,
open-label, blinded endpoint trial randomized 888 patients within
72 h of ischaemic stroke onset to early (≤4 days) or delayed (5–10 days)
DOAC initiation. Early DOAC use was non-inferior to the delayed
strategy for the composite of thromboembolism, bleeding and all-cause
mortality at 90 days (risk difference, −1.79%; 95% CI, −5.31% to
1.74%). [796] Two ongoing trials will provide further guidance on the
most appropriate timing of DOAC therapy after ischaemic stroke
(NCT03759938, NCT03021928).

**9.4.3. Introduction or re-introduction of**

**anticoagulation after haemorrhagic stroke**
There is insufficient evidence currently to recommend whether OAC
should be started or re-started after ICH to protect against the high
risk of ischaemic stroke in these patients (see [Supplementary data](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
online, *[Additional Evidence Table S28](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). Data from two pilot trials are avail-­
able. The APACHE-AF (Apixaban After Anticoagulation-associated
Intracerebral Haemorrhage in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) trial
was a prospective, randomized, open-label trial with masked endpoint as-­
sessment; 101 patients who survived 7–90 days after anticoagulationassociated ICH were randomized to apixaban or no OAC. During a
median of 1.9 years follow-up (222 person-years), there was no differ-­
ence in non-fatal stroke or vascular death, with an annual event rate of
12.6% with apixaban and 11.9% with no OAC (adjusted HR, 1.05; 95%
CI, 0.48–2.31; *P* = .90). [797] SoSTART (Start or STop Anticoagulants
Randomised Trial) was an open-label RCT in 203 patients with AF after
symptomatic spontaneous ICH. Starting OAC was not non-inferior to
avoiding long-term (≥1 year) OAC, with ICH recurrence in 8/101
(8%) vs. 4/102 (4%) patients (adjusted HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 0.72–8.09).
Mortality occurred in 22/101 (22%) patients in the OAC group vs.
11/102 (11%) patients where OAC were avoided. [798]

Until additional trials report on the clinical challenge of post-ICH an-­
ticoagulation (NCT03950076, NCT03996772), an individualized multi-­
disciplinary approach is advised led by an expert neurology team.

**9.5. AF-CARE for trigger-induced AF**
Trigger-induced AF is defined as new AF in the immediate association of a
precipitating and potentially reversible factor. Also known as ‘secondary’
AF, this task force prefer the term trigger-induced as there are almost


always underlying factors in individual patients that can benefit from full
consideration of the AF-CARE pathway. The most common precipitant
unmasking a tendency to AF is acute sepsis, where AF prevalence is

between 9% and 20% and has been associated with a worse
prognosis. [11][–][14] The degree of inflammation correlates with the incidence
of AF, [799] which may partly explain the wide variability across studies in
prevalence, as well as recurrence of AF. Longer-term data suggest that
AF triggered by sepsis recurs after discharge in between a third to a half
of patients. [12][,][800][–][807] In addition to other acute triggers which may be causal
(such as alcohol [808][,][809] and illicit drug use [810] ), numerous conditions are also
associated with chronic inflammation leading to subacute stimuli for AF
( *Table 14* ). The specific trigger of an operative procedure is discussed in
*Section 9.6* .

After meeting the diagnostic criteria for AF (see *Section* *3.2* ), the
management of trigger-induced AF is recommended to follow the
AF-CARE principles, with critical consideration of underlying risk factors
and comorbidities. Based on retrospective and observational data, patients
with AF and trigger-induced AF seem to carry the same thromboembolic
risk as patients with primary AF. [811][,][812] In the acute phase of sepsis, patients
show an unclear risk–benefit profile with anticoagulation therapy. [813][,][814]

Prospective studies on anticoagulation in patients with triggered AF epi-­
sodes are lacking. [802][,][812][,][815] Acknowledging that there are no RCTs specif-­
ically available in this population to assess trigger-induced AF, long-term
OAC therapy should be considered in suitable patients with triggerinduced AF who are at elevated risk of thromboembolism, starting
OAC after the acute trigger has been corrected and considering the antici-­
pated net clinical benefit and informed patient preferences. As with any de-­
cision on OAC, not all patients will be suitable for OAC, depending on
relative and absolute contraindications and the risk of major bleeding.
The approach to rate and rhythm control will depend on subsequent re-­
currence of AF or any associated symptoms, and re-evaluation should be
individualized to take account of the often high AF recurrence rate.

**9.6. AF-CARE in post-operative patients**
Peri-operative AF describes the onset of the arrhythmia during an
ongoing intervention. Post-operative AF (POAF), defined as newonset AF in the immediate post-operative period, is a common com-­
plication with clinical impact that occurs in 30%–50% of patients
undergoing cardiac surgery, [816][–][818] and in 5%–30% of patients under-­
going non-cardiac surgery. Intra- and post-operative changes and
specific AF triggers (including peri-operative complications) and
pre-existing AF-related risk factors and comorbidities increase the
susceptibility to POAF. [819] Although POAF episodes may be selfterminating, POAF is associated with 4–5 times increase in recurrent
AF during the next 5 years, [820][,][821] and is a risk factor for stroke, MI,
heart failure, and death. [822][–][827] Other adverse events associated

with POAF include haemodynamic instability, prolonged hospital
stay, infections, renal complications, bleeding, increased in-hospital
death, and greater healthcare cost. [828][–][830]

While multiple strategies to prevent POAF with pre-treatment or acute
drug treatment have been described, there is a lack of evidence from large
RCTs. Pre-operative use of propranolol or carvedilol plus *N* -acetyl
cysteine in cardiac and non-cardiac surgery is associated with a reduced
incidence of POAF, [831][–][834] but not major adverse events. [835] An umbrella
review of 89 RCTs from 23 meta-analyses (19 211 patients, but not neces-­
sarily in AF) showed no benefit from beta-blockers in cardiac surgery for
mortality, MI, or stroke. In non-cardiac surgery, beta-blockers were asso-­
ciated with reduced rates of MI after surgery (RR range, 0.08–0.92), but
higher mortality (RR range, 1.03–1.31), and increased risk of stroke (RR
range, 1.33–7.72). [836] Prevention of peri-operative AF can also be achieved
with amiodarone. In a meta-analyses, amiodarone (oral or intravenous

[i.v.]) and beta-blockers were equally effective in reducing post-operative
AF, [837] but their combination was better than beta-blockers alone. [838]

Lower cumulative doses of amiodarone (<3000 mg during the
loading phase) could be effective, with fewer adverse events. [837][,][839][,][840]

Withdrawal of beta-blockers should be avoided due to increased risk
of POAF. [841] Other treatment strategies (steroids, magnesium, sotalol,
(bi)atrial pacing, and botulium injection into the epicardial fat pad) lack
scientific evidence for the prevention of peri-operative AF. [842][,][843]

Peri-operative posterior pericardiotomy, due to the reduction of postoperative pericardial effusion, showed a significant decrease in POAF
in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27–0.70;
*P* = .0005). [844][–][846] In 3209 patients undergoing non-cardiac thoracic sur-­
gery, colchicine did not lead to any significant reduction in AF compared
with placebo (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.65–1.10; *P* = .22). [847]

The evidence for prevention of ischaemic stroke in POAF by OAC
is limited. [822][,][827] Oral anticoagulant therapy is associated with a high


bleeding risk soon after cardiac surgery or major non-cardiac inter-­
ventions. [827] Conversely, meta-analyses of observational cohort stud-­
ies suggest a possible protective impact of OAC in POAF for all-cause
mortality [848] and a lower risk of thromboembolic events following car-­
diac surgery, accompanied by higher rates of bleeding. [849] This task
force recommends to treat post-operative AF according to the
AF-CARE pathway as discussed for trigger-induced AF (with the [R]
pathway the same as for first-diagnosed AF). Ongoing RCTs in cardiac
surgery (NCT04045665) and non-cardiac surgery (NCT03968393)
will inform optimal long-term OAC use among patients with POAF.
While awaiting the results of these trials, this task force recommends
that after acute bleeding risk has settled, long-term OAC should be
considered in patients with POAF according to their thromboembolic

risk factors.

**9.7. AF-CARE in embolic stroke of**

**unknown source**

The term ‘embolic stroke of undetermined source’ (ESUS) was introduced
to identify non-lacunar strokes whose mechanism is likely to be embolic,
but the source remains unidentified. [856] Of note, these patients have a re-­
current risk of stroke of 4%–5% per year. [856] The main embolic sources as-­
sociated with ESUS are concealed AF, atrial cardiomyopathy, left
ventricular disease, atherosclerotic plaques, patent foramen ovale (PFO),
valvular diseases, and cancer. Atrial cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dis-­
ease are the most prevalent causes. [856] AF is reported to be the underlying
mechanism in 30% of ESUS patients. [857][–][859] The detection of AF among
ESUS patients increases the longer cardiac monitoring is provided (see
Supplementary data online, *[Additional Evidence Table S29](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). [857][,][860][–][864] This
also holds for the duration of implantable cardiac monitoring, with prob-­
ability of AF detection ranging from 2% with 1 week to over 20% by 3
years. [865] In patients with ESUS, factors associated with an increased detec-­
tion of AF are increasing age, [866][,][867] left atrial enlargement, [866] cortical loca-­
tion of stroke, [868] large or small vessel disease, [863] an increased number of

atrial premature beats per 24 h, [868] rhythm irregularity, [859] and risk stratifi-­
cation scores (such as CHA 2 DS 2- VASc, [869] Brown ESUS-AF, [870]

HAVOC, [871] and C 2 HEST [872] ). This task force recommends prolonged
monitoring depending on the presence of the above-mentioned risk
markers. [865][,][873][,][874]

Currently available evidence, including two completed RCTs and one
stopped for futility, do not support the use of DOACs compared with
aspirin in patients with acute ESUS without documented AF. [875][–][877]

Ongoing trials will provide further guidance (NCT05134454,
NCT05293080, NCT04371055).

(verapamil should be avoided in the first trimester). Rhythm control is
the preferred strategy during pregnancy. Electrical cardioversion is re-­
commended if there is haemodynamic instability, considerable risk to
mother or foetus, or with concomitant HCM. Electrical cardioversion
can be performed safely without compromising foetal blood flow,
and the consequent risk for foetal arrhythmias or pre-term labour is
low. The foetal heart rate should be closely monitored throughout
and after cardioversion, which should generally be preceded by anticoa-­
gulation. [885] In haemodynamically stable women without structural
heart disease, intravenous ibutilide or flecainide may be considered
for termination of AF, but experience is limited. [890] Catheter ablation
is normally avoided during pregnancy, [883] but is technically feasible with-­
out radiation in refractory symptomatic cases with a minimal/zero
fluoroscopy approach. [883]

Counselling is important in women of childbearing potential prior to
pregnancy, highlighting the potential risks of anticoagulation and rate or
rhythm control drugs (including teratogenic risk, where relevant).
Contraception and timely switch to safe drugs should be proactively

discussed.

**9.8. AF-CARE during pregnancy**
Atrial fibrillation is one of the most common arrhythmias during preg-­
nancy, with prevalence increasing due to higher maternal age and
changes in lifestyle, and because more women with congenital heart dis-­
ease survive to childbearing age. [878][–][881] Rapid atrioventricular conduc-­
tion of AF may have serious haemodynamic consequences for
mother and foetus. AF during pregnancy is associated with an increased
risk of death. [882] A multidisciplinary approach is essential to prevent ma-­
ternal and foetal complications, bringing together gynaecologists, neo-­
natologists, anaesthesiologists, and cardiologists experienced in
maternal medicine. [883]

Pregnancy is associated with a hypercoagulable state and increased
thromboembolic risk. [884] The same rules for risk assessment of

thromboembolism should be used as in non-pregnant women, as de-­
tailed in the *2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular*
*diseases during pregnancy* . [885] The preferred agents for anticoagulation
of AF during pregnancy are unfractionated or low molecular weight he-­
parins (LMWHs), which do not cross the placenta. Vitamin K antago-­
nists should be avoided in the first trimester (risk of miscarriage,
teratogenicity) and from week 36 onwards (risk of foetal intracranial
bleeding if early unexpected delivery). Direct oral anticoagulants are
not recommended during pregnancy due to concerns about safety. [886]

However, an accidental exposure during pregnancy should not lead to a
recommendation for termination of the pregnancy. [887] Vaginal delivery
should be advised for most women, but is contraindicated during VKA
treatment because of the risk of foetal intracranial bleeding. [885]

Intravenous selective beta-1 receptor blockers are recommended as
first choice for acute heart rate control of AF. [888] This does not include
atenolol, which can lead to intrauterine growth retardation. [889] If betablockers fail, digoxin and verapamil can be considered for rate control

**9.9. AF-CARE in congenital heart disease**
Survival of patients with congenital heart disease has increased over
time, but robust data on the management of AF are missing and avail-­
able evidence is derived mainly from observational studies. Oral anti-­
coagulants are recommended for all patients with AF and intracardiac
repair, cyanotic congenital heart disease, Fontan palliation, or systemic
right ventricle irrespective of the individuals’ thromboembolic risk
factors. [897] Patients with AF and other congenital heart diseases should
follow the general risk stratification for OAC use in AF (i.e. depending
on the thromboembolic risk or CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score). Direct oral
anticoagulants are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart
valves, [331] but appear safe in patients with congenital heart dis-­
ease, [898][,][899] or those with a valvular bioprosthesis. [900][,][901]

Rate control drugs such as selective beta-1 receptor blockers,
verapamil, diltiazem, and digoxin can be used with caution, with moni-­
toring for bradycardia and hypotension. Rhythm control strategies such
as amiodarone may be effective, but warrant monitoring for bradycar-­
dia. When cardioversion is planned, both 3 weeks of OAC and TOE
should be considered because thrombi are common in patients with
congenital heart disease and atrial arrhythmias. [902][,][903] Ablation ap-­
proaches can be successful in patients with congenital heart disease,
[but AF recurrence rates may be high (see Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
*[Additional Evidence Table S30](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ).

In patients with atrial septal defect, closure may be performed be-­
fore the fourth decade of life to decrease the risk of AF or AFL. [904]

Patients with stroke who underwent closure of their PFO may have
an increased risk of AF, [905] but in patients with PFO and AF, PFO clos-­
ure is not recommended for stroke prevention. AF surgery or cath-­
eter ablation can be considered at the time of closure of the atrial
septal defect within a multidisciplinary team. [906][–][908] AF catheter
ablation of late atrial arrhythmias is likely to be effective after surgical
atrial septal closure. [909]

**9.10. AF-CARE in endocrine disorders**

Endocrine dysfunction is closely related to AF, both as the direct action
of endocrine hormones and as a consequence of treatments for endo-­
crine disease. Optimal management of endocrine disorders is therefore
part of the AF-CARE pathway. [910][,][911]

Clinical and subclinical hyperthyroidism, as well as subclinical hypo-­
thyroidism, are associated with an increased risk of AF. [912][,][913] Patients
presenting with new-onset or recurrent AF should be tested for
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. The risk of AF is enhanced


in vulnerable patients, including the elderly and those with structural
atrial diseases, [914][,][915] as well as cancer patients on immune checkpoint
inhibitors. [916][,][917] In hyperthyroidism, and even in the euthyroid range,
the risk of AF increases according to the reduction in TSH and elevated
levels of thyroxine. [918][,][919] Moreover, the risk of stroke is higher in
patients with hyperthyroidism, which can be mitigated by treating the
thyroid disorder. [920][,][921] Amiodarone induces thyroid dysfunction in
15%–20% of treated patients, leading to both hypo- and hyperthyroid-­
ism, [922][,][923] which warrants referral to an endocrinologist (see
[Supplementary data online for further details).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)

Hypercalcaemia may also induce arrhythmias, but the role of primary
hyperparathyroidism in incident AF is poorly studied. Surgical para-­
thyroidectomy has been found to reduce both supraventricular and ven-­
tricular premature beats. [924][–][926] Primary aldosteronism is related to an
increased risk of AF through direct actions and vascular effects, [927][,][928]

with a three-fold higher rate of incident AF compared with patients
with essential hypertension. [929] Increases in genetically predicted plasma
cortisol are associated with greater risk of AF, and patients with adrenal
incidentalomas with subclinical cortisol secretion have a higher preva-­
lence of AF. [930][,][931] Acromegaly may predispose to an increased sub-­
strate for AF, with incident AF rates significantly higher than controls
in long-term follow-up, even after adjusting for AF risk factors. [932]

The association between type 2 diabetes and AF is discussed in
*Sections 5.3* (AF recurrence) and *Section 10.5* (incident AF). In addition
to insulin-resistance mechanisms typical of type 2 diabetes, the loss of
insulin signalling has recently been associated with electrical changes
that can lead to AF. Type 1 diabetes is associated with an increased
risk of several cardiovascular diseases including AF. [933][–][937]

**9.11. AF-CARE in inherited**

**cardiomyopathies and primary**
**arrhythmia syndromes**
A higher incidence and prevalence of AF have been described in pa-­
tients with inherited cardiomyopathies and primary arrhythmia syn-­
dromes. [271][,][938][–][970] AF can be the presenting or only clinically overt
feature. [969][,][971][–][975] AF in these patients is associated with adverse clinical
outcomes, [947][,][954][,][959][,][963][,][965][,][976][–][978] and has important implications on
management (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Additional Evidence*
*[Table S31](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). When AF presents at a young age, there should be a careful
interrogation about family history and a search for underlying
disease. [979]

Rhythm control approaches may be challenging in patients with inher-­
ited cardiomyopathies and primary arrhythmia syndromes. For example,
many drugs have a higher risk of adverse events or may be contraindicated
(e.g. amiodarone and sotalol in congenital long QT syndrome, and Class IC
[AADs in Brugada syndrome) (see Supplementary Data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Table S6* ).
Owing to long-term adverse effects, chronic use of amiodarone is prob-­
lematic in these typically young individuals. In patients with an implantable
cardioverter defibrillator, AF is a common cause of inappropriate
shocks. [959][,][966][,][980][,][981] Programming a single high-rate ventricular fibrillation
zone ≥210–220 b.p.m. with long detection time is safe, [950][,][953][,][982] and is
suggested in patients without documented slow monomorphic ventricu-­
lar tachycardia. Implantation of an atrial lead may be considered in the case
of significant bradycardia with beta-blocker treatment.

Patients with Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome and AF are at risk
of fast ventricular rates from rapid conduction of atrial electrical activity
to the ventricles via the accessory pathway, potentially leading to ven-­
tricular fibrillation and sudden death. [983][,][984] Immediate electrical cardi-­
oversion is needed for haemodynamically compromised patients with

ESC Guidelines **3371**


pre-excited AF, and atrioventricular node-modulating drugs should be
avoided. [985][,][986] Pharmacological cardioversion can be attempted using
ibutilide [987] or flecainide, while propafenone should be used with cau-­
tion due to effects on the atrioventricular node. [988][,][989] Amiodarone

should be avoided in pre-excited AF due to its delayed action.
Further details on inherited cardiomyopathies can be found in the
*2023 ESC Guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies* . [990]

**9.12. AF-CARE in cancer**

All types of cancer show an increased risk of AF, with prevalence vary-­
ing from 2% to 28%. [991][–][995] The occurrence of AF may often be related
to a pre-existing atrial substrate with vulnerability to AF. AF may be an
indicator of an occult cancer, but also can appear in the context of con-­
comitant surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. [916][,][994][,][996] Risk of AF
is dependent on, among other factors, the cancer type and stage, [997] and
is greater in older patients with pre-existing cardiovascular dis-­
ease. [991][,][993][,][994] Some procedures are associated with higher incidence
of AF, including lung surgery (from 6% to 32%) and non-thoracic sur-­
gery such as a colectomy (4%–5%). [994]

Atrial fibrillation in the context of cancer is associated with a twofold higher risk of systemic thromboembolism and stroke, and six-fold
increased risk of heart failure. [991][,][994] On the other hand, the coexistence

of cancer increases the risk of all-cause mortality and major bleeding in
patients with AF. [998] Bleeding in those receiving OAC can also unmask
the presence of cancer. [999]

Stroke risk scores may underestimate thromboembolic risk in cancer
patients. [1000] The association between cancer, AF, and ischaemic stroke
also differs between cancer types. In some types of cancer, the risk of
bleeding seems to exceed the risk of thromboembolism. [998] Risk strati-­
fication is therefore complex in this population, and should be per-­
formed on an individual basis considering cancer type, stage,
prognosis, bleeding risk, and other risk factors. These aspects can
change within a short period of time, requiring dynamic assessment
and management.

As with non-cancer patients, DOACs in those with cancer have simi-­
lar efficacy and better safety compared with VKAs. [1001][–][1010] Low
molecular weight heparin is a short-term anticoagulation option, mostly
during some cancer treatments, recent active bleeding, or thrombo-­
cytopaenia. [1011] Decision-making on AF management, including on
rhythm control, is best performed within a cardio-oncology multi-­
disciplinary team. [916][,][1012] Attention is required on interactions with can-­
cer treatments, in particular QT-interval prolongation with AADs.

**9.13. AF-CARE in older, multimorbid, or**
**frail patients**
Atrial fibrillation increases with age, and older patients more frequently
have multimorbidity and frailty which are associated with worse clinical
outcomes. [1013][–][1016] Multimorbidity is the coexistence of two or more
medically diagnosed diseases in the same individual. Frailty is defined
as a person more vulnerable and less able to respond to a stressor
or acute event, increasing the risk of adverse outcomes. [1016][,][1017] The
prevalence of frailty in AF varies due to different methods of assess-­
ment from 4.4% to 75.4%, and AF prevalence in the frail population
ranges from 48.2% to 75.4%. [1018] Frailty status is a strong independent
risk factor for new-onset AF among older adults with hypertension. [1019]

Atrial fibrillation in frail patients is associated with less use of
OAC and lower rates of management with a rhythm control
strategy. [1015][,][1018][,][1020] Oral anticoagulation initiation in older, frail


multimorbid AF patients has improved since the introduction of
DOACs, but is still lower in AF patients at older age (OR, 0.98 per
year; 95% CI, 0.98–0.98), with dementia (OR, 0.57; 95% CI,
0.55–0.58), or frailty (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.72–0.76). [1021] The value of
observational data which show potential benefit from OAC (in particu-­
lar, DOACs) is limited due to prescription biases. [1022][–][1027] Frail patients
aged ≥75 years with polypharmacy and stable on a VKA may remain on
the VKA rather than switching to a DOAC ( *Section 6.2* ). [309]

**9.14. AF-CARE in atrial flutter**
Due to the association between AFL and thromboembolic outcomes,
and the frequent development of AF in patients with AFL, the manage-­
ment of comorbidities and risk factors in AFL should mirror that for AF

(see *Section 5* ). Similarly, the approach to prevent thromboembolism in
AFL includes peri-procedural and long-term OAC (see *Section 6* ). Rate
control can be difficult to achieve in AFL, despite combination therapy.
Rhythm control is often the first-line approach, [983] with small rando-­
mized trials showing that cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) ablation is super-­
ior to AADs. [1028][,][1029] Recurrence of AFL is uncommon after achieving
and confirming bidirectional block in typical CTI-dependent AFL.
However, the majority of patients (50%–70%) have manifested AF
during long-term follow-up in observational studies after AFL
ablation. [1030][,][1031] Hence the necessity for long-term dynamic reevaluation in all patients with AFL in keeping with the AF-CARE
approach. More detail on the management of AFL and other atrial ar-­
rhythmias is described in the *2019 ESC Guidelines for the management of*
*patients with supraventricular tachycardia* . [983]

###### **10. Screening and prevention of AF**

**10.1. Epidemiology of AF**
Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia worldwide,
with an estimated global prevalence in 2019 of 59.7 million persons
with AF. [1033] Incident cases of AF are doubling every few decades. [1034]

Future increases are anticipated, in particular in middle-income coun-­
tries. [1034] In community-based individuals, the prevalence of AF in a
United States of America cohort was up to 5.9%. [1035] The
age-standardized prevalence and incidence rates have remained con-­
stant over time. [1033][,][1036] The increase in overall prevalence is largely at-­
tributable to population growth, ageing, and survival from other cardiac
conditions. In parallel, increases in risk factor burden, better awareness,
and improved detection of AF have been observed. [1037] The lifetime risk

**3372** ESC Guidelines


of AF has been estimated to be as high as 1 in 3 for older individuals, [1038]

with age-standardized incidence rates higher for men than women.
Populations of European ancestry are typically found to have higher
AF prevalence, individuals of African ancestry have worse outcomes,
and other groups may have less access to interventions. [1039][–][1041]

Socioeconomic and other factors likely play a role in racial and ethnic

differences in AF, but studies are also limited due to differences in

how groups access healthcare. Greater deprivation in socioeconomic
and living status is associated with higher AF incidence. [1042]


**10.2. Screening tools for AF**
In recent years, an abundance of novel devices that can monitor heart
rhythm have come to the market, including fitness bands and smart-­
watches. Although the evidence for clinical effectiveness of digital de-­
vices is limited, they may be useful in detecting AF, and their clinical,
economic, legal, and policy implications merit further investiga-­
tion. [1043][,][1044] Devices for AF detection can broadly be divided into those
that provide an ECG, and those with non-ECG approaches such as
photoplethysmography ( *Figure 15* and *Table 15* ).










Figure 15 Non-invasive diagnostic methods for AF screening. AF, atrial fibrillation; BP, blood pressure; ECG, electrocardiogram; PPG,
photoplethysmography.

ESC Guidelines **3373**

Table 15 **Tools for AF screening**










ECG, electrocardiogram.

Most consumer-based devices use photoplethysmography, and
several large studies have been performed typically in low-risk indi-­
viduals. [633][,][1076][,][1117][,][1118] In an RCT of 5551 participants invited by
their health insurer, smartphone-based photoplethysmography in-­
creased the odds of OAC-treated new AF by 2.12 (95% CI,
1.19–3.76; *P* = .01) compared with usual care. [605] RCTs powered
for assessment of clinical outcomes are still lacking for consumerbased AF screening. Further head-to-head comparisons between
novel digital devices and those commonly used in healthcare set-­
tings are needed to establish their comparative effectiveness in
the clinical setting and account for different populations and set-­
tings. [1119] In a systematic review of smartphone-based photo-­
plethysmography compared with a reference ECG, unrealistically
high sensitivity and specificity were noted, likely due to small, lowquality studies with a high degree of patient selection bias. [1120]

Hence, when AF is suggested by a photoplethysmography device
or any other screening tool, a single-lead or continuous ECG tra-­
cing of >30 s or 12-lead ECG showing AF analysed by a physician
with expertise in ECG rhythm interpretation is recommended to
establish a definitive diagnosis of AF. [1091][,][1121][–][1125]

The combination of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) is hav-­
ing an increasing impact on the field of electrophysiology.
Algorithms have been created to improve automated AF diagnosis
and several algorithms to aid diagnostics are being investigated. [1046]

However, the clinical performance and broad applicability of these
solutions are not yet known. The use of AI may enable future
treatment changes to be assessed with dynamic and continuous
patient-directed monitoring using wearable devices. [1126] There are
still challenges in the field that need clarification, such as data acqui-­
sition, model performance, external validity, clinical implementation,
algorithm interpretation, and confidence, as well as the ethical
aspects. [1127]


**10.3. Screening strategies for AF**
Screening can be performed systematically, with an invitation issued to
a patient, or opportunistically, at the time of an *ad hoc* meeting with a
healthcare professional. Regardless of the mode of invitation, screening
should be part of a structured programme [1128] and is not the same as
identification of AF during a routine healthcare visit or secondary to ar-­
rhythmia symptoms.

Screening can be done at a single timepoint (snapshot of the heart
rhythm), e.g. using pulse palpation or a 12-lead ECG. Screening can
also be of an extended duration, i.e. prolonged, using either intermittent
or continuous monitoring of heart rhythm. Most studies using an oppor-­
tunistic strategy have screened for AF at a single timepoint with short
duration (such as a single timepoint ECG), compared with systematic
screening studies that have mainly used prolonged (repeated or continu-­
ous) rhythm assessment. [1129] The optimal screening method will vary de-­
pending on the population being studied ( *Figure 16* [) (see Supplementary](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)
data online, *[Additional Evidence Table S32](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). More sensitive methods will
detect more AF but may lead to an increased risk of false positives and
an increased detection of low burden AF, whereas more specific meth-­
ods result in less false positives, at the risk of missing AF.

Invasive monitoring of heart rhythm in high-risk populations ex-­
tended for several years has been shown to result in device-detected
AF prevalence of around 30%, albeit most of whom have a low burden
of AF. [5][,][857][,][1130][,][1131] Pacemaker studies have shown that patients with a
low burden of device-detected subclinical AF have a lower risk of is-­
chaemic stroke. [5][,][24][,][1131][,][1132] This has been confirmed in RCTs assessing
DOAC use in patients with device-detected subclinical AF (see *Section*
*6.1.1* ). [5][,][281][,][282] The burden needed for device-detected subclinical AF to
translate into stroke risk is not known, and further studies are clearly
needed. [1133][,][1134] Benefit and cost-effectiveness of screening are dis-­
[cussed in the Supplementary data online.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)

**10.3.1. Single timepoint screening ‘snapshot’**

Several cluster RCTs in primary care settings have explored whether
screening performed as a snapshot of the heart rhythm at one time-­
point can detect more AF compared with usual care in individuals
aged ≥65 years. [1138][–][1140] No increased detection of AF was seen in
groups randomized to single timepoint screening. [1138][–][1140] These find-­
ings were confirmed in a meta-analysis of RCTs showing that screening
as a one-time event did not increase detection of AF compared with
usual care. [1135] Notably, these studies were performed in healthcare
settings where the detection of AF in the population might be high,
hence the results might not be generalizable to healthcare settings
with a lower spontaneous AF detection. There are no RCTs addressing
clinical outcomes in patients with AF detected by single timepoint
screening. [1123][,][1135]

**10.3.2. Prolonged screening**

Studies using prolonged screening have shown an increased detection
of AF leading to initiation of OAC. [1129][,][1135][,][1141] Two RCTs have inves-­
tigated the effect on clinical outcomes in prolonged screening for AF. [5][,][6]

and Halland, Sweden), 75- and 76-year-olds were randomized to be in-­
vited to prolonged screening for AF using single-lead ECGs twice daily
for 2 weeks, or to standard of care. After a median of 6.9 years there
was a small reduction in the primary combined endpoint of all-cause
mortality, stroke, systematic embolism, and severe bleeding in favour
of prolonged screening (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92–1.00; *P* = .045). [6] In

mized to receive an implantable loop recorder that monitored heart
rhythm for an average of 3.3 years, or to a control group receiving
standard of care. Although there was a higher detection of AF
(31.8%) and subsequent initiation of OAC in the loop recorder
group compared with standard of care (12.2%), this was not accom-­
panied by a difference in the primary outcome of stroke or systemic
embolism. [5] In a meta-analysis of recent RCTs on the outcome of
stroke, a small but significant benefit was seen in favour of prolonged
screening (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.99). [1136] This was not repeated
in a second meta-analysis including older RCTs, where no risk reduc-­
tion was seen with regard to mortality or stroke. [1135] Notably, both
these meta-analyses are likely underpowered to assess clinical

outcomes.

**10.4. Factors associated with incident AF**

The most common risk predictors for incident (new-onset) AF are
shown in *Table 16* . While the factors listed are robustly associated
with incident AF in observational studies, it is not known whether
the relationships are causal. Studies using Mendelian randomization
(genetic proxies for risk factors to estimate causal effects) robustly im-­
plicate systolic BP and higher BMI as causal risk factors for incident
AF. [1142]

A high degree of interaction occurs between all factors related to AF
development (see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Additional Evidence*
*[Table S33](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)* ). [1038][,][1039][,][1143][–][1145] For ease of clinical application, risk predic-­
tion tools have combined various factors, and have recently employed
machine learning algorithms for prediction. [1146][,][1147] Classical risk scores
are also available with variable predictive ability and model performance
(see [Supplementary data online,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) *Table S7* ). [1148] Improved outcomes
when using these risk scores have yet to be demonstrated. Although
knowledge is rapidly increasing about the genetic basis for AF in
some patients, the value of genetic screening is limited at the present
[time (see Supplementary data online).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)

**10.5. Primary prevention of AF**
Preventing the onset of AF before clinical manifestation has clear
potential to improve the lives of the general population and reduce

the considerable health and social care costs associated with

development of AF. Whereas the [C] in AF-CARE is focused on the
effective management of risk factors and comorbidities to limit AF
recurrence and progression, there is also evidence they can be targeted
to prevent AF. Available data are presented below for hypertension,
heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, sleep apnoea syndrome,



**3376** ESC Guidelines


physical activity, and alcohol, although many other risk markers can
also be targeted. Further information on each factor’s attributable
risk for AF is provided in the [Supplementary data online (see](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data)

a Class of recommendation.
b Level of evidence.

**10.5.1. Hypertension**

Management of hypertension has been associated with a reduction in
incident AF. [1205][–][1207][,][1232] In the LIFE (Losartan Intervention for End
point reduction in hypertension) trial, a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic
BP was associated with a 17% reduction in incident AF. [1207] Secondary
analysis of RCTs and observational studies suggest that ACE inhibitors
or ARBs may be superior to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or
diuretics for the prevention of incident AF. [1233][–][1236]

**10.5.2. Heart failure**

Long-standing established pharmacological treatments for HFrEF have
been associated with a reduction in incident AF. The use of ACE inhi-­
bitors or ARBs in patients with known HFrEF was associated with a
44% reduction in incidence of AF. [1208] Similarly, beta-blockers in
HFrEF led to a 33% reduction in the odds of incident AF. [133]

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have also been shown to re-­
duce the risk of new-onset AF by 42% in patients with HFrEF. [1209]

Although there have been variable effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on


incident AF, several meta-analyses have demonstrated that there is
an 18%–37% reduction in incident AF. [136][,][1210][,][1211][,][1237] However, treat-­
ment of HFrEF with sacubitril/valsartan has not yet been shown to con-­
fer any adjunctive benefit in reducing new-onset AF when compared
with ACE inhibitors/ARBs alone. [1238] There is some evidence to suggest
that effective CRT in eligible patients with HFrEF reduces the risk of in-­
cident AF. [1239] To date, no treatments in HFpEF have been shown to

reduce incident AF.

**10.5.3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus**
The integrated care of type 2 diabetes, based on lifestyle and pharma-­
cological treatments for comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension,
and dyslipidaemia, are useful steps in preventing atrial remodelling
and subsequent AF. Intensive glucose-lowering therapy targeting an
HbA1c level of <6.0% (<42 mmol/mol) failed to show a protective ef-­
fect on incident AF. [1240] More than glycaemic control *per se*, the class of
glucose-lowering agent may influence the risk of AF. [1240] Insulin pro-­
motes adipogenesis and cardiac fibrosis, and sulfonylureas have been
consistently associated with an increased risk of AF. [193] Observational

studies have associated metformin with lower rates of incident
AF. [1224][,][1225][,][1241][–][1243] Various recent studies and meta-analyses point
to the positive role of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of incident
AF in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. [136][,][1226][,][1244][–][1246] Pooled
data from 22 trials including 52 951 patients with type 2 diabetes and
heart failure showed that SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo
can significantly reduce the incidence of AF by 18% in studies on dia-­
betes, and up to 37% in heart failure with or without type 2
diabetes. [1210][,][1211]

**10.5.4. Obesity**

Management of weight is important in the prevention of AF. In a large
population-based cohort study, normal weight was associated with a
reduced risk of incident AF compared with those who were obese
(4.7% increase in the risk of incident AF for each 1 kg/m [2 ] increase of
BMI). [208] In the Women’s Health Study, participants who became obese
had a 41% increased risk of incident AF compared with those who
maintained their BMI <30 kg/m [2] . [1212] Similarly, observational studies
in populations using bariatric surgery for weight loss in morbidly obese
individuals (BMI ≥40 kg/m [2] ) have observed a lower risk of incident
AF. [1227][–][1231]

**10.5.5. Sleep apnoea syndrome**

Although it would seem rational to optimize sleep habits, to date there
is no conclusive evidence to support this for the primary prevention of
AF. The SAVE (Sleep Apnea cardioVascular Endpoints) trial failed to

demonstrate a difference in clinical outcomes in those randomized to
CPAP therapy or placebo. [230] There was no difference in incident AF,
albeit the analysis of AF was not based on systematic screening but ra-­
ther on clinically documented AF.

**10.5.6. Physical activity**
Several studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of moderate phys-­
ical activity on cardiovascular health. [1247] Moderate aerobic exercise
may also reduce the risk of new-onset AF. [1214][–][1219] It should be noted
that the incidence of AF appears to be increased among athletes, with a
meta-analysis of observational studies showing a 2.5-fold increased risk
of AF compared with non-athlete controls. [1248]

ESC Guidelines **3377**


**10.5.7. Alcohol intake**

The premise that reducing alcohol intake can prevent AF is based on
observational studies linking alcohol to an excess risk of incident AF
[in a dose-dependent manner (see Supplementary data online).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae176#supplementary-data) [1220][–][1222]

In addition, a population cohort study of those with high alcohol con-­
sumption (>60 g/day for men and >40 g/day for women) found that ab-­
stinence from alcohol was associated with a lower incidence of AF
compared with patients who continued heavy drinking. [1223]
###### **11. Key messages**

(1) General management: optimal treatment according to the
AF-CARE pathway, which includes: [C] Comorbidity and risk fac-­
tor management; [A] Avoid stroke and thromboembolism; [R]
Reduce symptoms by rate and rhythm control; and [E]
Evaluation and dynamic reassessment.
(2) Shared care: patient-centred AF management with joint decisionmaking and a multidisciplinary team.
(3) Equal care: avoid health inequalities based on gender, ethnicity,
disability, and socioeconomic factors.
(4) Education: for patients, family members, caregivers, and health-­

care professionals to aid shared decision-making.
(5) Diagnosis: clinical AF requires confirmation on an ECG device to
initiate risk stratification and AF management.
(6) Initial evaluation: medical history, assessment of symptoms and
their impact, blood tests, echocardiography/other imaging,
patient-reported outcome measures, and risk factors for
thromboembolism and bleeding.
(7) Comorbidities and risk factors: thorough evaluation and manage-­

ment critical to all aspects of care for patients with AF to avoid
recurrence and progression of AF, improve success of AF treat-­
ments, and prevent AF-related adverse outcomes.
(8) Focus on conditions associated with AF: including hypertension,
heart failure, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnoea,
physical inactivity, and high alcohol intake.
(9) Assessing the risk of thromboembolism: use locally validated risk
tools or the CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score and assessment of other risk fac-­
tors, with reassessment at periodic intervals to assist in decisions
on anticoagulant prescription.
(10) Oral anticoagulants: recommended for all eligible patients, except

those at low risk of incident stroke or thromboembolism

(CHA 2 DS 2 -VA = 1 anticoagulation should be considered;
CHA 2 DS 2 -VA ≥2 anticoagulation recommended).
(11) Choice of anticoagulant: DOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxa-­

ban, and rivaroxaban) are preferred over VKAs (warfarin and
others), except in patients with mechanical heart valves and mitral

stenosis.

(12) Dose/range of anticoagulant: use full standard doses for DOACs
unless the patient meets specific dose-reduction criteria; for
VKAs, keep INR generally 2.0–3.0, and in range for >70% of the

time.

(13) Switching anticoagulants: switch from a VKA to DOAC if risk of
intracranial haemorrhage or poor control of INR levels.
(14) Bleeding risk: modifiable bleeding risk factors should be managed
to improve safety; bleeding risk scores should not be used to de-­
cide on starting or withdrawing anticoagulants.
(15) Antiplatelet therapy: avoid combining anticoagulants and antipla-­

telet agents, unless the patient has an acute vascular event or
needs interim treatment for procedures.


(16) Rate control therapy: use beta-blockers (any ejection fraction), di-­

goxin (any ejection fraction), or diltiazem/verapamil (LVEF >40%)
as initial therapy in the acute setting, an adjunct to rhythm control
therapies, or as a sole treatment strategy to control heart rate and

symptoms.
(17) Rhythm control: consider in all suitable AF patients, explicitly dis-­

cussing with patients all potential benefits and risks of cardiover-­
sion, antiarrhythmic drugs, and catheter or surgical ablation to
reduce symptoms and morbidity.
(18) Safety first: keep safety and anticoagulation in mind when consid-­

ering rhythm control; e.g. delay cardioversion and provide at least
3 weeks of anticoagulation beforehand if AF duration >24 h, and
consider toxicity and drug interactions for antiarrhythmic
therapy.
(19) Cardioversion: use electrical cardioversion in cases of haemo-­

dynamic instability; otherwise choose electrical or pharmacologic-­
al cardioversion based on patient characteristics and preferences.
(20) Indication for long-term rhythm control: the primary indication
should be reduction in AF-related symptoms and improvement
in quality of life; for selected patient groups, sinus rhythm main-­
tenance can be pursued to reduce morbidity and mortality.
(21) Success or failure of rhythm control: continue anticoagulation ac-­

cording to the patient’s individual risk of thromboembolism, irre-­
spective of whether they are in AF or sinus rhythm.
(22) Catheter ablation: consider as second-line option if antiarrhyth-­

mic drugs fail to control AF, or first-line option in patients with
paroxysmal AF.
(23) Endoscopic or hybrid ablation: consider if catheter ablation fails,
or an alternative to catheter ablation in persistent AF despite anti-­
arrhythmic drugs.
(24) Atrial fibrillation ablation during cardiac surgery: perform in cen-­

tres with experienced teams, especially for patients undergoing
mitral valve surgery.
(25) Dynamic evaluation: periodically reassess therapy and give atten-­

tion to new modifiable risk factors that could slow/reverse the
progression of AF, increase quality of life, and prevent adverse

outcomes.
###### **12. Gaps in evidence**

The following bullet list gives the most important gaps in evidence
where new clinical trials could substantially aid the patient pathway:

**Definition and clinical impact of AF**

- Paroxysmal AF is not one entity, and patterns of AF progression and
regression are highly variable. It is uncertain what the relevance is for
treatment strategies and management decisions.

- Thirty seconds as definition for clinical AF needs validation and evalu-­

ation whether it is related to AF-related outcomes.

- Definition, clinical features, diagnosis, and implementation for treat-­

ment choices of atrial cardiomyopathy in patients with AF is

unsettled.

- Diversity in AF presentation, underlying pathophysiological mechan-­

isms, and associated comorbidities is incompletely understood with
regard to differences in sex, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
state, education, and differences between low-, moderate-, and high
income countries.

- Personalized risk prediction for AF incidence, AF progression, and as-­

sociated outcomes remains challenging.

**3378** ESC Guidelines



- Insights into psychosocial and environmental factors and risk of AF

and adverse outcomes in AF are understudied.

**Patient-centred, multidisciplinary AF management**

- The benefit of additional education directed to patients, to family
members, and to healthcare professionals in order to optimize
shared decision-making still needs to be proved.

- Access to patient-centred management according to the AF-CARE
principles to ensure equality in healthcare provision and improve out-­
comes warrants evidence.

- The place of remote monitoring and telemedicine for identification
and follow-up of patients with AF, or its subgroups is non-established,
though widely applied.

**[C] Comorbidity and risk factor management**

- Methods to achieve consistent and reproducible weight loss in pa-­

tients with AF requires substantial improvement. Despite some evi-­
dence demonstrating the benefits of weight loss, widespread
adoption has been limited by the need for reproducible strategies.

- The importance of sleep apnoea syndrome and its treatment on

AF-related outcomes remains to be elucidated.

**[A] Avoid stroke and thromboembolism**

- Data are lacking on how to treat patients with low risk of stroke (with
a CHA 2 DS 2 -VA score of 0 or 1), as these patients were excluded
from large RCTs.

- Not enough evidence is available for OAC in elderly patients, frail
polypharmacy patients, those with cognitive impairment/dementia,
recent bleeding, previous ICH, severe end-stage renal failure, liver im-­
pairment, cancer, or severe obesity.

- In elderly patients, routinely switching VKAs to DOACs is associated
with increased bleeding risk; however, the reasons why this happens

are unclear.

- The selection of which patients with asymptomatic device-detected
subclinical AF benefit from OAC therapy needs to be defined.

- There is a lack of evidence whether and when to (re)start anticoagu-­

lation after intracranial haemorrhage.

- There is lack of evidence about optimal anticoagulation in patients
with ischaemic stroke or left atrial thrombus while being treated

with OAC.

- There is uncertainty about the place of LAA closure and how to man-­

age antithrombotic post-procedural management when LAAO is
performed.

- Balance of thromboembolism and bleeding is unclear in patients with
AF and incidental cerebral artery aneurysms identified on brain MRI.

**[R] Reduce symptoms by rate and rhythm control**

- In some patients, AF can be benign in terms of symptoms and out-­

comes. In which patients rhythm control is not needed warrants
investigation.

- Application of antiarrhythmic drugs has been hampered by poor ef-­

fectiveness and side effects; however, new antiarrhythmic drugs are
needed to increase the therapeutic arsenal for AF patients.



- The amount of AF reduction obtained by rhythm control to improve

outcomes is unknown.

- Large catheter ablation studies showed no improved outcome of
patients with AF. Some small studies in specific subpopulations
have observed an improved outcome. This warrants further inves-­
tigation to provide each patient with AF with personalized treat-­
ment goals.

- Uncertainty exists on the time of duration of AF and risk of stroke
when performing a cardioversion.

- The value of diagnostic cardioversion for persistent AF in steering
management of AF is unknown.

- Decisions on continuation of OAC are completely based on stroke
risk scores and irrespective of having (episodes) of AF; whether
this holds for patients undergoing successful catheter ablation is

uncertain.

- Large variability in ablation strategies and techniques exist for pa-­

tients with persistent AF, or after first failed catheter ablation for par-­
oxysmal AF. The optimal catheter ablation strategy and techniques,
however, are unknown.

- Sham-controlled intervention studies are lacking to determine the ef-­

fects on AF symptoms, quality of life, and PROMS, accounting for the
placebo effect that is associated with interventions.

**The AF-CARE pathway in specific clinical settings**

- The optimal duration of triple therapy in patients with AF at high risk
of recurrent coronary events after acute coronary syndrome is

unclear.

- The role of the coronary vessel involved and whether this should im-­

pact on the duration of combined OAC and antiplatelet treatment
needs further study.

- The role of antiplatelet therapy in patients with AF and peripheral ar-­

tery disease on OAC is uncertain.

- The use of DOACs in patients with congenital heart disease, particu-­

larly in patients with complex corrected congenital defects, is poorly

studied.

- Improved risk stratification for stroke in patients with AF and cancer,
or with post-operative or trigger-induced AF is needed to inform on

OAC treatment decisions.

**Screening and prevention of AF**

- There are a lack of adequately powered randomized controlled stud-­

ies on ischaemic stroke rate in patients screened for AF, both in the
primary prevention setting and in secondary prevention (poststroke), and its cost-effectiveness.

- Population selection that might benefit the most from screening, the
optimal duration of screening, and the burden of AF that might in-­
crease the risk for patients with screening-detected AF are uncertain.

- Evaluation of strategies to support longer-term use of technologies

for AF detection are awaited.

- The role of photoplethysmography technology for AF screening in an

effort to assess AF burden and reduce stroke is still unclear.

- How new consumer devices and wearable technology can be used
for diagnostic and monitoring purposes in routine clinical practice
needs to be clarified.
