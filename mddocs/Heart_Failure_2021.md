### 1 Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines and
their recommendations should facilitate decision making of health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning
an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


societies and organizations. Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been
established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user.
The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines
[can be found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.
In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice guidelines, the ESC
carries out the EURObservational Research Programme of international
registries of cardiovascular (CV) diseases and interventions which are
essential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources
and adherence to guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better
understanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world,
based on high-quality data collected during routine clinical practice.
Furthermore, the ESC has developed and embedded in this document
a set of quality indicators (QIs), which are tools to evaluate the level of
implementation of the guidelines and may be used by the ESC, hospitals,
healthcare providers and professionals to measure clinical practice as
well as used in educational programmes, alongside the key messages
from the guidelines, to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes.
The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in
order to represent professionals involved with the medical care of
patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a
comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of
a given condition according to ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines
(CPG) Committee policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the
risk�benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and
graded according to predefined scales, as outlined below.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of
interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest
[rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[guidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
supplementary document simultaneously to the guidelines.
This process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in
the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of
interest that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC
and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from
the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement
process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive
review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions
the guidelines are signed-off by all the experts involved in the Task
Force. The finalized document is signed-off by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The guidelines were developed
after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge
and the evidence available at the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation of
educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary slides,
summary cards for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital
applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus,

for more detailed information, the user should always access to the full
text version of the guidelines, which is freely available via the ESC website and hosted on the European Heart Journal website. The National
Cardiac Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, adopt, translate and implement all ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes

are needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease

judgment, as well as in the determination and the implementation
of preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic medical strategies.
However, the ESC Guidelines do not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of health professionals to make
appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each
patient’s health condition and in consultation with that patient or
the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is
also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and
regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the
time of prescription.

ESC Guidelines 3609

### 2 Introduction

The aim of this ESC Guideline is to help health professionals manage
people with heart failure (HF) according to the best available evidence. Fortunately, we now have a wealth of clinical trials to help us
select the best management to improve the outcomes for people
with HF; for many, it is now both preventable and treatable. This
guideline provides practical, evidence-based recommendations.
We have revised the format of the previous 2016 ESC HF
Guidelines [1] to make each phenotype of HF stand-alone in terms of
its diagnosis and management. The therapy recommendations mention the treatment effect supported by the class and level of evidence
and are presented in tables. For HF with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF), the tabular recommendations focus on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Where there are symptomatic benefits, these are
highlighted in the text and/or in the web appendices. Detailed summaries of the trials underpinning the recommendations are available
in the web appendices. For diagnostic indications, we have suggested
investigations that all patients with HF should receive, and investigations that can be targeted to specific circumstances. As diagnostic
tests have rarely been subject to randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), most of the evidence would be regarded as level C.
However, that does not mean that there has not been appropriate
rigorous evaluation of diagnostic tests.
In this guideline, we have decided to focus on the diagnosis and
treatment of HF, not on its prevention. Management of CV risk and
many CV diseases [especially systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AF), and asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction]
will reduce the risk of developing HF, which is addressed by many
other ESC Guidelines and in section 9.1 of the current guideline. [2][�][7]

This guideline is the result of a collaboration between the Task
Force (including two patient representatives), the reviewers, and the
ESC CPG Committee. As such, it is a consensus/majority opinion of
the experts consulted in its development.

### 3 Definition, epidemiology and prognosis

3.1 Definition of heart failure

Heart failure is not a single pathological diagnosis, but a clinical syndrome consisting of cardinal symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle
swelling, and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g. elevated
jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral
oedema). It is due to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the
heart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise.
Identification of the aetiology of the underlying cardiac dysfunction
is mandatory in the diagnosis of HF as the specific pathology can
determine subsequent treatment. Most commonly, HF is due to
myocardial dysfunction: either systolic, diastolic, or both. However,
pathology of the valves, pericardium, and endocardium, and abnormalities of heart rhythm and conduction can also cause or contribute

to HF.

. [........................................................]


3.2 Terminology
3.2.1 Heart failure with preserved, mildly reduced, and
reduced ejection fraction
Traditionally, HF has been divided into distinct phenotypes based on
the measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
(Table 3). The rationale behind this relates to the original treatment
trials in HF that demonstrated substantially improved outcomes in
patients with LVEF <_40%. However, HF spans the entire range of
LVEF (a normally distributed variable), and measurement by echocardiography is subject to substantial variability. We have decided on the
following classification of HF (Table 3):

 - [Reduced LVEF is defined as <_40%, i.e. those with a significant]

reduction in LV systolic function. This is designated as HFrEF.

 - [Patients with a LVEF between 41% and 49% have][ mildly][ reduced]

LV systolic function, i.e. HFmrEF. Retrospective analyses from
RCTs in HFrEF or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)
that have included patients with ejection fractions in the
40�50% range suggest that they may benefit from similar

ESC Guidelines 3613

HF = heart failure; HFmrEF = heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction; HFpEF = heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF = heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; LV = left ventricle; LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction.
a Signs may not be present in the early stages of HF (especially in HFpEF) and in optimally treated patients.
b For the diagnosis of HFmrEF, the presence of other evidence of structural heart disease (e.g. increased left atrial size, LV hypertrophy or echocardiographic measures of
impaired LV filling) makes the diagnosis more likely.
c For the diagnosis of HFpEF, the greater the number of abnormalities present, the higher the likelihood of HFpEF.


therapies to those with LVEF <_40%. [8][�][13] This supports the
renaming of HFmrEF from ‘heart failure with mid-range ejection
fraction’ to ‘heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction’. [14]

[Those with symptoms and signs of HF, with evidence of]

structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and/or raised

natriuretic peptides (NPs), and with an LVEF >_50%, have HFpEF.

The diagnosis of HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF is covered in more
detail in their respective sections (sections 5, 7, and 8, respectively).
These definitions are consistent with a recent report on the
Universal Definition of Heart Failure. [15]

Patients with non-CV disease, e.g. anaemia, pulmonary, renal, thyroid, or hepatic disease may have symptoms and signs very similar to
those of HF, but in the absence of cardiac dysfunction, they do not
fulfil the criteria for HF. However, these pathologies can coexist with
HF and exacerbate the HF syndrome.

3.2.2 Right ventricular dysfunction
Heart failure can also be a result of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. RV mechanics and function are altered in the setting of either
pressure or volume overload. [16] Although the main aetiology of
chronic RV failure is LV dysfunction-induced pulmonary hypertension, there are a number of other causes of RV dysfunction [e.g.
MI, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), or

[17] The diagnosis is determined by a quantitative
assessment of global RV function, most commonly by echocardiography, using at least one of the following measurements: fractional area change (FAC); tricuspid annular plane systolic
excursion (TAPSE); and Doppler tissue imaging-derived systolic S [0]

velocity of the tricuspid annulus. The diagnosis and management
of RV dysfunction is covered comprehensively in a recent Heart
Failure Association (HFA) position paper. [18]

3.2.3 Other common terminology used in heart failure
Heart failure is usually divided into two presentations: chronic heart
failure (CHF) and acute heart failure (AHF). CHF describes those
who have had an established diagnosis of HF or who have a more

. [.................................................................................................................]


slowly, the episode may be described as ‘decompensated’ HF. This
can result in a hospital admission or treatment with intravenous (i.v.)
diuretic therapy in the outpatient setting. In addition, HF can present
more acutely. Both of these are considered in the section on AHF
(section 11).
Some individuals with HF may recover completely [e.g. those due
to alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy (CMP), viral myocarditis,
Takotsubo syndrome, peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), or
tachycardiomyopathy]. Other patients with LV systolic dysfunction
may show a substantial or even complete recovery of LV systolic
function after receiving drug and device therapy.

3.2.4 Terminology related to the symptomatic severity of

heart failure

The simplest terminology used to describe the severity of HF is the
New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification
(Table 4). However, this relies solely on symptoms and there are
many other better prognostic indicators in HF. [19] Importantly,
patients with mild symptoms may still have a high risk of hospitalization and death. [20] Predicting outcome is particularly important in
advanced HF to guide selection of cardiac transplantation and device
therapies. This will be covered in detail in the section on advanced
HF (section 10).

3.3 Epidemiology and natural history of
heart failure

3.3.1 Incidence and prevalence
In developed countries, the age-adjusted incidence of HF may be falling, presumably reflecting better management of CV disease, but due
to ageing, the overall incidence is increasing. [21][�][24] Currently, the incidence of HF in Europe is about 3/1000 person-years (all age-groups)
or about 5/1000 person-years in adults. [25][,][26] The prevalence of HF
appears to be 1�2% of adults. [21][,][27][�][31] As studies only usually include
recognized/diagnosed HF cases, the true prevalence is likely to be
higher. [32] The prevalence increases with age: from around 1% for
those aged <55 years to >10% in those aged 70 years or over. [33][�][36] It



- [Those with symptoms and signs of HF, with evidence of]

structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and/or raised

natriuretic peptides (NPs), and with an LVEF >_50%, have HFpEF.


The diagnosis of HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF is covered in more
detail in their respective sections (sections 5, 7, and 8, respectively).
These definitions are consistent with a recent report on the
Universal Definition of Heart Failure. [15]

Patients with non-CV disease, e.g. anaemia, pulmonary, renal, thyroid, or hepatic disease may have symptoms and signs very similar to
those of HF, but in the absence of cardiac dysfunction, they do not
fulfil the criteria for HF. However, these pathologies can coexist with
HF and exacerbate the HF syndrome.


3.2.2 Right ventricular dysfunction
Heart failure can also be a result of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. RV mechanics and function are altered in the setting of either
pressure or volume overload. [16] Although the main aetiology of
chronic RV failure is LV dysfunction-induced pulmonary hypertension, there are a number of other causes of RV dysfunction [e.g.
MI, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), or
valve disease]. [17] The diagnosis is determined by a quantitative
assessment of global RV function, most commonly by echocardiography, using at least one of the following measurements: fractional area change (FAC); tricuspid annular plane systolic
excursion (TAPSE); and Doppler tissue imaging-derived systolic S [0]

velocity of the tricuspid annulus. The diagnosis and management
of RV dysfunction is covered comprehensively in a recent Heart
Failure Association (HFA) position paper. [18]


3.2.3 Other common terminology used in heart failure
Heart failure is usually divided into two presentations: chronic heart
failure (CHF) and acute heart failure (AHF). CHF describes those
who have had an established diagnosis of HF or who have a more
gradual onset of symptoms. If CHF deteriorates, either suddenly or

3614 ESC Guidelines


those who remain stable or transition to a higher ejection fraction
category. [48][�][52]

HFpEF is generally considered to confer a better survival than

HFrEF, but most observational studies show that this difference is
negligible. [45][,][46] In contrast, the large MAGGIC meta-analysis concluded that the adjusted mortality risk for patients with HFpEF was
considerably lower than in patients with HFrEF. [53]

Studies from several countries have shown that between 1980 and
2000 survival in HF patients has improved markedly. [41][,][54][�][57]

However, this positive trend may have levelled off since then. [45]

After the initial diagnosis, HF patients are hospitalized once every
year on average. [54] From 2000 to 2010, the mean rate of hospitalization in the Olmsted County cohort was 1.3 per person-year.
Interestingly, the majority (63%) of hospitalizations were related to
non-CV causes. [45] Studies from several European countries and the
United States (US) have shown that HF hospitalization rates peaked
in the 1990s, and then declined. [54][,][55] - [,][58][�][60] However, in a recent

study of incident HF conducted between 1998 and 2017 in the
United Kingdom (UK), age-adjusted rates of first hospitalizations
increased by 28% for both all-cause and HF admissions, and by 42%
for non-CV admissions. [61] These increases were higher in women,
perhaps related to higher comorbidity rates. The risk of HF hospitalization is 1.5 times higher in patients with diabetes compared to controls. AF, a higher body mass index (BMI), and higher glycated
haemoglobin (HbA1c), as well as a low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are strong predictors of HF hospitalizations. [29]

Due to population growth, ageing, and the increasing prevalence
of comorbidities, the absolute number of hospital admissions for HF
is expected to increase considerably in the future, perhaps by as
much as 50% in the next 25 years. [24][,][62]
### 4 Chronic heart failure

4.1 Key steps in the diagnosis of chronic
heart failure

The diagnosis of CHF requires the presence of symptoms and/or
signs of HF and objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (Figure 1).
Typical symptoms include breathlessness, fatigue, and ankle swelling
(Table 6). Symptoms and signs lack sufficient accuracy to be used
alone to make the diagnosis of HF. [63][�][66]

The diagnosis of CHF is made more likely in patients with a history
of MI, arterial hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, alcohol misuse,
chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiotoxic chemotherapy, and in
those with a family history of CMP or sudden death.
The following diagnostic tests are recommended for the assessment of patients with suspected chronic HF:

(1) Electrocardiogram (ECG). A normal ECG makes the diagnosis of
HF unlikely. [63] The ECG may reveal abnormalities such as AF, Q

waves, LV hypertrophy (LVH), and a widened QRS complex

(Table 7) that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of HF and also

may guide therapy.

is generally believed that, of those with HF, about 50% have HFrEF
and 50% have HFpEF/HFmrEF, mainly based on studies in hospitalized
patients. [32][,][35][,][37][,][38] The ESC Long-Term Registry, in the outpatient setting, reports that 60% have HFrEF, 24% have HFmrEF, and 16% have
HFpEF. [39] Somewhat more than 50% of HF patients are female. [21][,][40][,][41]

3.3.2 Aetiology of heart failure
The most common causes (as well as some key investigations)
of HF are shown in Table 5. The aetiology of HF varies according
to geography. In Western-type and developed countries,
coronary artery disease (CAD) and hypertension are predominant factors. [27]

With regard to ischaemic aetiology, HFmrEF resembles HFrEF,
with a higher frequency of underlying CAD compared to those with
HFpEF. [38][,][42][,][43]

3.3.3 Natural history and prognosis
The prognosis of patients with HF has improved considerably since
the publication of the first treatment trials a few decades ago.
However, it remains poor, and quality of life (QOL) is also markedly
reduced. The improvement in prognosis has been confined to those

with HFrEF.

Mortality rates are higher in observational studies than in clinical
trials. [44] In the Olmsted County cohort, 1-year and 5-year mortality
rates after diagnosis, for all types of HF patients, were 20% and 53%,
respectively, between 2000 and 2010. [45] A study combining the
Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and Cardiovascular Health Study
(CHS) cohorts reported a 67% mortality rate within 5 years following
diagnosis. [46] Despite receiving less evidence-based treatment, women
have a better survival than men. [47]

Overall prognosis is better in HFmrEF compared to HFrEF. [39] Of
note, transition in ejection fraction over time is common, and patients
who progress from HFmrEF to HFrEF have a worse prognosis than

(2) Measurement of NPs are recommended, if available. A plasma

concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) <35 pg/mL,

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) <125 pg/

mL, or mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP)
<40 pmol/L [68] make a diagnosis of HF unlikely. These will be discussed in more detail in section 4.2. [69][,][70]

(3) Basic investigations such as serum urea and electrolytes, creatinine,

full blood count, liver and thyroid function tests are recommended

to differentiate HF from other conditions, to provide prognostic

information, and to guide potential therapy.

(4) Echocardiography is recommended as the key investigation for the

assessment of cardiac function. As well as the determination of the

LVEF, echocardiography also provides information on other param
eters such as chamber size, eccentric or concentric LVH, regional

wall motion abnormalities (that may suggest underlying CAD,

Takotsubo syndrome, or myocarditis), RV function, pulmonary

hypertension, valvular function, and markers of diastolic
function. [16][,][71]

(5) A chest X-ray is recommended to investigate other potential causes

of breathlessness (e.g. pulmonary disease). It may also provide sup
portive evidence of HF (e.g. pulmonary congestion or

cardiomegaly).

a This symptom of advanced HF corresponds to shortness of breath when leaning
forward. [67]

4.2.1 Use in the non-acute setting
The diagnostic value of NPs, in addition to signs and symptoms and
other diagnostic tests, such as an ECG, has been assessed in several
studies in the primary care setting. [68][,][76][�][80] The aim of these studies
was to either exclude or establish a diagnosis of HF. The Task Force
considered studies of adequate quality that included NP cut-off points
in their diagnostic algorithms, below which the probability of having HF
was extremely low. The upper limits of normal in the non-acute setting
are 35 pg/mL for BNP, and 125 pg/mL for NT-proBNP. In these studies, the negative predictive values of NP concentrations below these
thresholds range from 0.94 to 0.98. [76][�][78] Fewer data are available
for MR-proANP in CHF than in AHF. A concentration of <40 pmol/L
can be used to rule out HF. [68]

underlying aetiology of chronic heart
failure

4.2 Natriuretic peptides
Plasma concentrations of NPs are recommended as initial diagnostic
tests in patients with symptoms suggestive of HF to rule out the diagnosis. Elevated concentrations support a diagnosis of HF, are useful
for prognostication, [72] and may guide further cardiac investigation. [73]

However, it should be noted that there are many causes of an elevated NP—both CV and non-CV—that might reduce their diagnostic
accuracy (Table 7). These causes include AF, increasing age, and acute
or chronic kidney disease. [74] Conversely, NP concentrations may be
disproportionately low in obese patients. [75]

Exercise or pharmacological stress echocardiography may be used

for the assessment of inducible ischaemia in those who are considered suitable for coronary revascularization. [81] In patients with
HFpEF, valve disease, or unexplained dyspnoea, stress echocardiography might help clarify the diagnosis. [82]

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T1 mapping and extracellular volume
will identify myocardial fibrosis/scar, which are typically subendocardial for patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in contrast
to the mid-wall scar typical of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In
addition, CMR allows myocardial characterization in, e.g. myocarditis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, Chagas disease, Fabry disease, LV
non-compaction CMP, haemochromatosis, and arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy (AC). [83][,][84]

Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) may be
considered in patients with a low to intermediate pre-test probability
of CAD, or those with equivocal non-invasive stress tests in order to
exclude the diagnosis of CAD. [5]

Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) can also be used to assess
myocardial ischaemia and viability, myocardial inflammation or infiltration. Scintigraphy with technetium (Tc)-labelled bisphosphonate
has shown high sensitivity and specificity for imaging cardiac transthyretin amyloid. [85]

An algorithm for the diagnosis of HFrEF is depicted in Figure 1. For
the investigation of the underlying aetiology, please refer to Table 5.

5.2 Pharmacological treatments for
patients with heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction
5.2.1 Goals of pharmacotherapy for patients with heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction
Pharmacotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for HFrEF and
should be implemented before considering device therapy, and
alongside non-pharmacological interventions.
There are three major goals of treatment for patients with HFrEF:
(i) reduction in mortality, (ii) prevention of recurrent hospitalizations
due to worsening HF, and (iii) improvement in clinical status, functional capacity, and QOL. [100][�][102]

The key evidence supporting the recommendations in this section
[for patients with symptomatic HFrEF is given in Supplementary Table 1.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
Figure 2 depicts the algorithm for the treatment strategy, including
drugs and devices in patients with HFrEF, for Class I indications for
the reduction of mortality (either all-cause or CV). The recommen
dations for each treatment are summarized below.

5.2.2 General principles of pharmacotherapy for heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction
Modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous systems with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI),
beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA)
has been shown to improve survival, reduce the risk of HF hospitalizations, and reduce symptoms in patients with HFrEF. These drugs
serve as the foundations of pharmacotherapy for patients with

HFrEF. The triad of an ACE-I/ARNI, a beta-blocker, and an MRA is

recommended as cornerstone therapies for these patients, unless
the drugs are contraindicated or not tolerated. [103][�][105] They should
be uptitrated to the doses used in the clinical trials (or to maximally
tolerated doses if that is not possible). This guideline still recommends the use of ARNI as a replacement for ACE-I in suitable
patients who remain symptomatic on ACE-I, beta-blocker, and MRA
therapies; however, an ARNI may be considered as a first-line therapy instead of an ACE-I. [106][,][107] The recommended doses of these
drugs are given in Table 8. Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) still

have a role in those who are intolerant to ACE-I or ARNI.

The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin added to therapy with ACE-I/ARNI/betablocker/MRA reduced the risk of CV death and worsening HF in
patients with HFrEF. [108][,][109] Unless contraindicated or not tolerated,
dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are recommended for all patients with
HFrEF already treated with an ACE-I/ARNI, a beta-blocker, and an
MRA, regardless of whether they have diabetes or not.
Other drugs may be used for selected patients with HFrEF. These

are discussed in section 5.4.

Coronary angiography is recommended in patients with HF, who
have angina pectoris or an ‘angina equivalent’ despite pharmacological
therapy, in order to establish the diagnosis of CAD and its severity.
Coronary angiography may also be considered in patients with
HFrEF who have an intermediate to high pre-test probability of CAD
and who are considered potentially suitable for coronary
revascularization. [5]
### 5 Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

5.1 The diagnosis of heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction
The diagnosis of HFrEF requires the presence of symptoms and/or
signs of HF and a reduced ejection fraction (LVEF <_40%). This is
most usually obtained by echocardiography. Details about the
quality standards that should be adhered to when determining the
presence of reduced LV systolic function by echocardiography
can be found in the European Association of Cardiovascular
Imaging (EACVI) position paper. [99] If assessment of EF is not possible by echocardiography, then CMR or rarely, nuclear techniques
can be employed.

5.3.2 Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in
patients with HFrEF, in addition to treatment with an ACE-I and diuretic. [114][�][120] They also improve symptoms. [123] There is consensus
that ACE-I and beta-blockers can be commenced together as soon
as the diagnosis of symptomatic HFrEF is established. There is no evidence favouring the initiation of a beta-blocker before an ACE-I and
vice versa. [124] Beta-blockers should be initiated in clinically stable,
euvolaemic, patients at a low dose and gradually uptitrated to the
maximum tolerated dose. In patients admitted with AHF, betablockers should be cautiously initiated in hospital, once the patient is
haemodynamically stabilized.
An individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of all major betablocker trials in HFrEF has shown no benefit on hospital admissions
and mortality in the subgroup of patients with HFrEF with AF. [125]

However, since this is a retrospective subgroup analysis, and because
beta-blockers did not increase risk, the guideline committee decided
not to make a separate recommendation according to heart rhythm.

MRAs (spironolactone or eplerenone) are recommended, in addition
to an ACE-I and a beta-blocker, in all patients with HFrEF to reduce
mortality and the risk of HF hospitalization. [121][,][122] They also improve
symptoms. [121] MRAs block receptors that bind aldosterone and, with
different degrees of affinity, other steroid hormones (e.g. corticosteroid and androgen) receptors. Eplerenone is more specific for aldosterone blockade and, therefore, causes less gynaecomastia.
Caution should be exercised when MRAs are used in patients with
impaired renal function and in those with serum potassium concen
trations >5.0 mmol/L.

[Practical guidance on how to use MRAs is given in Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)

5.3.4 Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor

In the PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril/valsartan, an ARNI, was shown

to be superior to enalapril in reducing hospitalizations for worsening
HF, CV mortality, and all-cause mortality in patients with ambulatory
HFrEF with LVEF <_40% (changed to <_35% during the study). Patients
in the trial had elevated plasma NP concentrations, an eGFR >_30 mL/
min/1.73 m [2] and were able to tolerate enalapril and then sacubitril/
valsartan during the run-in period. [105] Additional benefits of sacubitril/
valsartan included an improvement in symptoms and QOL, [105] a
reduction in the incidence of diabetes requiring insulin treatment, [126]

and a reduction in the decline in eGFR, [127] as well as a reduced rate of
hyperkalaemia. [128] Additionally, the use of sacubitril/valsartan may
allow a reduction in loop diuretic requirement. [129] Symptomatic
hypotension was reported more commonly in patients treated with
sacubitril/valsartan as compared to enalapril, but despite developing
hypotension, these patients also gained clinical benefits from sacubitril/valsartan therapy. [128][,][130]

ACE-Is were the first class of drugs shown to reduce mortality and
morbidity in patients with HFrEF. [110][�][113] They have also been shown
to improve symptoms. [111] They are recommended in all patients
unless contraindicated or not tolerated. They should be uptitrated to

the maximum tolerated recommended doses.

3622 ESC Guidelines


Therefore, it is recommended that an ACE-I or ARB is replaced by
sacubitril/valsartan in ambulatory patients with HFrEF, who remain
symptomatic despite optimal treatment outlined above. Two studies
have examined the use of ARNI in hospitalized patients, some of
whom had not been previously treated with ACE-I. Initiation in this
setting appears safe and reduces subsequent CV death or HF hospitalizations by 42% compared to enalapril. [106][,][107][,][131] As such, initiation
of sacubitril/valsartan in ACE-I naive (i.e. de novo) patients with HFrEF
may be considered (class of recommendation IIb, level of evidence
. [............................]
B). Patients being commenced on sacubitril/valsartan should have an
adequate blood pressure (BP), and an eGFR >_30 mL/min/1.73 m [2] . A
washout period of at least 36 h after ACE-I therapy is required in
order to minimize the risk of angioedema.
[Practical guidance on how to use ARNI is given in Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)

5.3.5 Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors
The DAPA-HF trial investigated the long-term effects of dapagliflozin
(SGLT2 inhibitor) compared to placebo in addition to optimal medical therapy (OMT), on morbidity and mortality in patients with ambulatory HFrEF. [108] Patients participated in the trial if they were in
NYHA class II�IV, and had an LVEF <_40% despite OMT. Patients
were also required to have an elevated plasma NT-proBNP and an
eGFR >_30 mL/min/1.73 m [2] . [108]

Therapy with dapagliflozin resulted in a 26% reduction in the primary endpoint: a composite of worsening HF (hospitalization or an
urgent visit resulting in i.v. therapy for HF) or CV death. Both of these
components were significantly reduced. Moreover, dapagliflozin
reduced all-cause mortality, [108] alleviated HF symptoms, improved
physical function and QOL in patients with symptomatic HFrEF. [132]

Benefits were seen early after the initiation of dapagliflozin, and the
absolute risk reduction was large. Survival benefits were seen to the
same extent in patients with HFrEF with and without diabetes, and
across the whole spectrum of HbA1c values. [108]

Subsequently, the EMPEROR-Reduced trial found that empagliflozin reduced the combined primary endpoint of CV death or HF hos
�
pitalization by 25% in patients with NYHA class II IV symptoms, and
an LVEF <_40% despite OMT. [109] This trial included patients with an
eGFR >20 mL/min/1.73 m [2] and there was also a reduction in the

decline in eGFR in individuals receiving empagliflozin. It was also associated with an improvement in QOL. [133] Although there was not a
significant reduction in CV mortality in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial,
a recent meta-analysis of the DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced trials found no heterogeneity in CV mortality. [134]

Therefore, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are recommended, in

addition to OMT with an ACE-I/ARNI, a beta-blocker and an MRA,

for patients with HFrEF regardless of diabetes status. The diuretic/
natriuretic properties of SGLT2 inhibitors may offer additional benefits in reducing congestion and may allow a reduction in loop diuretic
requirement. [135]

The combined SGLT-1 and 2 inhibitor, sotagliflozin, has also been
studied in patients with diabetes who were hospitalized with HF. The
drug reduced CV death and hospitalization for HF. [136] It is discussed
further in the AHF and comorbidity sections.
Therapy with SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the risk of recurrent
genital fungal infections. A small reduction in eGFR following initiation

5.4.3 I f -channel inhibitor
Ivabradine slows heart rate by inhibition of the I f channel in the sinus
node and is therefore only effective in patients in SR. Ivabradine
reduced the combined endpoint of CV mortality and HF hospitalization in patients with symptomatic HFrEF with an LVEF <_35%, with HF
hospitalization in recent 12 months, in sinus rhythm (SR) and with a
heart rate >_70 b.p.m. who were on evidence-based therapy including
an ACE-I (or ARB), a beta-blocker, and an MRA. [139][,][140] Our recommendation is based on the heart rate of >_70 b.p.m. used in the SHIFT
trial. However, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved
ivabradine for use in Europe in patients with HFrEF with LVEF <_35%
and in SR with a resting heart rate >_75 b.p.m., because in this group
ivabradine conferred a survival benefit [148] based on a retrospective
subgroup analysis. Every effort should be made to commence and
uptitrate beta-blocker therapy to guideline recommended/maximally
tolerated doses prior to considering ivabradine.
Practical guidance on how to use ivabradine is given in
[Supplementary Table 8.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)

5.4.4 Combination of hydralazine and isosorbide

dinitrate

There is no clear evidence to suggest the use of this fixed-dose combination therapy in all patients with HFrEF. A small RCT conducted in
self-identified black patients showed that an addition of the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate to conventional therapy
(an ACE-I, a beta-blocker, and an MRA) reduced mortality and HF
hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF and NYHA classes III�IV. [142]

These results are difficult to translate to patients of other racial or
ethnic origins.
Additionally, a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate
may be considered in symptomatic patients with HFrEF who cannot
tolerate any of an ACE-I, ARNI, or an ARB (or if they are contraindicated) to reduce mortality. However, this recommendation is based
on the results of the relatively small Veterans Administration
Cooperative Study, which included only male patients with symptomatic HFrEF who were treated with digoxin and diuretics. [143]

5.4.5 Digoxin
Digoxin may be considered in patients with HFrEF in SR to reduce
the risk of hospitalization, [144] although its effect on those routinely

treated with beta-blockers has not been tested. In the DIG trial, the

overall effect on mortality with digoxin was neutral.
The effects of digoxin in patients with HFrEF and AF have not been
studied in RCTs. Some studies have suggested a potentially higher
risk of events in patients with AF receiving digoxin, [149][,][150] whereas
another meta-analysis concluded, on the basis of non-RCTs, that
digoxin has no deleterious effect on mortality in patients with AF and
HF, most of whom had HFrEF. [151] Therefore, in patients with symptomatic HF and AF, digoxin may be useful for the treatment of patients
with HFrEF and AF with rapid ventricular rate, when other therapeutic options cannot be pursued. [150][,][152][�][155]

Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic window and so levels should be
checked aiming for a serum digoxin concentration <1.2 ng/mL. [156][,][157]

Caution should also be exercised when using it in females, the elderly,
frail, hypokalaemic, and malnourished subjects. In patients with
reduced renal function, digitoxin could be considered. Digitoxin use
in HF and SR is currently being investigated. [158]

c The ARBs with evidence in HFrEF are candesartan, losartan, and valsartan.

5.4.1 Diuretics

Loop diuretics are recommended to reduce the signs and/or symptoms of congestion in patients with HFrEF. The quality of the evidence regarding diuretics is poor and their effects on morbidity and
mortality have not been studied in RCTs. However, it should also be
remembered that the major disease-modifying treatment trials for
HFrEF were conducted with a high background use of loop diuretic
therapy. One meta-analysis has shown that in patients with HFrEF,
loop and thiazide diuretics appear to reduce the risk of death and
worsening HF compared with a placebo, and compared with an
active control, diuretics improve exercise capacity. [137]

Loop diuretics produce a more intense and shorter diuresis than
thiazides, although they act synergistically (sequential nephron blockade) and the combination may be used to treat diuretic resistance.
However, adverse effects are more likely, and these combinations
should only be used with care. Of note, ARNI, MRAs, and SGLT2
inhibitors may also possess diuretic properties. [129][,][145]

The aim of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia
with the lowest diuretic dose. In some euvolaemic/hypovolaemic
patients, the use of a diuretic drug might be reduced or discontinued. [146] Patients should be trained to self-adjust their diuretic dose
based on monitoring of symptoms/signs of congestion and daily
weight measurements.
Practical guidance on how to use diuretics is given in
[Supplementary Table 7.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)

5.4.2 Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers
The place of ARBs in the management of HFrEF has changed over
the last few years. They are now recommended for patients who can
not tolerate ACE-I or ARNI because of serious side effects.

Candesartan in the CHARM-Alternative study reduced CV deaths
and HF hospitalizations in patients who were not receiving an ACE-I
due to previous intolerance. [138] Valsartan, in addition to usual therapy,
including ACE-I, reduced HF hospitalizations in the Val-HeFT trial. [147]

However, no ARB has reduced all-cause mortality in any trial.

Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator
The VICTORIA study assessed the efficacy and safety of the oral
soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, vericiguat, in patients with a
reduced EF and recently decompensated CHF. The incidence of
the primary endpoint of death from CV causes or hospitalization
for HF was lower among those who received vericiguat than
among those who received placebo. [141] There was no reduction in
either all-cause or CV mortality. Thus, vericiguat may be considered, in addition to standard therapy for HFrEF, to reduce the risk
of CV mortality and hospitalizations for HF.

rate of tachyarrhythmias and sudden death, but they do not reduce
overall mortality, [161] and may increase it.

Recommendations for an implantable cardioverterdefibrillator in patients with heart failure


Cardiac myosin activator
The GALACTIC-HF study assessed the efficacy and safety of the cardiac myosin activator, omecamtiv mecarbil, in HFrEF patients, enrolling patients in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. The primary
endpoint of a first HF event or CV death was reduced by 8%. There
was no significant reduction in CV mortality. Currently, this drug is
not licensed for use in HF. However, in the future it may be able to
be considered, in addition to standard therapy for HFrEF to reduce
the risk of CV mortality and hospitalization for HF. [159]

with Class I and IIa Mortality/Hospitalization indications) are depicted
in Figure 3. The effect of some interventions on symptoms/QOL are

### 6 Cardiac rhythm management for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

This section provides recommendations on the use of implantable
cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Other implantable devices will be discussed at the end of

this section.

6.1 Implantable cardioverterdefibrillator

A high proportion of deaths among patients with HF, especially in
those with milder symptoms, occur suddenly and unexpectedly.
Many of these may be due to electrical disturbances, including ventricular arrhythmias, bradycardia, and asystole, although some are
due to other acute vascular events. Treatments that improve or delay
the progression of CV disease have been shown to reduce the annual
rate of sudden death, [105][,][160] but they do not treat arrhythmic events
when they occur. ICDs are effective at correcting potentially lethal
ventricular arrhythmias, and in the case of transvenous systems, also

decision to implant should take into account the patient’s view and
their QOL, the LVEF (survival benefit is uncertain when LVEF >35%)
and the absence of other diseases likely to cause death within the following year. [162][�][164][,][184]

6.1.2 Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death
In an analysis of over 40 000 patients from 12 pivotal HF trials, rates
of sudden cardiac death decreased by 44% over the 20-year period
(from the mid-1990s to 2015). [160] This is almost certainly due to
advances in HF treatment, as many key guideline-recommended
therapies, including beta-blockers, MRAs, sacubitril/valsartan, and
CRT pacemakers (CRT-P), reduce the risk of sudden death. While
the afore-mentioned HF therapies have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF, amiodarone has not. [161] However, if it is
to be used, it should be with caution due to its significant side-effect
profile. Conversely, dronedarone [185] and the class I antiarrhythmic
agents disopyramide, encainide, and flecainide [186] should not be used
for prevention of arrhythmias due to the increase in mortality seen in

clinical studies.

Although an ICD reduces the rate of sudden arrhythmic death in
patients with HFrEF, [187] it would be expected that, in well-managed
patients, the additional benefit afforded by an ICD would be lower. In
the DANISH trial, rates of sudden death were low in patients with nonischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM); only 70 patients out of 1116 followed up over 5 years had sudden death. [166] Whilst there was a modest
absolute reduction in sudden death with a defibrillator-containing
device, this did not significantly improve the overall risk of mortality.
However, subgroup analysis suggested there was a benefit in those <_70
years. [188] In a recent meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of
ICDs in NICM a survival benefit was still seen, although the effect was
significantly weakened by the inclusion of the DANISH trial. [167]

On average, patients with IHD are at greater risk of sudden death
than patients with NICM and therefore, although the relative benefits
are similar, the absolute benefit is greater in patients with IHD. [187] Two
RCTs showed no benefit in patients who had an ICD implanted within
40 days after a MI. [177][,][178] Although sudden arrhythmic deaths were
reduced, this was balanced by an increase in non-arrhythmic deaths.
Accordingly, an ICD for primary prevention is contraindicated in this
time period. Furthermore, ICD implantation is recommended only if a

minimum of 3 months of OMT has failed to increase the LVEF to

>35%. OMT ideally includes the use of Class I recommended drugs for
HFrEF. However, the ICD trials we cite predate the use of ARNI and
SGLT2 inhibitors. Whether implantation of ICDs reduces mortality in
those with an LVEF >35% is unknown. There is an ongoing trial of ICD
therapy in such patients with the presence of scar on CMR imaging. [189]

6.1.3 Patient selection for implantable cardioverterdefibrillator therapy
Patients with HFrEF and a QRS duration >_130 ms can be considered

for CRT with a defibrillator (CRT-D) rather than ICD. See the secsection 6.2 . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


In patients with moderate or severe HF, a reduction in sudden
death may be partially or wholly offset by an increase in death due to
worsening HF. [161] As such, ICD therapy is not recommended in
patients in NYHA class IV, with severe symptoms refractory to pharmacological therapy, who are not candidates for a ventricular assist
device (VAD) or cardiac transplantation. Such patients have a very
limited life expectancy and are likely to die from pump failure.
Similarly, patients with serious comorbidities who are unlikely to survive substantially more than 1 year with good QOL are unlikely to
obtain substantial benefit from an ICD. [179][�][183]

Although the DANISH trial did not show a significant benefit from
ICD therapy in patients with NICM, it should be remembered that
NICM is a heterogeneous condition, and certain subgroups (e.g. laminopathies, sarcoidosis) are at higher risk of sudden death and therefore merit careful consideration of ICD implantation. Tools to help
risk stratification (e.g. scar burden on magnetic resonance imaging)
can be helpful in that regard. [190][�][192]

Patients should be counselled as to the purpose of an ICD and
involved in the decision-making process. They should also be aware of
the potential complications related to implantation, any additional implications for driving, and the risk of inappropriate shocks. Furthermore,
patients should be informed about the circumstances where the defibrillator (or defibrillator component of a CRT-D) might be deactivated
(e.g. terminal disease) or explanted (e.g. infection or recovery of LV
function). [193] Subsequent timely conversations regarding defibrillator
deactivation should be held with the patient and caregiver(s).
When an ICD generator reaches its end of life or requires explantation, it should not be replaced automatically. Rather, shared decision making should be undertaken. [168][�][172] Patients should be
carefully evaluated by an experienced cardiologist as treatment goals
may have changed since implantation (the risk of fatal arrhythmia
may be lower, or the risk of non-arrhythmic death may be higher).
It is a matter of some controversy whether patients whose
LVEF has greatly improved and who have not required device therapy during the lifetime of the ICD should have another device
implanted. [168][�][172]

6.1.4 Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
programming
Routine defibrillation threshold testing is no longer performed following implantation of an ICD or CRT-D as it does not improve
shock efficacy or reduce arrhythmic death. [194] Conservative programming with long delays [195] between detection and the ICD delivering
therapy dramatically reduces the risk of both inappropriate and
appropriate but unnecessary shocks. [194][,][196][,][197] Generally, for primary
prevention, defibrillators are programmed to minimize pacing (e.g.
ventricular demand pacing VVI at 40/min), and with a tachycardia
treatment zone >200/min. [194][,][198] Ultimately—and particularly for
secondary prevention—programming should be adapted according
to the patient’s specific needs.

6.1.5 Subcutaneous and wearable implantable

cardioverter-defibrillators

Subcutaneous ICDs (S-ICDs) appear to be as effective as conventional transvenous ICDs with a similar complication rate. Although
the risk of inappropriate shocks appeared to be higher initially,


6.1.2 Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death
In an analysis of over 40 000 patients from 12 pivotal HF trials, rates
of sudden cardiac death decreased by 44% over the 20-year period
(from the mid-1990s to 2015). [160] This is almost certainly due to
advances in HF treatment, as many key guideline-recommended
therapies, including beta-blockers, MRAs, sacubitril/valsartan, and
CRT pacemakers (CRT-P), reduce the risk of sudden death. While
the afore-mentioned HF therapies have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with HFrEF, amiodarone has not. [161] However, if it is
to be used, it should be with caution due to its significant side-effect
profile. Conversely, dronedarone [185] and the class I antiarrhythmic
agents disopyramide, encainide, and flecainide [186] should not be used
for prevention of arrhythmias due to the increase in mortality seen in

clinical studies.

Although an ICD reduces the rate of sudden arrhythmic death in
patients with HFrEF, [187] it would be expected that, in well-managed
patients, the additional benefit afforded by an ICD would be lower. In
the DANISH trial, rates of sudden death were low in patients with nonischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM); only 70 patients out of 1116 followed up over 5 years had sudden death. [166] Whilst there was a modest
absolute reduction in sudden death with a defibrillator-containing

However, subgroup analysis suggested there was a benefit in those <_70
years. [188] In a recent meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of
ICDs in NICM a survival benefit was still seen, although the effect was
significantly weakened by the inclusion of the DANISH trial. [167]

On average, patients with IHD are at greater risk of sudden death
than patients with NICM and therefore, although the relative benefits
are similar, the absolute benefit is greater in patients with IHD. [187] Two
RCTs showed no benefit in patients who had an ICD implanted within
40 days after a MI. [177][,][178] Although sudden arrhythmic deaths were
reduced, this was balanced by an increase in non-arrhythmic deaths.
Accordingly, an ICD for primary prevention is contraindicated in this
time period. Furthermore, ICD implantation is recommended only if a

minimum of 3 months of OMT has failed to increase the LVEF to

>35%. OMT ideally includes the use of Class I recommended drugs for

SGLT2 inhibitors. Whether implantation of ICDs reduces mortality in
those with an LVEF >35% is unknown. There is an ongoing trial of ICD
therapy in such patients with the presence of scar on CMR imaging. [189]


6.1.3 Patient selection for implantable cardioverterdefibrillator therapy
Patients with HFrEF and a QRS duration >_130 ms can be considered

for CRT with a defibrillator (CRT-D) rather than ICD. See the section on CRT for further details (section 6.2).

ESC Guidelines 3627


improved patient selection has shown S-ICDs are non-inferior to
transvenous ICDs in this regard. [199][�][202] They may be the preferred
option for patients with difficult venous access or those who require
ICD explantation due to infection. Patients must be carefully
selected, as S-ICDs cannot treat bradyarrhythmia (except post-shock
pacing) and cannot deliver either anti-tachycardia pacing or CRT.
Substantial RCTs with these devices and more long-term data on
safety and efficacy are awaited.
A wearable cardioverter-defibrillator that is able to recognize
and treat ventricular arrhythmias may be considered for a limited
period of time in selected patients with HF who are at high risk

for sudden death but otherwise are not suitable for ICD
implantation. [162,175,176][,][203] However, the large VEST trial failed to
show that the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator reduced arrhythmic death in patients with an LVEF <_35% following a recent acute
MI. [204]

ICD we refer the reader to the ESC/European Heart Rhythm
Association (EHRA) Guidelines on ventricular tachyarrhythmias and
sudden cardiac death. [201]

b Level of evidence.

In appropriately selected individuals, CRT reduces morbidity and
mortality. [211] Furthermore, CRT improves cardiac function, and
enhances QOL. [209][,][225]

Whilst the CARE-HF [206][,][208] and COMPANION [210] trials compared
the effect of CRT with medical therapy (MT), the majority of CRT
studies have compared CRT-D with ICD, and a few have compared
CRT-P with backup pacing. The prevention of fatal bradycardia might
be an important mechanism of benefit shared by all pacing devices. In
CARE-HF, at baseline, 25% of patients had a resting heart rate of <_60
b.p.m. [206][,][208][,][209] If prevention of bradycardia is important, the effect of
CRT will appear greater in trials where there is no device in the control group. However, in MADIT-II, 35% of those who died with an
ICD did so suddenly even though they were protected from both
brady- and tachyarrhythmia. [226]

Most studies of CRT have specified that the LVEF should be <_35%,
but RAFT [212] and MADIT-CRT [213][,][214] specified an LVEF <_30%, while
REVERSE [207][,][215][,][227] specified <_40% and BLOCK-HF [216] <_50%.
Relatively few patients with an LVEF of 35�40% have been randomized, but an IPD meta-analysis suggests no diminution of the effect of
CRT in this group. [211]

Assessing the ‘response’ to CRT is challenging. Indeed, many who
do not appear to ‘respond’ favourably in terms of their symptoms or
LV function may well have experienced the mortality benefit. Several
characteristics predict improvement in morbidity and mortality. The
extent of reverse remodelling is one of the most important mechanisms of action of CRT. Patients with HFrEF of an ischaemic aetiology
have less improvement in LV function due to myocardial scar tissue,
which is less likely to undergo favourable remodelling. [228] Conversely,
women may be more likely to respond than men, possibly due to
smaller body and heart size. [220][,][224][,][229] QRS width predicts CRT
response and was the inclusion criterion in all randomized trials, [211]

but QRS morphology has also been related to a beneficial response
to CRT. Several studies have shown that patients with left bundle
branch block (LBBB) morphology are more likely to respond favourably to CRT, whereas there is less certainty about patients with nonLBBB morphology. [230] This latter group is also underrepresented in
the large CRT trials. [206][,][210][,][213] However, patients with LBBB

morphology often have wider QRS durations, and there is a current
debate about whether QRS durations or QRS morphology is the
main predictor of a beneficial response to CRT. Evidence from two
IPD meta-analyses indicates that after accounting for QRS duration,
there is little evidence to suggest that QRS morphology or aetiology
of disease influence the effect of CRT on morbidity or mortality. [211][,][220] In addition, none of the landmark trials selected patients for
inclusion according to QRS morphology, sex, or ischaemic aetiology,
nor were they powered for subgroup analyses.
The Echo-CRT trial [222][,][223] and an IPD meta-analysis [213] suggest possible harm from CRT when QRS duration is <130 ms, thus implantation of CRT is not recommended if QRS duration is <130 ms.

If a patient is scheduled to receive an ICD and is in SR, with a
LBBB, CRT-D should be considered if the QRS is between 130

and 149 ms and is recommended if QRS is >_150 ms. However,

clinical practice varies widely among countries and if the primary
reason for implanting CRT is for the relief of symptoms, then the
clinician should choose CRT-P or CRT-D, whichever they consider appropriate. The only randomized trial to compare CRT-P
and CRT-D [210] did not demonstrate a difference in morbidity or
mortality between these technologies (although the trial was not
powered to show such a difference). Furthermore, in the
DANISH study in patients with NICM where 58% of patients
received CRT there was no suggestion from subgroup analysis
that CRT-P was inferior to CRT-D. [166][,][167]

When LVEF is reduced, RV pacing may exacerbate cardiac dyssynchrony. This can be prevented by CRT, which might improve patient
outcomes. [216][�][218][,][231] However, a difference in outcome was not

observed between CRT and RV pacing in a subgroup analysis of
RAFT. [212] On balance, CRT rather than RV pacing is recommended
for patients with HFrEF regardless of NYHA class who have an indication for ventricular pacing in order to reduce morbidity, although
no clear effect on mortality was observed. Patients with HFrEF who
have received a conventional pacemaker or an ICD and subsequently
develop worsening HF with a high proportion of RV pacing, despite
OMT, should be considered for ‘upgrading’ to CRT.
Only two small trials have compared pharmacological therapy
alone vs. CRT in patients with AF, with conflicting results. Several
studies have indicated that CRT is superior to RV pacing in patients
undergoing atrio-ventricular (AV) node ablation. [217][,][218][,][231]

However, AF is not an indication to carry out AV node ablation in
patients with CRT except in a few cases when ventricular rate
remains persistently high despite attempts at pharmacological rate
control. A subgroup analysis of patients with AF from the RAFT
study found no benefit from CRT-D compared with ICD, although
less than half of patients had >90% biventricular capture. [219] In view
of the paucity of evidence for the efficacy of CRT in patients with
AF, it may be an option in selected patients—particularly those
with a QRS >_150 ms—ensuring a proportion of biventricular pacing as high as possible.
Observational studies report that when biventricular capture is
<98%, the prognosis of patients with CRT declines. [218][,][232] Whether
this association reflects a loss of resynchronization (which might be
remedied by device programming), poor placement of the LV lead,
or greater difficulty in pacing severely diseased myocardium is uncertain. This observation has not been confirmed in any randomized
trial. . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Early studies suggested that imaging tests for dyssynchrony were
not of value in selecting patients for CRT. [233] However, a recent study
has suggested that two novel markers of dyssynchrony (apical rocking and septal flash) are associated with a response to CRT, but these
have not been tested as selection criteria or as prespecified subgroups in a randomized trial. [234] Patients with extensive myocardial
scar will have less improvement in LV function with CRT, but this is
true of any treatment for HFrEF and does not reliably predict less
clinical benefit. Pacing thresholds are higher in scarred myocardium
and, if possible, lead placement should avoid such regions. [235][,][236]

Although patients with extensive scarring have an intrinsically worse
prognosis, there is little evidence that they obtain less prognostic
benefit from CRT. [211]

The value of trying to optimize AV intervals or interventricular
delay intervals (VV intervals) after implantation using echo- or electrocardiographic criteria or BP response is uncertain but may be considered for patients who have had a disappointing response to
CRT. [237][,][238] Other options to consider to optimize response to CRT
are covered in a recently published practical article. [239]

Following CRT implantation, a review of diuretic therapy is advised
as a reduction in dose or its discontinuation may be required. In addition, CRT implantation may afford an opportunity to further optimize
MT for HFrEF. [240]

The reader is directed to guidelines on pacing and CRT for recommendations on device implantation procedures. [240a]

6.3 Devices under evaluation

Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) has been evaluated in

�
patients with NYHA class III IV HF, with an LVEF >_25% to <_45%
and QRS duration <130 ms, and was associated with a small improvement in exercise tolerance and QOL. [241][,][242]

Technologies that involve modification of the activity of the autonomic nervous system, e.g. baroreflex activation therapy, [243][,][244] have
also been shown to offer a modest improvement in effort capacity
and QOL. However, currently, the evidence is considered insufficient
to support specific guideline recommendations for a reduction in
mortality or hospitalization for these and a variety of other implantable electrical therapeutic technologies (see also Gaps in Evidence in
section 16).
### 7 Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction

7.1 The diagnosis of heart failure with
mildly reduced ejection fraction
The diagnosis of HFmrEF requires the presence of symptoms and/or

�
signs of HF, and a mildly reduced EF (41 49%) The presence of elevated NPs (BNP >_35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP >_125 pg/mL) and other
evidence of structural heart disease [e.g. increased left atrial (LA) size,
LVH or echocardiographic measures of LV filling] make the diagnosis
more likely but are not mandatory for diagnosis if there is certainty
regarding the measurement of LVEF.
An algorithm for the diagnosis of HFmrEF is depicted in Figure 1.
For the investigation of the underlying aetiology, please refer to
Table 5 (which refers to investigations regardless of LVEF).

7.2 Clinical characteristics of patients
with heart failure with mildly reduced
ejection fraction
There is a substantial overlap of clinical characteristics, risk factors,
patterns of cardiac remodelling, and outcomes among the LVEF categories in HF. Patients with HFmrEF have, on average, features that
are more similar to HFrEF than HFpEF, in that they are more commonly men, younger, and are more likely to have CAD

�
(50 60%), [38][,][42][,][43] and less likely to have AF and non-cardiac comor[bidities (Supplementary Table 10). However, ambulatory patients with](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
HFmrEF have a lower mortality than those with HFrEF, more akin to
those with HFpEF.
Patients with HFmrEF may include patients whose LVEF has
improved from <_40% or declined from >_50%. [50]

7.3 Treatments for patients with heart
failure with mildly reduced ejection
fraction

As in other forms of HF, diuretics should be used to control congestion. No substantial prospective RCT has been performed exclusively
[in patients with HFmrEF (Supplementary Table 11). Some data can be](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
gleaned from subgroup analysis of trials in HFpEF, none of which
have met their primary endpoint. Although strong recommendations
cannot be made about specific therapies at this point in time, we have
included a Table of Recommendations to help guide the management
of patients in this category.

7.3.1 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
There are no specific trials of ACE-I in patients with HFmrEF.
Although, the PEP-CHF trial was conducted in patients with HFpEF
and included patients with an LVEF >40%, it did not report outcomes
according to LVEF. [11]

However, in patients with HFmrEF, many will also have CAD,
hypertension, or post-MI LV systolic dysfunction and will, therefore,
already be treated with ACE-I.
Therefore, ACE-I use may be considered in patients with HFmrEF.

7.3.2 Angiotensin receptor II type 1 receptor blockers
There are no specific trials of ARBs in HFmrEF. The CHARMPreserved trial missed its primary endpoint of CV death or HF hospitalizations. [245] However, a retrospective analysis showed that candesartan reduced the number of patients hospitalized for HF among
those with HFmrEF (with similar trends for CV and all-cause mortality). [8] Moreover, a recurrent-event analysis suggested a reduction in
hospitalizations for HF among the entire CHARM-Preserved cohort,
including those with HFmrEF. [248]

As for ACE-I, many with HFmrEF will already be on an ARB for
other CV indications. Therefore, treatment with ARBs may be considered in patients with HFmrEF.

7.3.3 Beta-blockers

There is no specific trial of beta-blockade in HFmrEF. An IPD metaanalysis of landmark trials of beta-blockers suggested similar reductions in CV and all-cause mortality (of 50%) for patients in SR with
HFrEF and HFmrEF. [12] This IPD meta-analysis included the SENIORS
trial where nebivolol reduced the composite primary endpoint of allcause mortality or CV hospital admissions in the overall population.
No interaction between LVEF (35% of patients had an LVEF of
35�50%) and the effect of nebivolol on the primary outcome was
observed. [119][,][249] Many patients with HFmrEF may have another CV
indication, such as AF or angina, for a beta-blocker. Therefore, treatment with beta-blockers may be considered in patients with HFmrEF.

7.3.4 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
There is no specific trial of MRAs in HFmrEF. In a retrospective analysis of the TOPCAT trial in patients with an LVEF >_45%, [9] spironolactone reduced hospitalizations for HF in those with an LVEF <55%.
There was a similar trend for CV but not all-cause mortality.
Treatment with an MRA may be considered in patients with

HFmrEF.

7.3.5 Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor
There is no specific trial of ARNI in HFmrEF. In the PARAGON-HF
trial, which included patients with EF >_45%, although the trial missed
its primary endpoint overall, a significant EF-by-treatment interaction
was observed. Sacubitril/valsartan, compared with valsartan, reduced
the likelihood of the primary composite outcome of CV death and
total HF hospitalizations by 22% in those with an EF below or equal
to the median of 57%. [13] Further data are available from a combined

analysis of the PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF trials showing
that sacubitril/valsartan, compared to other forms of RAAS blockade,
has a beneficial effect, especially on hospitalizations for HF in those
with HFmrEF. [247]

In the DIG trial, [10] for those with HFmrEF in SR, there was a trend to

fewer hospitalizations for HF in those assigned to digoxin, but no
reduction in mortality and a trend to an excess of CV deaths.

Therefore, there are insufficient data to recommend its use.

There are also insufficient data on ivabradine in HFmrEF to draw

any conclusions.

7.3.7 Devices

While post hoc analyses of landmark CRT trials suggest that CRT
may benefit patients with LVEF >35%, trials of CRT for HFmrEF were
abandoned due to poor recruitment. [250] There are no substantial trials of ICDs for primary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias for
HFmrEF; trials conducted more than 20 years ago suggested no benefit from ICD implantation for secondary prevention of ventricular
arrhythmias for HFmrEF.

Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to advise CRT or ICD

therapy in patients with HFmrEF.
In HF patients with an LVEF >_40%, the implantation of an interatrial shunt device was found to be safe, and this device is subject to
investigation in a larger study before any recommendation on their
use in HFpEF or HFmrEF can be given. [251]
### 8 Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

8.1 The background to heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction
This guideline acknowledges the historical changes in nomenclature
and the lack of consensus on the optimal LVEF cut-off to define the
group of patients with HF without overtly reduced EF. The term ‘preserved’ was originally proposed in the Candesartan in Heart failure:
Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity (CHARM)
Programme to refer to patients with an EF (>40%) that was not
clearly ‘reduced’ or completely ‘normal’. [252] While the current guide
�
lines have designated patients with an LVEF 41 49% as HFmrEF, we
recognize that there will be debate about what constitutes ‘mildly
reduced’ EF, what these EF cut-offs should be, and whether they
should be different for men and women. [14][,][253] The EACVI defines systolic dysfunction as being <52% for males and <54% for females. [16]

Whether patients with higher EFs and HF should be named HF
with ‘normal’ EF has also been considered. [14][,][254] However, given the
known variability of echocardiographic measurements of LVEF, the
difficulties in interpreting LVEF measured using different imaging
modalities, and remaining controversies regarding the precise LVEF
cut-off to define ‘normal’, which may vary not only with sex but also
with other factors such as age and ethnicity, [255] this guideline has kept
the nomenclature of HFpEF using an EF cut-off of 50%. Importantly,

clinicians should be aware that LVEF is a continuous variable with a

normal distribution in the general population, and the EF cut-offs
used in definitions are therefore arbitrary. Moreover, while the LVEF

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


�
of a very high EF (e.g. above 65 70%) should also prompt a search
for pathology, such as cardiac amyloidosis (CA) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), where a ‘supra-normal’ EF may result from
shrinkage of the LV end-diastolic volume (denominator of EF). [256][,][257]

8.2 Clinical characteristics of patients
with heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction

HFpEF differs from HFrEF and HFmrEF in that HFpEF patients are

older and more often female. AF, CKD, and non-CV comorbidities

are more common in patients with HFpEF than in those with
HFrEF. [258]

There are numerous potential causes of HFpEF (Table 5). The
pathophysiology of various HFpEF syndromes differs, and thus they
require distinct therapies. Red flags for the potential presence of CA
include low normal BP in patients with a history of hypertension,
intolerance to beta-blockers or ACE-I, history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, low voltage on ECG and echocardiographic features
such as thickening of the septum, posterior wall, or RV wall, enlarged
atria, a small pericardial effusion, or valve thickening [for more details
see the section on CMP (section 14.2)]. Furthermore, it is important
to exclude other conditions that might mimic the HFpEF syndrome
(e.g. lung disease, anaemia, obesity, and deconditioning). For a more
comprehensive overview on HFpEF, see the ESC/HFA position
statement. [259]

8.3 The diagnosis of heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction
The diagnosis of HFpEF remains challenging. Several diagnostic criteria
have been proposed by societies and in clinical trials. [260] These criteria
vary widely in their sensitivities and specificities for diagnosing HFpEF.
More recently, two score-based algorithms (H 2 FPEF and HFA-PEFF)
have been proposed to aid the diagnosis. [259][,][261] While the generalizability of the scores has been tested in various trial and observational
cohorts, their diagnostic performance has varied. [262][�][269]

Both scores assign a substantial proportion of suspected HFpEF
patients as intermediate likelihood, wherein additional diagnostics are
proposed. Thus, depending on which score is used, different patients
will be referred for additional testing or allocated as having HFpEF.
Furthermore, physicians may not have access to all the specialized
tests recommended by the specific diagnostic algorithms. This limits
the broad clinical applicability of the scores and demonstrates the
ongoing diagnostic uncertainty in HFpEF. [267]

To facilitate broad clinical application, this guideline recommends a simplified pragmatic approach that distils the common
major elements in prior diagnostic criteria and emphasizes the
most frequently used variables widely available to clinicians. Some
of these variables, in particular, LA size (LA volume index
>32 mL/m [2] ), mitral E velocity >90 cm/s, septal e [0] velocity <9 cm/s,
E/e [0] ratio >9 have been shown to be pivot points beyond which
the risk of CV mortality is increased, underscoring their value. [270]

This recommendation is therefore consistent with the consensus

document of the HFA, and does not represent a new algorithm
or diagnostic score but rather a simplified approach. Physicians
with access to expertise may refer to the full diagnostic approach
recommended by the HFA. [259]


7.3.6 Other drugs
In the DIG trial, [10] for those with HFmrEF in SR, there was a trend to

fewer hospitalizations for HF in those assigned to digoxin, but no
reduction in mortality and a trend to an excess of CV deaths.

Therefore, there are insufficient data to recommend its use.

There are also insufficient data on ivabradine in HFmrEF to draw

any conclusions.


7.3.7 Devices

While post hoc analyses of landmark CRT trials suggest that CRT
may benefit patients with LVEF >35%, trials of CRT for HFmrEF were
abandoned due to poor recruitment. [250] There are no substantial trials of ICDs for primary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias for
HFmrEF; trials conducted more than 20 years ago suggested no benefit from ICD implantation for secondary prevention of ventricular
arrhythmias for HFmrEF.

Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to advise CRT or ICD

therapy in patients with HFmrEF.
In HF patients with an LVEF >_40%, the implantation of an interatrial shunt device was found to be safe, and this device is subject to
investigation in a larger study before any recommendation on their
use in HFpEF or HFmrEF can be given. [251]

### 8 Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction


8.1 The background to heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction
This guideline acknowledges the historical changes in nomenclature
and the lack of consensus on the optimal LVEF cut-off to define the
group of patients with HF without overtly reduced EF. The term ‘preserved’ was originally proposed in the Candesartan in Heart failure:

should be different for men and women. [14][,][253] The EACVI defines systolic dysfunction as being <52% for males and <54% for females. [16]

ESC Guidelines 3631


This simplified diagnostic approach starts with assessment of pretest probability (see clinical characteristics above). The diagnosis
should include the following:

(1) Symptoms and signs of HF.

(2) An LVEF >_50%.*

(3) Objective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnor
malities consistent with the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction/

raised LV filling pressures, including raised NPs (Table 9).

*Of note, patients with a history of overtly reduced LVEF (<_40%),
who later present with LVEF >_50%, should be considered to have
recovered HFrEF or ‘HF with improved LVEF’ (rather than HFpEF).
Continued treatment for HFrEF is recommended in these patients. [271]

It is not known whether starting HF therapy in patients with recovered LVEF is beneficial. Patients with HFpEF tend to have stable trajectory of LVEF over time. [272] However, in those who develop a
clinical indication for a repeat echo during follow-up, around one
third have a decline in LVEF. [273]

In the presence of AF, the threshold for LA volume index is >40
mL/m [2] . Exercise stress thresholds include E/e [0] ratio at peak stress >_15
or tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity at peak stress >3.4 m/s. [275] LV
global longitudinal strain <16% has a sensitivity of 62% and a specificity
of 56% for the diagnosis of HFpEF by invasive testing. [261]

The approach to the diagnosis should involve additional confirmatory tests in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, such as cardiopulmonary
exercise testing (to confirm a reduction in exercise capacity and to
help differentiate the cause of dyspnoea), exercise stress testing, and
invasive haemodynamic testing. [259]

If resting echocardiographic and laboratory markers are equivocal,
a diastolic stress test is recommended. [259][,][274] The confirmatory test
for the diagnosis of HFpEF is invasive haemodynamic exercise testing.
An invasively measured pulmonary capillary wedge pressure

. [....................................................................................................]


end-diastolic pressure >_16 mmHg (at rest) is generally considered
diagnostic. [266] However, instead of an exercise PCWP cut-off, some
have used an index of PCWP to cardiac output for the invasive diagnosis of HFpEF [260][,][276] . Recognizing that invasive haemodynamic exercise testing is not available in many centres worldwide, and is
associated with risks, its main use is limited to the research setting. In
the absence of any disease-modifying treatments, the current guidelines do not mandate gold standard testing in every patient to make
the diagnosis, but emphasize that the greater the number of objective
non-invasive markers of raised LV filling pressures (Table 9), the
higher the probability of a diagnosis of HFpEF.

8.4 Treatment of heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction
To date, no treatment has been shown to convincingly reduce
mortality and morbidity in patients with HFpEF, although improvements have been seen for some specific phenotypes of patients
within the overall HFpEF umbrella. However, none of the large
RCTs conducted in HFpEF have achieved their primary endpoints.
These include PEP-CHF (perindopril), [277] CHARM-Preserved (candesartan), [245] I-PRESERVE (irbesartan), [278] TOPCAT (spironolactone), [246] DIG-Preserved (digoxin), [279] and PARAGON-HF
(sacubitril/valsartan) [13] [(see Supplementary Table 12 for the details](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
about these and additional trials). Hospitalizations for HF were
reduced by candesartan and spironolactone and there was a trend
towards reduction with sacubitril/valsartan, although as these trials
were neutral for their primary endpoints, these are hypothesisgenerating findings only. Although nebivolol significantly reduced
the combined primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or CV hospital admission in the SENIORS trial, this trial included only 15% with
an LVEF >50%. [119][,][249] Trials targeting the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway have also failed to improve exercise

VITALITY-HFpEF, [282] and CAPACITY-HFpEF (praliciguat). [283]

Despite the lack of evidence for specific disease-modifying therapies in HFpEF, as the vast majority of HFpEF patients have underlying
hypertension and/or CAD, many are already treated with ACE-I/
ARB, beta-blockers, or MRAs. In the PARAGON-HF study at baseline, more than 86% of patients were on ACE-I/ARBs, 80% were on
beta-blockers, and more than 24% were on MRAs. [13]

The Task Force acknowledge that the treatment options for
HFpEF are being revised as this guideline is being published. We note
that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has endorsed the use
of sacubitril/valsartan and spironolactone in those with an LVEF ‘less
than normal’. These statements relate to patients within both the
HFmrEF and HFpEF categories. For sacubitril/valsartan, this decision
was based on the subgroup analysis from the PARAGON-HF study,
which showed a reduction in HF hospitalizations in those with an
LVEF <57%, and a meta-analysis of the PARADIGM-HF and
PARAGON-HF studies, showing a reduction in CV death and HF
hospitalization in those with an LVEF below the normal range. [247]

Regarding spironolactone, the subgroup of individuals in the
TOPCAT study recruited in the Americas had a significant reduction in the primary endpoint of CV death and HF hospitalization,
and a subsequent post hoc analysis by EF showed a significant
reduction in outcomes for those with an LVEF <55%. [9][,][247] There are

also ongoing trials with SGLT2 inhibitors. These developments may
well accelerate a redefinition of HFpEF in the future and have therapeutic implications.
In the absence of recommendations regarding disease-modifying
therapies, treatment should be aimed at reducing symptoms of congestion with diuretics. Loop diuretics are preferred, although thiazide
diuretics may be useful for managing hypertension. Reducing body
weight in obese patients and increasing exercise may further improve
symptoms and exercise capacity and should therefore be considered
in appropriate patients. [284][,][285]

It is important to identify and treat the underlying risk factors, aetiology, and coexisting comorbidities in HFpEF (e.g. hypertension in
section 12.4, CAD in section 12.2, amyloidosis in section 14.6, AF in
section 12.1.1, and valvular heart disease in section 12.3).
Undoubtably, treatment of some of the underlying phenotypes of the
the HFpEF syndrome leads to improved outcomes.

system, available resources (infrastructure, facilities, staff, and finances), administrative policies, and tailored to the patient’s needs.
Many patients with HF would derive benefit from the early integration of a palliative and supportive approach within the care provided
by all members of the HF multidisciplinary team. [312][,][313] Palliative and
supportive care should be thought about for all patients with HF,
regardless of stage of their illness. Patients in the advanced stages and
those considered for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) or heart
transplantation should receive a palliative care consultation before
such interventions as a matter of protocol (see section 10.2.4).

9.2.2 Characteristics and components of a heart failure

management programme
Clinical trials have included complex, bundled interventions, making
it difficult to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of each specific component. Table 11 presents an overview of characteristics and

9.3 Patient education, self-care and
lifestyle advice
Adequate patient self-care is essential in the effective management of
HF and allows patients to understand what is beneficial, and to agree
to self-monitoring and management plans. [319] HF patients who report
more effective self-care have a better QOL, lower readmission rates,
and reduced mortality. [309]

Misunderstandings, misconceptions, and lack of knowledge all contribute to insufficient self-care and therefore patient education is vital.
Improving patients’ knowledge of their condition is fundamental for
the development of self-care skills. [304]

Education to improve self-care should be tailored to the individual
patient and based on, where available, scientific evidence or expert
opinion. There is little evidence that specific lifestyle advice improves


9.2 Multidisciplinary management of
chronic heart failure

9.2.1 Models of care
In order to reduce hospitalizations and mortality, earlier guidelines [1]

recommended the use of multidisciplinary HF management
programmes (HF-MPs), which enable patients to have the correct
investigations, an accurate diagnosis, appropriate evidence-based
therapy, education, and suitable follow-up. The optimal implementation of a HF-MP requires a multidisciplinary team that is active along
the whole HF trajectory; from onset, through critical events, periods
of apparent stability, and its terminal stages. [303] Since the 2016 guidelines, new studies have been published that underscore the need for
HF-MPs and reveal more insights into how care can be delivered.
A network meta-analysis including 53 randomized trials published
in 2017, concluded that both disease-management clinics and home
visits by nurses reduced all-cause mortality compared to usual care;
home visits being most effective. [308] An IPD meta-analysis of 20 studies, including 5624 patients, concluded that self-management interventions in HF patients improve outcomes despite heterogeneity in the
intensity, content, and the personnel who deliver the interventions. [309]

HF-MPs vary in their components and can apply different service
models, such as clinic-based approaches (in primary, secondary, or
tertiary care), home-based programmes, case management, or
hybrids of these. Components used in the services vary, e.g. some
HF-MPs use telemonitoring that may be applied at a local, regional,

or national level. No service model has been shown to be consistently superior to others. [310] While home visits and HF clinics do
reduce all-cause admissions and mortality, educational programmes,
used alone, do not. [308][,][309] HF-MPs should be patient-centred and take
a holistic approach to the patient rather than focussing solely on HF;
management of comorbid conditions, such as arrhythmias, hypertension, diabetes, renal dysfunction, and depression, improve patient
well-being and self-management, leading to better outcomes. [309][,][311]

The organization of a HF-MP should be adapted to the healthcare

9.4 Exercise rehabilitation

There is consistent evidence that physical conditioning by exercise
training improves exercise tolerance, and health-related QOL in
patients with HF. Clinical trials and meta-analyses in people with
HFrEF show that exercise rehabilitation improves exercise capacity
and QOL. Several meta-analyses also show that it reduces all-cause
and HF hospitalizations, although uncertainty persists about its effects
on mortality. [322][�][328] The effect on hospitalization is seen in those
who are highly adherent to the exercise programme. [329] Highintensity interval training, in patients who are able and willing,
may improve peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 ). [330][,][331] Supervised

exercise-based rehabilitation should be considered in those who are
frail, who have more severe disease or comorbidities. [95]

Physical conditioning also improves exercise capacity and
QOL. [332][�][335] No data on HFmrEF are available, but benefits

observed in the other groups of HF should also apply to this group.

9.5 Follow-up of chronic heart failure
9.5.1 General follow-up
This is a relatively understudied area. Patients with HF, even if symptoms are well controlled and stable, require follow-up to ensure continued optimization of therapy, to detect asymptomatic progression of
HF or its comorbidities and to discuss any new advances in care. These
guidelines recommend follow-up at intervals no longer than 6 months
to check symptoms, heart rate and rhythm, BP, full blood count, electrolytes, and renal function. For patients recently discharged from hospital, or in those undergoing uptitration of medication, follow-up
intervals should be more frequent. Whether such stable patients need
to be followed-up by cardiologists is uncertain. Some studies suggest
that follow-up in primary care may be appropriate. [303][,][339] However,
uptake of evidence-based interventions is poor in many settings [340][,][104]

and several studies suggest that care and follow-up provided by HF
specialists, and use of quality improvement registries can lead to higher
rates of optimal therapy and improved outcomes. [341][�][343]

An ECG should be done annually to detect QRS prolongation [344]

as such patients may become candidates for CRT. Furthermore, it
may identify conduction disturbances and AF.
Serial echocardiography is generally not necessary, although an
echocardiogram should be repeated if there has been a deterioration
in clinical status. An echocardiogram is also advised 3�6 months after
optimization of standard therapies for HFrEF to determine the need
for addition of newer pharmacological agents and implanted devices.

9.5.2 Monitoring with biomarkers
Trials investigating the use of biomarkers (particularly BNP and/or
NT-proBNP) to guide pharmacotherapy for HFrEF have produced
conflicting results. [345][�][352] They are undoubtedly good prognostic
markers. [72][,][353][,][354] Conceptually, it is not clear what a biomarkersupported strategy might offer in addition to assiduous application of
guideline-recommended therapy. Current evidence, therefore, does
not support the routine measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP to
guide titration of therapy.

9.6 Telemonitoring
Telemonitoring enables patients to provide, remotely, digital health
information to support and optimize their care. Data such as



- [Providing information in a variety of formats that take into]

approaches with active roles for patients and caregivers such as
‘ask-tell-ask’, ‘teach back’, or motivational interviewing. Reinforce

symptoms, weight, heart rate, and BP, can be collected frequently,
stored in an electronic health record and used to guide patients
(directly or through a healthcare professional), to adjust therapy or
to seek further advice. Home telemonitoring (HTM) can help maintain quality of care, facilitate rapid access to care when needed,
. [................]
reduce patient travel costs, and minimize the frequency of clinic visits. [355] Enforced cessation of face-to-face consultations in many countries during the recent COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted some
of the potential advantages of HTM. [356]


Thus, non-invasive HTM may be considered for patients with HF
in order to reduce the risk of recurrent CV and HF hospitalizations
and CV death; further evidence on management guided by implanted
systems is awaited. [374]

### 10 Advanced heart failure

10.1 Epidemiology, diagnosis, and
prognosis
Many patients with HF progress into a phase of advanced HF, characterized by persistent symptoms despite maximal therapy. [375][�][377] The
prevalence of advanced HF is increasing due to the growing number
of patients with HF, ageing of the population, and better treatment
and survival of HF. Prognosis remains poor, with a 1-year mortality
ranging from 25% to 75%. [378][�][380]

The updated HFA-ESC 2018 criteria for the definition of advanced
HF are reported in Table 13. [376] A severely reduced LVEF is common
but not required for a diagnosis of advanced HF as it may develop in
patients with HFpEF as well. In addition to the reported criteria,
extra-cardiac organ dysfunction due to HF (e.g. cardiac cachexia,
liver or kidney dysfunction) or type II pulmonary hypertension
may be present, but are not required for the definition of advanced
HF. [376]

The Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory
Support (INTERMACS) profiles, developed to classify patients
with a potential indication for durable MCS devices, describes
clinical parameters and characteristics consistent with a need for
advanced therapies (Table 14). [381] This classification has also been
shown to be useful in estimating the prognosis of patients undergoing urgent heart transplantation [382] or LV assist device (LVAD)
implantation, [383] and for risk assessment in ambulatory advanced
HF patients. [384]

Prognostic stratification is important to identify the ideal time for
referral to an appropriate centre (i.e. one capable of providing
advanced HF therapies), to properly convey expectations to patients
and families, and to plan treatment and follow-up strategies


Trials of HTM are diverse. Patients are usually required to make
measurements and, as for many other aspects of HF management,
adherence may be incomplete. HTM may be provided as a local,
regional, or national service. Systems that focus on optimizing
management rather than detecting and managing medical emergencies need only to be staffed during standard working hours.
Some systems are designed also to offer support at any time
requested by the patient. The comparative effectiveness and cost
effectiveness of each strategy is uncertain. Systems that focus on
continuous optimization of care (a health maintenance approach)
rather than trying to anticipate and manage episodes of worsening
(a strategy that is plagued by a large number of false-positive
alerts), appear more successful. [357] HTM is an efficient method for
providing patient education and motivation and aiding delivery of
care, but it should be adapted to work in synergy with existing
healthcare provision. [358]

A Cochrane systematic review conducted in 2017 identified 39
relevant trials of HTM, largely based on assessments of symptoms,
weight, heart rate and rhythm, and BP and found that HTM was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality of 20% and HF hospitalization of 37%. [359] Since then, several neutral trials and at least one
positive trial have been published. [357][,][360][�][364] These are unlikely to
change the positive results of the systematic review. Importantly, if
social distancing and the ‘green’ agenda are important, HTM only
needs to show that it is not inferior to contemporary methods of
delivering care to be an appropriate means of supporting care. [356]

Whether wearable technologies for monitoring heart rate and
rhythm or lung congestion (bio-impedance or lung radar) offer addi
tional benefits to conventional HTM described above is
uncertain. [365][�][367]

Many implanted therapeutic devices can provide, wirelessly and
remotely, information either on the device itself (generator and lead
function), arrhythmias, or on patient physiology (heart rate, activity,
heart sounds, bio-impedance). There is strong evidence that monitoring can detect device malfunction earlier than by conventional
monitoring and that it may be useful for detecting arrhythmias such
as AF. However, there is little evidence that device monitoring
reduces admissions for HF or mortality. [368][�][370][,][371]

Devices that only provide a monitoring function are also available.
Implantable loop-recorders can be injected subcutaneously and used
to monitor heart rate and rhythm, activity, and bio-impedance.
Monitoring devices can also be placed in the pulmonary artery to
monitor pressure wirelessly, although the external reader required
to detect the device signal is rather bulky and requires patient cooperation. A rise in diastolic pulmonary artery pressure may be one
of the earliest signs of congestion. A preliminary, but fairly substantial,
trial showed a reduction in the risk of recurrent HF hospitalization. [372]

A much larger trial has completed recruitment (GUIDE-HF). [373]

(Figure 4). [376] Patients with contraindications to MCS or heart transplantation should be considered for palliative care (see section 10.2.4).
[Despite many prognostic parameters (Supplementary Table 13),](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
predicting outcomes remains difficult and patients are often referred
to advanced HF centres too late. Identifying warning signs in patients
with non-advanced symptoms may allow early referral so that MCS
and heart transplantation may be offered before the development of
[end-organ failure (Figure 5; Supplementary Table 14).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data) [376][,][386] An organi
zational model between centres with different levels of care com
plexity, based on a ‘Hub and Spoke’ network is the key to good
patient management. [376]

10.2 Management
In patients with advanced HF, pharmacological therapy and shortterm MCS may be needed until the implantation of long-term MCS
or heart transplantation becomes available.

10.2.1 Pharmacological therapy and renal replacement
Inotropes may improve haemodynamic parameters, reducing congestion, augmenting cardiac output, and aiding peripheral perfusion.
Although not proven, this may help to prevent worsening end-organ
function. Conversely, traditional inotropes may favor myocardial
ischaemia and/or tachyarrhythmias and worsen the clinical
course. [387][,][388] They can be used as palliative therapy for the relief of
symptoms in patients without other treatment options. Intermittent
long-term use of inotropes may be considered in outpatients to
improve functional class and QOL. [389][,][390]

Kidney dysfunction and loop diuretic resistance often characterize
the clinical course of patients with advanced HF. Doubling of the
loop diuretic dose is proposed, in the first instance, followed by concomitant administration of thiazides or metolazone (see section
11.3.3). [145] In patients who fail to respond to diuretic-based strategies,
renal replacement therapies should be considered. Ultrafiltration is

. [...............................................................................................................]


with diuretic resistance even if data about its effects on outcomes are
unsettled. [391][,][392]

10.2.2 Mechanical circulatory support
MCS can improve survival and symptoms of patients with advanced
HF. [376][,][393] The use of MCS should be considered for the different sce
narios listed in Table 15. Indications for short- and long-term MCS
should be based on the INTERMACS profiles (Table 14, Figure 4).

Short-term mechanical circulatory support

Short-term MCS devices are indicated to reverse critical end
organ hypoperfusion and hypoxia in the setting of cardiogenic
shock. They can be used for a short, limited, period of time, from a
few days up to several weeks. The aim is to support the central
nervous system and organ perfusion, to reverse acidosis and
multi-organ failure until the patient’s outcome becomes clearer
be that of cardiac recovery, transition to durable MCS or heart
transplantation, or, in some cases, towards a more palliative
approach. The care of patients on short-term MCS is complex and
requires dedicated expertise including having specific plans for
stopping support when neither cardiac nor brain injury recovers.
Short-term MCS should be used in patients with INTERMACS
profiles 1 or 2 as a bridge to decision (BTD), bridge to recovery
(BTR), bridge to bridge (BTB) for either long-term MCS or urgent
heart transplantation (Figure 4). [394] Further details about shortterm MCS are reported in the Supplementary text 11.4.

Long-term mechanical circulatory support
Long-term MCS is indicated in selected patients when MT is insufficient or when short-term MCS has not led to cardiac recovery or
clinical improvement, to prolong life and improve QOL, or to keep
the patient alive until transplantation (bridge to transplantation, BTT)
or to reverse contraindications to heart transplantation (bridge to
candidacy, BTC), or as destination therapy (DT) (Table 15).
Long-term MCS should be considered in patients with
INTERMACS profiles 2 to 4 and also in patients with INTERMACS

no irreversible end-organ failure other than cardiac, recovering from

transplantation, although adverse events negatively affect QOL.
Among patients with continuous flow LVADs, actuarial survival was
reported of 80% at 1 year and 70% at 2 years. [403][,][404] Two-year survival was 84.5% and survival free of disabling stroke or need of reoperation for LVAD malfunction was 76.9% with a centrifugal-flow
LVAD in MOMENTUM 3. [405] The fully magnetically levitated
centrifugal-flow LVAD has significantly reduced pump thrombosis. In
MOMENTUM 3, the need for reoperation to replace a malfunctioning device was 2.3% per 24 months, with only 0.6% per 24 months
risk of pump replacement because of pump thrombosis. Stroke
(namely, disabling stroke), major bleeding, and gastrointestinal haemorrhage were also lower in the centrifugal-flow pump group than in
the axial-flow pump group. However, the incidence of all bleeding

events, thromboembolism and driveline infection remained similar to
that with older devices. [402]

Data on fully magnetically centrifugal-flow LVAD use in real-world
studies with the 2-year outcomes from the ELEVATE registry
showed an overall survival of 74.5%, with gastrointestinal bleeding in
9.7%, stroke in 10.2%, and pump thrombosis in 1.5% of patients. [406]

According to the IMACS Registry, a new composite endpoint including QOL and adverse events beyond survival was proposed to help
in guiding decision making. In this sense ‘living well at one year’
defined as freedom from death, stroke, bleeding requiring operation,
RV assist device, pump replacement, or device-related infection
within the first year, was 56.8% after isolated, centrifugal flowLVAD. [383]

Although now outdated, REMATCH was the only RCT
comparing an LVAD as DT with OMT in patients with advanced HF,
NYHA class IV and a contraindication to transplantation. REMATCH
showed lower all-cause mortality with LVAD therapy when compared with medical treatment (primary endpoint). However, there
were high mortality rates at 2 years in both arms. [378] Other studies
were not randomized (INTrEPID, ROADMAP) [396][,][407][,][408] or compared different devices (ADVANCE, ENDURANCE, MOMENTUM
3). [399][,][402][,][409] The two strategies of early LVAD implantation vs. medical treatment with LVAD implantation only after serious deterioration of the patient’s condition are currently being compared in a

prospective trial, Early-VAD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT02387112). Also, the Swedish evaluation of LVAD (SweVAD)
study is comparing the survival of patients with advanced HF ineligible
for heart transplantation prospectively randomized to LVAD as DT
vs. MT (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02592499). [410]

10.2.3 Heart transplantation
Heart transplantation remains the gold standard for the treatment of
advanced HF in the absence of contraindications. Post-transplant 1year survival is around 90% with a median survival of 12.5
years. [385][,][411][,][412] Transplantation significantly improves QOL and functional status, although, for unclear reasons, the percentage of patients
returning to work is lower than expected. [412] Apart from primary
graft dysfunction, the main challenges after heart transplantation
relate to either the efficacy or side effects of immunosuppression
(e.g. rejection, infection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, late graft dysfunction, malignancy, renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus).

Organ donor shortage remains the main limitation to heart transplantation. Thus, the donor heart criteria have now been extended
to allow an increased upper limit of the donor age, particularly in
Europe. Moreover, careful recipient selection is needed, based on


pre-transplant and post-transplant life expectancy (both are influenced by pre-operative status and comorbidities).
The main indications and contraindications for heart transplantation are listed in Table 17. [376][,][385]

Active infection is a relative contraindication to transplant but in
some cases of infected LVADs it may actually be an indication. Elderly
age is not an absolute contraindication. Although patients aged <65
years might be more appropriate candidates due to their overall life
expectancy, most programmes accept patients up to 70 years of age,
and biological age as well as chronological age must be taken into
account. Surgical complexity [previous sternotomies, mediastinal
radiation, adult congenital heart disease (ACHD)] should also be

considered.

The decision pathway to transplantation or LVAD is never
straightforward and is unique to each patient. Eligibility for each
option may change according to the particular conditions of each
patient, which may also change over time. Other factors, not related
to the patient, such as time on the heart transplant waiting list, the

centre’s surgical experience, and resources, can also influence decision making. [413]

10.2.4 Symptom control and end-of-life care
While the disease trajectory of each patient with HF is unique, there
is a generalizable pattern of gradual decline, punctuated by episodes
of acute deterioration leading either to sudden death or death due to
progressive HF. Communication about the disease trajectory and
anticipatory planning should start when a patient is diagnosed with
advanced HF. Indications for and key components of a palliative care
service are reported in Tables 18 and 19. [312][,][418]

A team-based approach to palliative and end-of-life care for
patients with HF has been proposed. [419] Specific models of palliative
care for patients with advanced HF have been also reported. They
reduce hospitalizations, without a clear effect on survival, and have
some effects on QOL and symptom burden. [420][,][421]

Symptom assessment should be performed on a regular basis. In
addition to clinical assessment, symptoms can be assessed using
the Numeric Rating Scale, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment
Scale (ESAS) or ESAS-HF, or the Integrated Palliative care Outcome

Scale.

Treatment for symptoms needs to be considered and might
include additional intervention on top of OMT:

 - [Breathlessness: repeat doses of opioids may be considered for]

the relief of dyspnoea; however, their effectiveness is not demonstrated. [422][,][423] While using opioids, all patients should be guided
about opioid side effects such as constipation and nausea, urinary
retention, and mental status changes. Benzodiazepines may be
considered as a second- or third-line treatment, when opioids
and non-pharmacological measures have failed to control breathlessness. Increasing the inspired oxygen concentration may provide relief of dyspnoea.

 - [Pain: non-pharmacologic management can be helpful. In addition,]

opioid, oxycodone, hydromorphone, and fentanyl are generally
viewed as safe options and can be provided orally, intravenously,
and transdermally, especially in the hospital or in patient palliative
care or hospice setting. [424]

 - [Anxiety and depression: adequate conventional treatment should]

be offered.

Proactive decisions and advanced planning with regard to palliative
and end-of-life care discussions should be documented, regularly
reviewed, and routinely communicated to all those involved in the
patient’s care. Healthcare providers should make sure that patients’
and carer preferences are followed, wherever possible. They should
also take into account that patients may choose not to, or may not
be in a position to, express preferences (e.g. due to symptoms of
depression or cognitive impairment).
### 11 Acute heart failure

11.1 Epidemiology, diagnosis and
prognosis
AHF refers to rapid or gradual onset of symptoms and/or signs of
HF, severe enough for the patient to seek urgent medical attention, leading to an unplanned hospital admission or an emergency
department visit. Patients with AHF require urgent evaluation
with subsequent initiation or intensification of treatment, including i.v. therapies or procedures. AHF is a leading cause of hospitalizations in subjects aged >65 years and is associated with high
mortality and rehospitalization rates. In-hospital mortality ranges
from 4% to 10%. [425][�][428] Post-discharge 1-year mortality can be
25�30% with up to more than 45% deaths or readmission
rates. [104][,][426][,][427][,][429][,][430]

AHF may be the first manifestation of HF (new onset) or, more
frequently, be due to an acute decompensation of chronic HF.
Compared to patients with acutely decompensated CHF, those
with new onset HF may have a higher in-hospital mortality [425] but
have lower post-discharge mortality and rehospitalization
rates. [425][,][428][,][431][,][432] Specific extrinsic factors may precipitate, but
not cause, AHF in patients with pre-existing cardiac dysfunction
[(Supplementary Table 16). Clinical severity and in-hospital trajec-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
tory are determined by the complex interplay between precipitants, the underlying cardiac substrate, and the patient’s

comorbidities.

While the disease trajectory of each patient with HF is unique, there
is a generalizable pattern of gradual decline, punctuated by episodes
of acute deterioration leading either to sudden death or death due to

tomography; HF= heart failure; MR-proANP= mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide; NT-proBNP= N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; TSH
= thyroid-stimulating hormone. [a] Initial laboratory exams include troponin, serum creatinine, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen or urea, TSH, liver function
tests as well as D-dimer and procalcitonin when pulmonary embolism or infection are suspected, arterial blood gas analysis in case of respiratory distress,
and lactate in case of hypoperfusion. [b] Specific evaluation includes coronary angiography, in case of suspected ACS, and CT in case of suspected pulmonary
embolism. [c] Rule-in values for the diagnosis of acute HF: >450 pg/mL if aged <55 years, >900 pg/mL if aged between 55 and 75 years and >1800 pg/mL if
aged >75 years. [433][,][434]


The diagnostic workup of AHF starts at the time of the first medical contact, and is continued throughout the initial patient pathway,
aiming to identify the clinical presentation and to diagnose and
manage any potentially reversible causes/precipitants/coexisting
life-threatening conditions in a timely manner (Figure 6). Diagnostic
tests are outlined at Table 20. In addition to clinical signs and symptoms, diagnostic workup includes ECG and echocardiography, if possible. Additional investigations, i.e. chest X-ray and lung ultrasound
may be used to confirm AHF diagnosis, especially when NP testing is
not available. Plasma NP levels (BNP or NT-proBNP or MRproANP) should be measured if the diagnosis is uncertain and a
point-of-care assay is available. Normal concentrations of NPs make
the diagnosis of AHF unlikely. Cut-offs for acute HF are: BNP <100
. [........................................]


pg/mL, NT-proBNP <300 pg/mL and MR-proANP <120 pg/
mL. [74][,][433][�][435] However, elevated NP values are associated with a

wide range of cardiac and non-cardiac conditions (Table 6). Low concentrations can be detected in some patients with advanced decompensated end-stage HF, obesity, flash pulmonary oedema or rightsided AHF. Higher levels can be found in the patients with concomitant AF and/or reduced renal function. [74]

Among other laboratory tests, troponin is useful for the detection
of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) although elevated levels are
detected in the vast majority of patients with AHF. [436][�][438] Blood urea
nitrogen or urea, serum creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, potassium,
chloride), and antigen carbohydrate 125 may help tailor treatment. [439][,][440] Detection of abnormal liver function identifies patients

should be assessed in those with newly diagnosed AHF. Arterial
blood gas analysis should be performed when a precise measurement
of O 2 and CO 2 partial pressure is needed (i.e. patients with respiratory distress). Lactate and pH levels should be measured in patients
with cardiogenic shock. D-dimer should be measured when acute
pulmonary embolism is suspected. Procalcitonin may be used for the
diagnosis of pneumonia and antibiotic therapy may have an indication
when plasma levels are >0.2 lg/L. However, no impact of a strategy
based on routine procalcitonin measurements on outcomes was
shown in a prospective, controlled, trial. [442] Pulse oximetry should be

11.2 Clinical presentations
Four major clinical presentations can be described with possible
overlaps between them (Table 21). [1][,][425][,][445] Clinical presentations are

usually occurs in patients with history of HF and previous cardiac
dysfunction across the spectrum of LVEF and may include RV dysfunction. Distinct from the acute pulmonary oedema phenotype, it
has a more gradual onset, and the main alteration is progressive
fluid retention responsible for systemic congestion. Sometimes,
congestion is associated with hypoperfusion. [426] The objectives of
treatment are identification of precipitants, decongestion, and in
rare instances, correction of hypoperfusion (Figure 7).

11.2.2 Acute pulmonary oedema
Acute pulmonary oedema is related to lung congestion. Clinical criteria for acute pulmonary oedema diagnosis include dyspnoea with
orthopnoea, respiratory failure (hypoxaemia-hypercapnia), tachypnoea, >25 breaths/min, and increased work of breathing. [448]

Three therapies should be commenced, if indicated. First, oxygen,

given as continuous positive airway pressure, non-invasive positivepressure-ventilation and/or high-flow nasal cannula, should be

started. Second, i.v. diuretics should be administered, and third, i.v.

vasodilators may be given if systolic BP (SBP) is high, to reduce LV
afterload (Figure 8). In a few cases of advanced HF, acute pulmonary
oedema may be associated with low cardiac output and, in this case,
inotropes, vasopressors, and/or MCS are indicated to restore organ
perfusion.

ultimately reduce systemic cardiac output, through ventricular
interdependence. [449]

Diuretics are often the first option of therapy for venous congestion. Noradrenaline and/or inotropes are indicated for low cardiac
output and haemodynamic instability. Inotropes reducing cardiac filling pressures may be preferred (i.e. levosimendan, phosphodiesterase type III inhibitors). Since inotropic agents may aggravate arterial
hypotension, they may be combined with norepinephrine if needed
(Figure 9). [449]

11.2.4 Cardiogenic shock
Cardiogenic shock is a syndrome due to primary cardiac dysfunction
resulting in an inadequate cardiac output, comprising a lifethreatening state of tissue hypoperfusion, which can result in multiorgan failure and death. [450][�][452] Cardiac insult causing severe impairment of cardiac performance may be acute, as a result of the acute
loss of myocardial tissue (acute MI, myocarditis) or may be progressive as seen in patients with chronic decompensated HF who may
experience a decline in disease stability as a result of the natural progression of advanced HF and/or specific precipitants. [426]

Diagnosis of cardiogenic shock mandates the presence of clinical signs of hypoperfusion, such as cold sweated extremities, oliguria, mental confusion, dizziness, narrow pulse pressure. In
addition, biochemical manifestations of hypoperfusion, elevated

serum creatinine, metabolic acidosis and elevated serum lactate

are present and reflect tissue hypoxia and alterations of cellular

metabolism leading to organ dysfunction. [437][,][453] Of note, hypoperfusion is not always accompanied by hypotension, as BP may
be preserved by compensatory vasoconstriction (with/without
pressor agents), albeit at the cost of impaired tissue perfusion and
oxygenation. [426][,][427][,][450][,][454]
. [................]


Management of cardiogenic shock should start as early as possible. Early identification and treatment of the underlying cause,
concomitant with haemodynamic stabilization and management of
organ dysfunction, are key components of its management (Figure
[10, Supplementary text 11.1; Supplementary Figure 2).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)

11.3 Management
11.3.1 General aspects
Management can be subdivided in three stages (pre-hospital, in-hospital, and pre-discharge), having different goals and requiring different
approaches (Figure 11).

Pre-hospital phase
In the pre-hospital setting, AHF patients should benefit from noninvasive monitoring, including pulse oximetry, BP, heart rate respiratory rate, and a continuous ECG, instituted within minutes of patient
contact and in the ambulance if possible. [305] Oxygen therapy may be
given based on clinical judgment unless oxygen saturation is <90% in
which case it should be administered. In patients with respiratory distress, respiratory rate >25 breaths/min, oxygen saturation <90%,
non-invasive ventilation should be initiated. [444][,][448] Although therapeutic tools may be available in the prehospital setting, whether more
effective pre-hospital care would alter the clinical outcome remains

. [...................................................]


to be proven in randomized clinical trials. [455] Furthermore, prehospital management should not delay the rapid transfer of AHF
patients to the most appropriate medical setting. [455][,][456]

In-hospital management
Diagnostic workup and appropriate pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment must be started promptly and in parallel
(Figure 12). AHF patients are triaged to the appropriate level of care
according to the degree of haemodynamic instability and severity of
the critical illness. Disposition decisions are important components
[of the initial phase of management (see Supplementary text 11.2 and](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
[Supplementary Tables 17�19).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
The type and intensity of in-hospital monitoring depends on clinical
[severity, settings of care and in-hospital course (see Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
[text 11.3). As AHF is a heterogeneous condition, management may](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
differ according to the main clinical presentation. Management starts
with the search for specific causes of AHF. [1][,][305][,][430] These include

ACS, a hypertensive emergency, rapid arrhythmias or severe brady
cardia/conduction disturbance, acute mechanical causes such as acute

valve regurgitation or acute pulmonary embolism, infection, including
myocarditis, and tamponade (CHAMPIT) (Figure 12). After exclusion
of these conditions, which need to be treated/corrected urgently,
management of AHF differs according to the clinical presentations
(Figures 7�10). . [....................]


Pre-discharge phase
Details on this phase are shown in section 11.3.11.

11.3.2 Oxygen therapy and/or ventilatory support
In AHF, oxygen should not be used routinely in non-hypoxaemic
patients, as it causes vasoconstriction and a reduction in cardiac output. [457] Oxygen therapy is recommended in patients with AHF and

3652 ESC Guidelines

SpO 2 <90% or PaO 2 <60 mmHg to correct hypoxaemia. In chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hyper-oxygenation may
increase ventilation�perfusion mismatch, suppress ventilation and
lead to hypercapnia. During oxygen therapy, acid-base balance and
SpO 2 should be monitored.
Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, either continuous positive airway pressure and pressure support, improves respiratory failure, increases oxygenation and pH, and decreases the partial
pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) and work of breathing. Although
a large randomized trial had neutral results, meta-analyses suggest it
may improve dyspnoea and reduce the need for intubation and
mortality, compared with traditional oxygen therapy. [1][,][458][,][459] Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be started as soon as
possible in patients with respiratory distress (respiratory rate >25
breaths/min, SpO 2 <90%) to improve gas exchange and reduce the
rate of endotracheal intubation. [448][,][459] The fraction of inspired oxygen
(FiO 2 ) should be increased up to 100%, if necessary, according to
oxygen saturation level. . [......................................................]


Blood pressure should be monitored regularly during non-invasive
positive pressure ventilation. The increase in intrathoracic pressure
with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation decreases venous
return and right and left ventricular preload. It may also decrease cardiac output and BP and should therefore be used with caution in
patients with reduced preload reserve and hypotension. The increase
in pulmonary vascular resistance and RV afterload may also be detrimental in RV dysfunction. [448]

Intubation is recommended for progressive respiratory failure
in spite of oxygen administration or non-invasive ventilation
[(Supplementary Table 20).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data) [448]

11.3.3 Diuretics

Intravenous diuretics are the cornerstone of AHF treatment. They

increase renal excretion of salt and water and are indicated for the

treatment of fluid overload and congestion in the vast majority of
AHF patients.

ESC Guidelines 3653









Figure 12 Initial management of acute heart failure. MCS= mechanical circulatory support. [a] Acute mechanical cause: myocardial rupture complicating
acute coronary syndrome (free wall rupture, ventricular septal defect, acute mitral regurgitation), chest trauma or cardiac intervention, acute native or
prosthetic valve incompetence secondary to endocarditis, aortic dissection or thrombosis. [b] See Figures 7�10 for specific treatments according to different
clinical presentations.


Loop diuretics are commonly used due to their rapid onset of
action and efficacy. Data defining their optimal dosing, timing, and
method of administration are limited. No difference in the primary
efficacy outcome of patients’ symptoms global assessment was
shown with a high-dose regimen, compared with a low-dose regimen, in the DOSE trial. However, there was a greater relief of dyspnoea, change in weight and net fluid loss (with no prognostic role for
increases in serum creatinine) in the higher-dose regimen. [460][�][462]

High diuretic doses may cause greater neurohormonal activation and
electrolyte abnormalities and are often associated with poorer outcomes, although a cause and effect relation cannot be proven by
these retrospective analyses. [463][�][466] Based on these observations, it
may be appropriate, when starting i.v. diuretic treatment, to use low
doses, to assess the diuretic response and increase the dose when

that is insufficient.

Diuretic treatment should be started with an initial i.v. dose of
furosemide, or equivalent dose of bumetanide or torasemide, . [...................................................]


�
corresponding to 1 2 times the daily oral dose taken by the patient
before admission. If the patient was not on oral diuretics, a starting
dose of 20�40 mg of furosemide, or a bolus of 10�20 mg i.v. torase
�
mide, can be used. [145][,][467] Furosemide can be given as 2 3 daily
boluses or as a continuous infusion. Daily single bolus administrations
are discouraged because of the possibility of post-dosing sodium
retention. [145][,][461] With continuous infusion, a loading dose may be
used to achieve steady state earlier. Diuretic response should be
evaluated shortly after start of diuretic therapy and may be assessed
by performing a spot urine sodium content measurement after 2 or
6 h and/or by measuring the hourly urine output. A satisfactory diuretic response can be defined as a urine sodium content
>50�70 mEq/L at 2 h and/or by a urine output >100�150 mL/h during the first 6 h. [145][,][468] If there is an insufficient diuretic response, the
loop diuretic i.v. dose can be doubled, with a further assessment of
diuretic response. [145] If the diuretic response remains inadequate, e.g.
<100 mL hourly diuresis despite doubling loop diuretic dose,

3654 ESC Guidelines








Figure 13 Diuretic therapy (furosemide) in acute heart failure. i.v.= intravenous. [a] The maximal daily dose for i.v. loop diuretics is generally considered
furosemide 400�600 mg though up to 1000 mg may be considered in patients with severely impaired kidney function. [b] Combination therapy is the addition to the loop diuretic of a diuretic with a different site of action, e.g. thiazides or metolazone or acetazolamide. Modified from [145] .


concomitant administration of other diuretics acting at different sites,
namely thiazides or metolazone or acetazolamide, may be considered. However, this combination requires careful monitoring of
serum electrolytes and renal function (Figure 13). [145][,][469][,][470] This strategy, based on early and frequent assessment of diuretic response,
allows starting treatment with relatively low doses of loop diuretics,
with frequent dose adjustments that may be less likely to cause dehydration and increase in serum creatinine. The loop diuretic dose
should be progressively decreased when a significant negative fluid
balance has been obtained. However, it should be pointed out that
this algorithm is entirely based on expert opinion, to date. [145][,][461]

Transition to oral treatment should be commenced when the

patient’s clinical condition is stable. It is recommended that, after
achievement of congestion relief, oral loop diuretics are continued at
the lowest dose possible to avoid congestion. [463][,][471] Care must also
be taken to avoid patients being discharged from hospital with persistent congestion, as this is a major predictor of increased deaths and
rehospitalizations. [462][,][472] Hence, care should be taken to achieve
adequate decongestion and establish an appropriate long-term diuretic dose before discharge. [427][,][473] . [...........................................................]


11.3.4 Vasodilators

[Intravenous vasodilators, namely nitrates or nitroprusside (Supple-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
[mentary Table 21), dilate venous and arterial vessels leading to a](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
reduction in venous return to the heart, less congestion, lower afterload, increased stroke volume and consequent relief of symptoms.
Nitrates act mainly on peripheral veins whereas nitroprusside is
more a balanced arterial and venous dilator. [474][,][475] Because of their

mechanisms of action, i.v. vasodilators may be more effective than
diuretics in those patients whose acute pulmonary oedema is caused
by increased afterload and fluid redistribution to the lungs in the
absence or with minimal fluid accumulation. [427][,][476][�][478] However,

two recent randomized trials comparing usual care with early inten
sive and sustained vasodilation failed to show a beneficial effect of i.v.
vasodilators vs. high-dose diuretics. [479][,][480] No recommendation
favouring a regimen based on vasodilator treatment vs. usual care can
thus be given, to date.
Intravenous vasodilators may be considered to relieve AHF symptoms when SBP is >110 mmHg. They may be started at low doses
and uptitrated to achieve clinical improvement and BP control.
Nitrates are generally administered with an initial bolus followed by

ESC Guidelines 3655


arrhythmic events and with a greater mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock but not in those with hypovolaemic or septic shock.
Although the trial included 1679 patients, significance was seen only
in a subgroup analysis of the 280 patients with cardiogenic shock and
<10% of the patients had MI. As there were no data regarding revascularization, this limits the generalizability of the results. [485] In another
prospective randomized trial epinephrine was compared with norepinephrine in patients with cardiogenic shock due to acute MI. [486] The
trial was stopped prematurely due to a higher incidence of refractory
shock with epinephrine. Epinephrine was also associated with higher
heart rate and lactic acidosis. Despite limitations related to its relatively small sample size, short time of follow-up and lack of data
regarding the maximum reached dose, the study suggests superior
efficacy and safety with norepinephrine. These data are consistent
with a meta-analysis including 2583 patients with cardiogenic shock
showing a three-fold increase in the risk of death with epinephrine,
compared with norepinephrine, in patients with cardiogenic
shock. [487] However, the lack of information about dose, duration of

treatment, and aetiology, makes these results partially explorative.

11.3.7 Opiates
Opiates relieve dyspnoea and anxiety. They may be used as sedative
agents during non-invasive positive pressure ventilation to improve
patient adaptation. Dose-dependent side effects include nausea,
hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression. Retrospective

acute heart failure

continuous infusion. However, they may also be given as repeated

�
boluses. Nitroglycerine can be given as 1 2 mg boluses in severely
hypertensive patients with acute pulmonary oedema. [477] Care should
be taken to avoid hypotension due to an excessive decrease in
preload and afterload. For this reason, they should be used with
extreme caution in patients with LVH and/or severe aortic stenosis.
However, favorable effects were described in patients with LV systolic dysfunction and aortic stenosis when vasodilators were given
with careful monitoring of haemodynamic parameters. [481]

11.3.5 Inotropes
Inotropes are still needed for treatment of patients with low cardiac
output and hypotension (Table 22). They should be reserved for
patients with LV systolic dysfunction, low cardiac output and low SBP
(e.g. <90 mmHg) resulting in poor vital organ perfusion. However,
they must be used with caution starting at low doses and uptitrating
them with close monitoring. [387][,][388]

Inotropes, especially those with adrenergic mechanisms, can cause
sinus tachycardia, increase ventricular rate in patients with AF,
may induce myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmias, and increase mortality. [387][,][388][,][430][,][478] Levosimendan or type-3-phosphodiesterase
inhibitors may be preferred over dobutamine for patients on
beta-blockers as they act through independent mechanisms. [482][,][483]

Excessive peripheral vasodilation and hypotension can be major limitations of type-3-phosphodiestaerase inhibitors or levosimendan,
especially when administered at high doses and/or when commenced
with a bolus dose. [482][,][484]

11.3.6 Vasopressors
Vasopressors used for the treatment of AHF are reported in Table 22.
Among drugs with a prominent peripheral arterial vasoconstrictor
action, norepinephrine may be preferred in patients with severe
hypotension. The aim is to increase perfusion to the vital organs.
However, this is at the expense of an increase in LV afterload.
Therefore, a combination of norepinephrine and inotropic agents
may be considered, especially in patients with advanced HF and cardiogenic shock.
Some studies, though with limitations, support the use of norepinephrine as first choice, compared with dopamine or epinephrine.
Dopamine was compared with norepinephrine as a first-line vasopressor therapy in patients with shock and was associated with more

analyses suggest that morphine administration is associated with a
greater frequency of mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospitalization,
more intensive care unit admissions, and increased mortality. [488][�][491]

Thus, routine use of opiates in AHF is not recommended although
they may be considered in selected patients, particularly in case of
severe/intractable pain or anxiety or in the setting of palliation.

11.3.8 Digoxin
Digoxin should be considered in patients with AF with a rapid ventricular rate (>110 b.p.m.) despite beta-blockers (see also section
12.1.1). [151][,][492][,][493] It can be given in boluses of 0.25�0.5 mg i.v., if not
used previously. However, in patients with comorbidities (i.e. CKD)
or other factors affecting digoxin metabolism (including other drugs)
and/or the elderly, the maintenance dose may be difficult to estimate
theoretically and measurements of serum digoxin concentrations
should be performed. Digitoxin is a potential alternative to digoxin
and is currently being evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled
trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03783429). [158]

11.3.9 Thromboembolism prophylaxis
Thromboembolism prophylaxis with heparin (e.g. low-molecularweight heparin) or another anticoagulant is recommended, unless
contraindicated or unnecessary (because of existing treatment with
oral anticoagulants). [494][,][495]

11.3.10 Short-term mechanical circulatory support
In patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, short-term MCS may
be necessary to augment cardiac output and support end-organ perfusion. Short-term MCS can be used as a BTR, BTD or BTB. [450][-][452]

The initial improvements in cardiac output, BP and arterial lactate
may be counterbalanced by significant complications. High-quality
evidence regarding outcomes remains scarce. Hence, the unselected
use of MCS in patients with cardiogenic shock is not supported and
they require specialist multidisciplinary expertise for implantation
and management, similar to that outlined for advanced HF centres
[(Supplementary text 11.4; Supplementary Table 22, see also section](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
10.2.2). [376][,][496] Recent studies show that a ‘standardized team-based
approach’ using predefined algorithms for early MCS implant coupled
with close monitoring (invasive haemodynamics, lactate, markers of
end-organ damage) may potentially translate into improved
survival. [497][�][499]

The Intra-aortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II (IABPSHOCK-II) trial showed no difference in 30-day, as well as in longterm, mortality between intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and OMT
in patients with cardiogenic shock following acute MI who underwent
early revascularization. [500][�][502] According to these results, IABP is not
routinely recommended in cardiogenic shock post-MI. However, it
may still be considered in cardiogenic shock, especially if not due to
ACS, and refractory to drug therapy, as a BTD, BTR, or BTB.
Other short-term MCS were compared with IABP in small,
randomized trials and propensity-matched analyses with inconclusive
results. [503][�][507] Similarly, RCTs comparing extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO) with IABP or MT are lacking. A meta-analysis
including only observational studies showed favourable outcomes in
patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest treated with venoarterial (VA)-ECMO compared to controls. [508] VA-ECMO may also
be considered in fulminant myocarditis and other conditions causing
severe cardiogenic shock. [509] Depending on the severity of myocardial dysfunction and/or concomitant mitral or aortic regurgitation,
VA-ECMO may increase LV afterload with an increase in LV end

diastolic pressure and pulmonary congestion. In these cases, LV
unloading is mandatory and can be achieved by means of transeptal/
ventricular apex vent or adding an unloading device such as the
Impella device. [510][,][511]

11.3.11 Pre-discharge assessment and post-discharge
management planning
A significant proportion of patients with AHF are discharged with
minimal or no weight loss and, more importantly, persistent congestion. [427][,][472] Persistent congestion before discharge is associated with
a higher risk of readmission and mortality. [426][,][472] Treatment, including
diuretic dose, should therefore be optimized in order to keep the
patient free of congestion.

In those admitted with ADHF, oral OMT should be continued,

except for possible dose reduction or withdrawal if there is haemodynamic instability (symptomatic hypotension), severely impaired
renal function or hyperkalaemia. Once haemodynamic stabilization is
achieved with i.v. therapy, treatment should be optimized before discharge. [467] Treatment optimization has three major aims. First, to
relieve congestion. Second, to treat comorbidities, such as iron deficiency, that have an impact on post-discharge outcome. [512] Third, to

initiate, or restart oral, OMT with beneficial effects on outcome.

Doses may be uptitrated before discharge and/or in the early postdischarge phase.
Studies have shown that such optimization of medical treatment is
associated with a lower risk of 30-day readmission, although prospective randomized trials have not been performed, to date. [103][,][467][,][513]

Retrospective analyses show that discontinuation or dose reduction
of beta-blocker therapy during an AHF hospitalization is associated
with worse outcomes. [514] Initiation of ARNI in recently hospitalized
stable patients with HFrEF, including those who are ACE-I/ARB
naı¨ve, is safe and may be considered in this setting. [106][,][107] Safety and
better outcome have also been recently shown in a prospective
randomized trial with sotagliflozin in diabetic patients hospitalized for
HF, irrespective of their LVEF. [136]

It is recommended to have one follow-up visit within 1 to 2 weeks
after discharge. [515][,][516] Components of this follow-up visit should
include monitoring of signs and symptoms of HF, assessment of volume status, BP, heart rate, and laboratory measurements including
renal function, electrolytes, and possibly NPs. Iron status and hepatic
function should also be assessed when not done before discharge.
Based on clinical evaluation and laboratory exams, further optimization and/or initiation of disease-modifying treatment for HFrEF
should occur. Retrospective studies show that such an approach is
associated with lower 30-day readmission rates although prospective
randomized trials have not been performed, to date. [513][,][516][�][518]

impairment. [519][�][523] The proportion of patients with HF who develop
AF increases with age and HF severity. When AF causes HF the clinical course seems more favourable than with other causes of HF (so
called tachycardiomyopathy). [524] In contrast, development of AF in
patients with chronic HF is associated with worse prognosis, including stroke and increased mortality. [525][,][526]

The management of patients with concomitant HF and AF is summarized in Figure 14. [7][,][521] It includes:

(1) Identification and treatment of possible causes or triggers of AF

(2) Management of HF

(3) Prevention of embolic events

(4) Rate control

(5) Rhythm control

Identification of triggers and management of heart failure
Potential causes or precipitating factors such as hyperthyroidism,
electrolyte disorders, uncontrolled hypertension, mitral valve dis
ease, and infection should be identified and corrected.

Worsening congestion due to AF should be managed with diuretics. Congestion relief may reduce sympathetic drive and ventricular rate and increase the chance of spontaneous return to SR. The
presence of AF may reduce or abolish the prognostic benefits of
beta-blockers and renders ivabradine ineffective. [12][,][125] Some treat
ments for HF decrease the risk of developing AF, including ACE-I,
slightly, and CRT, probably. [7][,][527]

Prevention of embolic events

Unless contraindicated, an oral, long-term anticoagulant is recommended in all patients with HF and paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred

for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with AF and
without severe mitral stenosis and/or mechanical valve prosthesis, as
they have similar efficacy to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) but a lower
risk of intracranial haemorrhage. [528]

LA appendage closure can be considered in patients with HF and
AF who have a contraindication to oral anticoagulation though data
from randomized trials have not included patients with contraindications to oral anticoagulants. [529][,][530]

Rate control

Data regarding rate control are not conclusive for the patients with
AF and HF. A strategy of lenient rate control, defined by a resting
heart rate <110 b.p.m., was compared to a strategy of strict rate control, defined by a heart rate <80 b.p.m. at rest and <110 b.p.m. during
moderate exercise, in RACE II and in a pooled analysis of RACE and
AFFIRM. [152][,][531] The studies showed no differences in outcome

between the two strategies. However, only 10% of the patients in
RACE II and 17% of those in the pooled analysis had a history of HF

�
hospitalization or NYHA class II III, respectively. [152][,][531] Higher heart

rates are associated with worse outcomes in observational studies. [532][,][533] Thus, a lenient rate control is an acceptable initial approach
with, however, treatment targeting a lower heart rate in case of persistent symptoms or cardiac dysfunction likely related to tachycardia
(e.g. tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy). [7][,][534]

Beta-blockers can be used for rate control in patients with HFrEF
or HFmrEF because of their established safety in these patients (see
section 5.3.2). [7][,][534][,][535] Digoxin or digitoxin can be considered when
the ventricular rate remains high, despite beta-blockers, or when
beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. [151][,][493][,][536] It may

therefore be considered also an alternative to beta-blockers. For

patients with NYHA class IV and/or haemodynamic instability, i.v.
amiodarone can be considered to reduce ventricular rate. [537] For

HFpEF, there is a paucity of evidence to demonstrate efficacy of any
agent. The RATE-AF trial compared digoxin with bisoprolol in

�
patients with persistent AF and NYHA class II IV symptoms.
Compared with bisoprolol, digoxin had the same effect on QOL at 6
months (primary endpoint) and a better effect on EHRA and NYHA
functional class. [536] Only 19% of the patients had LVEF <50% so that
most of the patients can be considered as having HFmrEF or
HFpEF. [536]

AV node ablation can be considered in patients with poor ventricular rate control despite medical treatment not eligible for rhythm
control by catheter ablation or in patients with biventricular
pacing. [7][,][538][�][540]

Rhythm control
Urgent electrical cardioversion is recommended in the setting of
acute worsening HF in patients presenting with rapid ventricular rates
and haemodynamic instability, after consideration of the thromboembolic risk. Cardioversion should be considered also to improve symptoms in patients who have persistent and symptomatic AF, despite
optimal pharmacological management. In patients who do not
receive chronic therapy with oral anticoagulant and with AF onset
>48 h, at least 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a transoesophageal echocardiography is needed before cardioversion. [7] When
pharmacological cardioversion is preferred, amiodarone is the drug

dronedarone) are associated with worse outcomes in
HFrEF. [186][,][534][,][541][�][544] Amiodarone can help maintain HF patients in
SR after cardioversion. [545][,][546]

Trials including patients with HF and comparing rate control and
rhythm control strategies with the latter based on antiarrhythmic
drugs failed to show any benefit of one strategy over the other. [547][�][550] More recently, EAST-AFNET 4, enrolling patients with
early AF, 28.6% with HF, was stopped early after a median follow-up
of 5.1 years for a lower occurrence of the primary outcome of death,
stroke, or hospitalization for worsening HF or ACS in the patients
assigned to early rhythm control vs. those assigned to usual care. [551]

However, the patients assigned to the rhythm control strategy had a
closer follow-up, which may have influenced their better outcome.
Catheter ablation was performed in a minority of the patients in the
rhythm control arm (19.4%). [551]

LA catheter ablation was compared with MT, rate or rhythm control strategy, in 363 patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF, LVEF
<35% and an implanted device (ICD or CRT-D) enrolled in the
CASTLE-AF trial. [552] The primary endpoint of all-cause death or HF
hospitalizations occurred in fewer patients in the ablation group vs.
the MT group, 51 patients (28.5%) vs. 82 (44.6%) [hazard ratio (HR);
95% confidence interval (CI), 0.62; 0.43�0.87; P =0.007]. Also, other
endpoints, all-cause or CV death or worsening HF, were reduced by
catheter ablation. [552] This trial suggests that catheter ablation can
improve the prognosis of patients with HFrEF. However, it enrolled a
highly selected population, 363 of 3013 patients, was not blinded, had
crossovers between the two treatment strategies and the number of
events observed was low: 24 (13.4%) vs. 46 (25.0%) all-cause deaths
and 37 (20.7%) vs. 66 (35.9%) HF hospitalizations in the ablation and
MT groups, respectively. [552]

The CABANA trial was an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicentre, randomized trial enrolling 2204 patients with symptomatic
AF. The trial failed to show a benefit of AF ablation strategy over
medical care on the primary composite endpoint of death, disabling
stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest in the overall population. [553]

In an analysis of the 778 patients (35%) with NYHA class symptoms
>II, the primary outcome occurred in 34 patients (9.0%) in the catheter ablation group vs. 49 (12.3%) in the drug therapy group (HR; 95%

�
CI, 0.64; 0.41 0.99). [554] However, also in this trial, the number of
events was small and HF was defined based only on symptoms with
LVEF available in 73% of the patients and >50% and 40�49% in 79%
and 11.7% of the cases, respectively. [554] Both CASTLE-AF and
CABANA showed a highly significant effect of catheter ablation on
patients’ symptoms. [552][�][554]

Two other prospective trials enrolled patients with HFrEF and
persistent AF, who were randomized to catheter ablation or MT in
one trial (AMICA trial, n = 140), and to catheter ablation or amiodarone in the other one (AATAC trial, n = 203). [555][,][556] The first trial
failed to show any difference in the LVEF increase between the two
groups. [555] The second trial showed superiority of catheter ablation
with respect of AF recurrence, the primary endpoint, with also a
reduction in unplanned hospitalizations and mortality. [556] In contrast
with the AMICA trial, [555] but in accordance with CASTLE-AF, [552]

AATAC also showed a benefit of catheter ablation on LVEF. [556]

In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence in favour of a strategy
of rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs vs. rate control in
patients with HF and AF. [547][�][551] The results of randomized trials with


LA appendage closure can be considered in patients with HF and
AF who have a contraindication to oral anticoagulation though data
from randomized trials have not included patients with contraindications to oral anticoagulants. [529][,][530]


Rate control

Data regarding rate control are not conclusive for the patients with
AF and HF. A strategy of lenient rate control, defined by a resting
heart rate <110 b.p.m., was compared to a strategy of strict rate control, defined by a heart rate <80 b.p.m. at rest and <110 b.p.m. during
moderate exercise, in RACE II and in a pooled analysis of RACE and
AFFIRM. [152][,][531] The studies showed no differences in outcome

between the two strategies. However, only 10% of the patients in
RACE II and 17% of those in the pooled analysis had a history of HF

�
hospitalization or NYHA class II III, respectively. [152][,][531] Higher heart

rates are associated with worse outcomes in observational studies. [532][,][533] Thus, a lenient rate control is an acceptable initial approach
with, however, treatment targeting a lower heart rate in case of persistent symptoms or cardiac dysfunction likely related to tachycardia
(e.g. tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy). [7][,][534]

Beta-blockers can be used for rate control in patients with HFrEF
or HFmrEF because of their established safety in these patients (see
section 5.3.2). [7][,][534][,][535] Digoxin or digitoxin can be considered when
the ventricular rate remains high, despite beta-blockers, or when
beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. [151][,][493][,][536] It may

therefore be considered also an alternative to beta-blockers. For

patients with NYHA class IV and/or haemodynamic instability, i.v.
amiodarone can be considered to reduce ventricular rate. [537] For

HFpEF, there is a paucity of evidence to demonstrate efficacy of any
agent. The RATE-AF trial compared digoxin with bisoprolol in

�
patients with persistent AF and NYHA class II IV symptoms.

functional class. [536] Only 19% of the patients had LVEF <50% so that
most of the patients can be considered as having HFmrEF or

Rhythm control

acute worsening HF in patients presenting with rapid ventricular rates
and haemodynamic instability, after consideration of the thromboembolic risk. Cardioversion should be considered also to improve symptoms in patients who have persistent and symptomatic AF, despite
optimal pharmacological management. In patients who do not
receive chronic therapy with oral anticoagulant and with AF onset
>48 h, at least 3 weeks of therapeutic anticoagulation or a transoesophageal echocardiography is needed before cardioversion. [7] When

of choice as other antiarrhythmic drugs (i.e. propafenone, flecainide,

lead to reversible systolic dysfunction. Possible factors may include
dyssynchrony and abnormal calcium handling. [560]

Initial management of ventricular arrhythmias in HF should include
correction of potential precipitants (including electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypo/hyperkalaemia, and pro-arrhythmic drugs) as
well as the optimization of HF drug therapy. Although ischaemia may
be a triggering factor, revascularization has not been shown to reduce
risk of ventricular arrhythmias. [561]

Amiodarone is effective also for suppression of ventricular
arrhythmias. However, it does not reduce the incidence of sudden
cardiac death or overall mortality. [161] For patients with premature
ventricular contraction (PVC)-induced CMP, amiodarone administration may be considered to reduce recurrent arrhythmias and
improve symptoms and LV function, although its side effects should
be taken into consideration. Other drugs are discussed in
[Supplementary text 12.1.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
Radiofrequency ablation of VPBs may improve LV function and,
possibly, outcomes in patients with tachycardiomyopathy when VPBs
contribute to LV dysfunction. [562] A sustained reduction in the baseline

PVC burden has been associated with a lower risk of cardiac mortal
ity, cardiac transplantation, or hospitalization for HF during followup. [563][,][564]

12.1.3 Symptomatic bradycardia, pauses and atrio
ventricular block

Indications for pacemaker therapy do not differ in patients with HF
from those with other CV disease. There is ample evidence that RV
pacing may have an adverse effect on LV systolic function leading, in
the long term, to HF. [565] Patients with HFrEF requiring frequent ventricular pacing, e.g. with AV block or slow AF, and who have systolic
dysfunction, should be implanted with CRT rather than a standard
pacemaker to avoid adverse outcomes, as shown in the BLOCK-HF
(Biventricular versus Right Ventricular Pacing in Heart Failure
Patients with Atrioventricular Block) trial. [216] In the quest for a more
physiological alternative to RV pacing, physiological pacing is being
increasingly adopted. [566] In a non-randomized comparison of 304 consecutive patients with His bundle pacing and 433 consecutive patients
with RV pacing, the former group had less HF hospitalization and a
trend in reduced mortality. [567] Although the technique is promising,

more data are needed to confirm its role.

12.2 Chronic coronary syndromes

CAD is the most common cause of HF in industrialized, middle
income, and increasingly in low-income, countries. It should be considered as possible cause of HF in all patients presenting with new

onset HF.

The diagnostic workup of patients with HF and chronic coronary
syndromes (CCS) is reported in the recent 2019 ESC Guidelines on
CCS. [5] Patients with HF should be carefully evaluated to assess signs
and/or symptoms of CCS. Clinical and family histories, physical
examination, ECG and imaging tests are recommended. [5]

Documentation of ischaemia using non-invasive and invasive tests can
be difficult in patients with HF because of the possible exercise
intolerance and the effects of increased end-diastolic LV pressures.
Coronary angiography or CTCA can be performed to establish the

presence and extent of CAD and evaluate the potential indication for
revascularization (see section 4.3). [5]

12.2.1 Medical therapy
Beta-blockers are the mainstay of therapy in patients with HFrEF and
CAD because of their prognostic benefit. [116][�][120][,][568] Ivabradine should
be considered as an alternative to beta-blockers (when contraindicated) or as additional anti-anginal therapy in patients in SR whose
heart rate is >_70 b.p.m. [139][,][569] Other anti-anginal drugs (e.g. amlodipine,
felodipine, nicorandil, ranolazine, and oral or transdermal nitrates) are
effective for treating symptoms, although data about their effects on
outcomes are neutral or lacking. [5][,][570][�][574] Trimetazidine seems to have
additive effects, such as improvement of LV function and exercise
capacity, in patients with HFrEF and CCS already on beta-blockers. [575][�][577] Trimetazidine and other anti-anginal drugs may be considered in patients with HF and angina despite beta-blocker and/or
ivabradine. Short-acting nitrates should be used with caution in patients
with HF as they cause hypotension. Diltiazem and verapamil increase
HF-related events in patients with HFrEF and are contraindicated. [578]

An algorithm for the use of anti-anginal medications in patients
with HFrEF is reported in Figure 15. . [..............................................................]


Beta-blockers, long-acting nitrates, calcium channel blockers
(CCBs), ivabradine, ranolazine, trimetazidine, nicorandil and
their combinations should be considered in HFpEF for angina
relief but without a foreseen benefit on HF and coronary end

points.
Low-dose of rivaroxaban [2.5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.)] did not add
prognostic benefit in patients with HFrEF and CCS in the
COMMANDER-HF trial, a study to assess the effectiveness and
safety of rivaroxaban in reducing the risk of death, MI or stroke in
participants with HF and CAD following an episode of decompensated HF. [579] This trial included patients with HFrEF and a recent
episode of worsening HF occurring within 21 days from the time
of enrolment. These patients are at high risk of HF-related events
and these were the main cause of deaths and hospitalizations in

the trial. Rivaroxaban had no effect on these events. In contrast, in

a non-pre-specified subgroup analysis of the COMPASS trial, low
dose of rivaroxaban, on top of aspirin, was associated with a reduction in ischaemic events in patients with HF, mainly HFmrEF or
HFpEF. [580] Based on these data, low-dose rivaroxaban may be considered in patients with CAD (or peripheral artery disease) and

haemorrhagic risk.

12.2.2 Myocardial revascularization
Data on the benefit of myocardial revascularization in patients with

HF are limited.

STICH compared coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with
MT in patients with CAD, amenable by CABG, and with reduced LV
function (EF <_35%). At a median follow-up of 56 months, there was
no significant difference between the CABG group and the MT group
in the rate of death from any cause, primary outcome of the trial. [89]

The extended follow-up report showed a significant reduction of
death in the CABG group vs. the control group (58.9% vs. 66.1%; HR
0.84; 95% CI, 0.73�0.97; P = 0.02) over 10 years. [581] CV death and
the combined endpoint of all-cause death or hospitalization for
CV causes were also significantly reduced after CABG at 10 years
of follow-up. [581] Post hoc analyses of the STICH trial suggested
that neither myocardial viability, angina, nor ischaemia were related
with outcomes after revascularization. [92][,][93][,][582] The Heart Failure

Revascularisation Trial (HEART) was under-powered, with only 138
of the planned 800 patients to be enrolled, and failed to show differences in outcomes between HF patients receiving CABG or MT. [583]

There are currently no reported RCTs comparing percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) with MT in patients with HFrEF.

However, the REVIVED-BCIS2 trial has finished recruitment
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01920048). [584] There are also no
randomized studies comparing PCI with CABG as such randomized
trials excluded patients with HFrEF. In one prospective registry,
including 4616 patients with multivessel disease and HFrEF,
propensity-score matched comparisons showed similar survival
(mean follow-up 2.9 years) in PCI vs. CABG group with PCIs associated with a higher risk of MI, particularly in patients with incomplete
revascularization, and CABG associated with a higher risk of
stroke. [585] A propensity-matched analysis showed a significantly
lower risk of death or major CV events in diabetic patients with LV
dysfunction and multivessel disease treated with CABG compared
with PCI. [586] CABG was associated with better outcome than PCI

also in patients with moderate or severe LV dysfunction and left main
or complex coronary disease. [587][,][588] Two meta-analyses confirmed
that CABG is associated with better outcomes, including mortality,
MI, and repeated revascularization, compared with PCI
and/or MT. [589][,][590]

Aortic stenosis may cause or worsen HF by increasing LV afterload
and causing LV hypertrophy and remodelling. [591] When HF symptoms occur in patients with severe aortic stenosis, prognosis is
extremely poor. No MT for aortic stenosis can improve outcomes.
HF medical treatment should be given to all HF patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Care must be taken using vasodilators
to avoid hypotension. Importantly, possible improvement of symptoms after MT should not delay intervention.
In the presence of suspected symptomatic and severe highgradient aortic stenosis (valve area <_1 cm [2], mean gradient >_40
mmHg), other causes of high flow status must be excluded and

intervention is recommended in patients with HF symptoms and
severe, high-gradient aortic stenosis, regardless of LVEF.
Management of patients with low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis is
reported in Figure 16. [592]

Intervention is recommended in patients with a life expectancy >1
year, avoiding futility. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
has been shown to be non-inferior to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in reducing clinical events (including mortality and disabling stroke) in patients at high and intermediate risk for
surgery. [593][�][600] In low-risk patients, mean age in the RCTs comparing
TAVI and SAVR was >70 years and follow-up was restricted to
2 years. Therefore, SAVR is recommended in patients aged <75 years
and at low surgical risk (STS-PROM score or EuroSCORE II <4%),
whereas TAVI is recommended in those aged >75 years or at high/
prohibitive surgical risk (STS-PROM score or EuroSCORE II >8%). In

all the other cases, the choice between TAVI and SAVR should be

made by the Heart Team, weighing the pros and cons of each procedure, according to age, life expectancy, individual patient preference
and other features including clinical and anatomical aspects. Aortic

12.3.2 Aortic regurgitation
Severe aortic regurgitation can lead to progressive LV dilation with
subsequent dysfunction, HF, and poor prognosis.
MT can improve HF symptoms in patients with severe aortic
regurgitation. In particular, inhibitors of the RAAS can be useful. [601]

Beta-blockers should be cautiously used as they prolong diastole and

may worsen aortic regurgitation.
Aortic valve surgery is recommended in patients with severe aortic
regurgitation and HF symptoms regardless of LVEF. [592][,][602][,][603] In case . [..........................]


of high or prohibitive surgical risk, TAVI has been used to treat also
aortic regurgitation. [604]

12.3.3 Mitral regurgitation
Primary (organic) mitral regurgitation
Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is caused by abnormalities of the
valve apparatus and can cause HF.
Surgery, preferably repair, is recommended in patients with
severe primary MR and HF symptoms. If surgery is contraindicated

or considered at high risk, then percutaneous repair may be

Secondary (functional) mitral regurgitation
Secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) is mostly a disease of the left
ventricle. It can also be caused by mitral annulus enlargement due
to LA dilation. [606] Moderate or severe SMR is associated with an
extremely poor prognosis in patients with HF. [607][,][608] The assessment of MR aetiology and severity should be performed by an
experienced echocardiographer applying a multi-parametric
approach, and ideally in stable patient conditions, after optimization
of medical and resynchronization therapies. Being SMR a dynamic

Secondary (functional) mitral regurgitation
Secondary mitral regurgitation (SMR) is mostly a disease of the left
ventricle. It can also be caused by mitral annulus enlargement due
to LA dilation. [606] Moderate or severe SMR is associated with an
extremely poor prognosis in patients with HF. [607][,][608] The assessment of MR aetiology and severity should be performed by an
experienced echocardiographer applying a multi-parametric
approach, and ideally in stable patient conditions, after optimization
of medical and resynchronization therapies. Being SMR a dynamic
condition, echocardiographic quantification during exercise may be
helpful in patients with moderate SMR at rest and symptoms during
physical activity. [609] Early referral of patients with HF and moderate
or severe MR to a multidisciplinary Heart Team, including HF specialists, is recommended for assessment and treatment planning.
The Heart Team has to verify, first of all, that the patient is on
optimal therapy, including CRT, when indicated (Figure 17).
In patients with severe SMR and HFrEF requiring revascularization,
mitral valve surgery and CABG should be considered. Isolated mitral
valve surgery may be considered in symptomatic patients with severe
SMR despite optimal therapy and low surgical risk. [592]

Two randomized trials, MITRA-FR and COAPT, evaluated the

effectiveness of percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair plus
OMT compared to OMT alone, in symptomatic patients with
reduced LVEF (15�40% in MITRA-FR and 20�50% in COAPT) and
moderate-to-severe or severe SMR [effective regurgitant orifice area
(EROA) >_ 20 mm [2] in MITRA-FR and EROA >_ 30 mm [2] in
COAPT]. [610][�][612] MITRA-FR failed to show any benefit from the
intervention on all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization at 12

�
months (primary endpoint; HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.73 1.84) and at 24
months. [610][,][611] In contrast, COAPT showed a significant reduction in
hospitalization for HF at 24 months (primary endpoint; HR 0.53, 95%
CI 0.40�0.70) and mortality (secondary endpoint; HR 0.62, 95% CI
0.46�0.82). [612] Differences in patient selection, concomitant MT,
echocardiographic assessment, procedural issues and severity of
SMR in relation to the degree of LV dilatation may be responsible for
the diverging results of the MITRA-FR and COAPT trials. [613][�][615]

Thus, percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair should be considered for outcome improvement only in carefully selected patients

�
who remain symptomatic (NYHA class II IV) despite OMT, with
moderate-to-severe or severe SMR (EROA >_30 mm [2] ), favourable
anatomical conditions, and fulfilling the inclusion criteria of the

�
COAPT study (i.e. LVEF 20 50%, LV end-systolic diameter <70
mm, systolic pulmonary pressure <70 mmHg, absence of moderate
or severe RV dysfunction, absence of severe TR, absence of haemodynamic instability) (Figure 17). [615][,][616]

Percutaneous edge-to-to edge mitral valve repair may also be
considered to improve symptoms in patients with advanced HF,
severe SMR and severe symptoms despite OMT. In these patients,
cardiac transplantation or LVAD implantation must also be
considered. [376][,][617]

Other percutaneous mitral valve repair systems, such as indirect
annuloplasty, are available for treatment of SMR. This approach has a
shorter learning curve and lesser technical requirements than percutaneous edge-to-to edge mitral valve repair and does not preclude

different procedures once it is performed. A sham-controlled
randomized trial testing a transcatheter indirect mitral annuloplasty
device met its primary endpoint of mitral regurgitant volume reduction with reverse LV and LA remodelling at 12 months. [618] Further

studies confirmed favourable results on LA volumes and LV remodel
ling with trends towards improvement in mean 6MWT distance and
symptoms and a reduction in HF hospitalizations in an IPD meta-analysis. [619][�][622] Transcatheter mitral valve replacement is also emerging
as a possible alternative option, but randomized trials are still
lacking. [623]

Mitral valve interventions are not recommended in patients with a
life expectancy of <1 year due to extra-cardiac conditions. [592]

3666 ESC Guidelines


12.3.4 Tricuspid regurgitation
Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) can be caused by or be a consequence
of RV dysfunction and HF. The management of HF with TR includes
MT (i.e. diuretics, neurohormonal antagonists). Transcatheter therapy and surgery may be considered in selected cases. [592] A multidisciplinary Heart Team, including HF specialists, should be considered
for assessment and treatment planning.
Tricuspid valve surgery is recommended in patients with severe
TR requiring left-sided cardiac surgery. It should be also considered
in patients with moderate TR and tricuspid annulus dilatation requiring left-sided cardiac surgery and in symptomatic patients with isolated severe TR. [592] However, surgery in isolated TR is burdened by
high in-hospital mortality (8.8%) although the advanced stage of HF
may have influenced these data. [624] Transcatheter techniques have
recently emerged as potential treatment options of TR. Preliminary
results show improvement in TR severity and symptoms with low
complication rates. [625] Further prospective studies are needed to
show the prognostic impact of these treatments in HF patients.

12.4 Hypertension
Arterial hypertension is a leading risk factor for the development of
HF. Almost two-thirds of HF patients have a past history of hypertension. [104][,][626] Clinical trials evaluating antihypertensive strategies and BP
targets in patients with HF and hypertension have not been
performed.
Treatment of HFrEF is similar in hypertensive and normotensive
patients. Recommended medications, including neurohormonal
antagonists and diuretics, lower also BP. Lifestyle modifications, such
as weight loss, reduced sodium intake, and increased physical activity,
are useful adjunctive measures. [4] Uncontrolled hypertension in
patients with HFrEF is rare, provided the patient is receiving OMT at
recommended doses for HF. If further BP lowering is required, in
absence of signs of fluid overload, amlodipine and felodipine have
been shown to be safe in HFrEF and may be considered. [570][,][571] Nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem and verapamil) and centrally acting
agents, such as moxonidine, are contraindicated as they are associated with worse outcomes. [627] Alpha-blockers have no effects on survival and are therefore not indicated. [143] They can be used for the
treatment of concomitant prostatic hyperplasia but should be withdrawn in cases of hypotension.
Hypertension is the most important cause of HFpEF, with a prevalence of 60% to 89%. [39] Patients with HFpEF also frequently have an
exaggerated hypertensive response to exercise and may present
with hypertensive acute pulmonary oedema. [628][,][629] Antihypertensive
agents, including ACE-I, ARBs, beta-blockers, CCB, and diuretics
reduce the incidence of HF. [630][,][631] Reducing BP leads also to LVH
regression, the degree of which depends on the class of drug used. [4]

ARBs, ACE-I, and CCBs cause more effective LVH regression than
beta-blockers or diuretics. [632] Poorly controlled hypertension may
precipitate episodes of decompensation. Causes of secondary hypertension, such as renal vascular or parenchymal disease, primary aldosteronism and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), should be ruled out
or, if confirmed, considered for treatment. Treatment of hypertension is an important issue in patients with HFpEF, but the optimal
treatment strategy is uncertain. The treatment strategy used in
HFrEF should also be considered in HFpEF. [4] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


BP targets are uncertain in both HFrEF and HFpEF. However, evaluation of patient’s age and comorbidities (i.e. diabetes, CKD, CAD,
valvular heart disease and stroke) can be helpful to personalize the
BP target. [4] Every effort should be made to reach target doses of
evidence-based medications in HFrEF patients, despite slight hypotension. [4][,][633] Conversely, in HFpEF patients with LVH and limited preload reserve, hypotension should be avoided.

12.5 Stroke

HF and stroke frequently coexist because of an overlap of shared risk
factors and subsequent mechanisms. [519][,][634] A higher risk of stroke is
present also in HF patients in SR. [39][,][426][,][635][�][637] AF confers an additional risk and patients with HF and AF have a five-fold increased risk
compared to the control population. [519][,][634][,][638]

As a temporal trend, the incidence of stroke is higher in the first
30 days after HF diagnosis or an episode of HF decompensation and
decreases in the first 6 months following the acute event. [637][,][639]

Patients with stroke and HF have higher mortality, more severe neurological deficits and longer hospital stays than those without
HF. [637][,][640] Similarly, patients with HF and stroke have a higher mortality than patients without stroke. [640] In COMMANDER-HF, 47.5% of
strokes were either disabling, 16.5%, or fatal, 31%. [637]

Patients with HF and concomitant AF, including paroxysmal AF,
have a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of at least 1 and have therefore an indi
cation to anticoagulation. The indication to antithrombotic strategies
in patients with HF and SR is controversial. In the Warfarin and
Aspirin in Reduced Cardiac Ejection Fraction (WARCEF) trial, warfarin reduced ischaemic stroke as compared with aspirin, but
increased major haemorrhages and did not influence the primary
endpoint of ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, or
death. [641] Meta-analyses confirm an increased risk of bleeding outweighing ischaemic stroke prevention in placebo-controlled trials in
patients with HFrEF and SR. [642] In COMMANDER-HF, rivaroxaban
2.5 mg b.i.d. did not improve the composite outcome of all-cause
mortality, MI or stroke, nor did it favourably influence HF-related
deaths or HF hospitalizations. [579] There are no data to support a routine strategy of anticoagulation in patients with HFrEF in SR who do
not have history of paroxysmal AF. However, low-dose rivaroxaban
may be considered in patients with concomitant CCS or peripheral
artery disease, a high risk of stroke and no major haemorrhagic risk
(see section 12.2).
Patients with visible intraventricular thrombus or at high thrombotic risk, such as those with history of peripheral embolism or some
patients with PPCM or LV non-compaction (LVNC), should be considered for anticoagulation. [3][,][643][�][645]
### 13 Non-cardiovascular comorbidities

13.1 Diabetes
Treatment of HF is similar in patients with and without diabetes. [6][,][646]

Conversely, antidiabetic drugs differ in their effects in patients with
HF and preference must be given to drugs that are both safe and
reduce HF-related events. [6][,][646][,][647]

ESC Guidelines 3667


The SGLT2 inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin,
ertugliflozin and sotagliflozin were studied in patients with established

CV disease in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME and VERTIS-CV trials,

with established CV disease or CV risk factors in the CANVAS and

DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials, and with CKD and CV risk in the SCORED
trial, respectively. [293][�][297] A small proportion of patients had a history
of HF. Empagliflozin and canagliflozin reduced the primary composite
endpoint of major CV adverse events, including CV death or nonfatal MI or non-fatal stroke, and HF hospitalizations in EMPA-REG
OUTCOME and CANVAS, respectively. [293][,][294] Empagliflozin also
reduced all-cause death or CV death alone. [293] The effects on the primary endpoint were driven by the reduction in HF-related
events. [293][,][294] In DECLARE-TIMI 58, dapagliflozin did not reduce
major CV events but reduced the co-primary efficacy endpoint of CV
death or HF hospitalization and HF hospitalization alone. [295] In
VERTIS-CV, neither the primary major CV event endpoint nor the
key secondary outcome of CV death or HF hospitalization were
reduced significantly by ertugliflozin, although there was a statistically
significant reduction in HF hospitalization and repeated hospitalizations. [297][,][648] In SCORED, sotagliflozin reduced CV deaths and HF
hospitalizations. [296] In a meta-analysis of these trials and one further
trial in patients with CKD (CREDENCE), overall SGLT2 inhibitors
reduced HF and CV hospitalization by 22%. [649] SGLT2 inhibitors
were well tolerated, although they may cause genital fungal skin infections and, rarely, diabetic ketoacidosis. [293][�][295] Trial results with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF, with or without
diabetes, and with the SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin in patients with
type 2 diabetes stabilized after hospitalization for acute HF or within
3 days after discharge, further support the administration of these
agents (see section 5.3.5 and section 11.3.11). [108][,][109][,][136]
. [............................................................................................]


EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, and

VERTIS-CV also showed a reduction in worsening renal function,
end-stage renal disease or death from renal causes, with SGLT2

inhibitors.

Based on these results, the SGLT inhibitors canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, ertugliflozin or sotagliflozin are recommended
to prevent HF and CV death and worsening kidney function in
patients with type 2 diabetes and CV disease and/or CV risk factors,
or CKD. Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are also indicated for the
treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and HFrEF (see
section 5.3.5 and section 11.2.4) and sotagliflozin was shown to
reduce CV deaths and HF rehospitalizations in patients recently hospitalized for HF. [6][,][296][,][646][,][647][,][650]

Metformin is thought to be safe in patients with HF, compared
with insulin and sulfonylureas, based on observational studies. [651][,][652]

However, it is not recommended in patients with an eGFR <30 mL/
min/1.73 m [2] or hepatic impairment because of the risk of lactic acidosis. It has not been studied in controlled outcome trials, to date. [6][,][646]

Regarding dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, HF hospitalizations were increased by 27% in one trial with saxagliptin in patients
with diabetes. [653] However, no difference over placebo for HF events
was found with alogliptin, sitagliptin, and linagliptin. [654][�][656] Vidagliptin
was associated with an increase in LV volumes and a numerically
greater number of deaths and CV events in a small trial in patients
with diabetes and HF. [657] Overall, the effects on mortality or CV

events were neutral in the DPP-4 inhibitor trials and meta

analyses. [658][,][659] These drugs are therefore not recommended to
reduce CV events in diabetic patients with HF.
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce the risk
of MI, stroke, and CV death in patients with diabetes, although probably do not reduce incident HF. [6][,][660] Liraglutide had no effect on

LVEF, increased heart rate, and increased serious cardiac events in a

randomized placebo-controlled trial in 241 patients with HFrEF with
and without diabetes. [661] Neutral results on the primary endpoint
were found in another trial in 300 patients with a numerical increase
in deaths and HF hospitalizations, compared with placebo. [662] GLP-1
receptor agonists are therefore not recommended for the preven
tion of HF events.

Insulin is needed in patients with type 1 diabetes and to control
hyperglycaemia in some patients with type 2 diabetes, especially
when beta-cell function is exhausted. It is a sodium-retaining hormone and concern has been raised that it may exacerbate fluid retention in patients with HF. However, in a RCT that included patients
with type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting
glucose, insulin did not increase the risk of incident HF. [663] Use of
insulin was associated with poorer outcomes in retrospective analyses of randomized trials and administrative databases. [664][,][665] If insulin

is needed in a patient with HF, the patient should be monitored for
evidence of worsening of HF after treatment initiation.
Sulfonylureas were associated with a higher risk of HF events in
some analyses. [666][,][667] Therefore, they are not a preferred treatment
in patients with HF and, if needed, patients should be monitored for
evidence of worsening of HF after treatment initiation. [6][,][646]

Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) cause sodium and water retention
and an increased risk of worsening HF and hospitalization. [668] They

were associated with poorer outcomes in observational studies in
patients with HF. [670][,][671] Treatment of thyroid disorders should be
guided by general endocrine guidelines. There are no randomized trials
evaluating the efficacy of thyroid replacement therapy in subclinical
hypothyroidism, but there is a general agreement to correct it when
the TSH is >10 mIU/L, particularly in patients <70 years. Correction

may also be considered at lower TSH levels (7 10 mIU/L). [672][�][674]

13.3 Obesity
Obesity is a risk factor for hypertension and CAD and is also associated with an increased risk of HF. There is possibly a stronger association with HFpEF. [258][,][675][�][677] Once obese patients have HF, an obesity
paradox has been described such that overweight or mildly/moderately obese patients have a better prognosis than leaner patients, particularly compared with those who are underweight. [678][,][679] However,
other variables may influence this relationship and the obesity paradox is not observed in patients with diabetes. [680][,][681] Second, BMI
does not take into account body composition, e.g. the relation
between lean skeletal muscle mass and fat mass. Obese patients who
are fit and have a preserved skeletal muscle mass have better prognosis than obese sarcopenic patients. [682] Waist circumference or the
waist-to-hip ratio, measuring visceral obesity, is less influenced by
muscle mass and may have a stronger relationship with outcomes
than BMI, especially in female patients. [683][,][684]

Body fat has a major impact on the diagnostic and prognostic value
of multiple parameters. Obese patients with HF have lower NP concentrations due to increased expression of clearance receptors and
augmented peptide degradation by the adipose tissue. [74] Peak oxygen
consumption adjusted for body weight underestimates exercise
capacity in obese patients and an adjustment for lean body mass
should be used for risk stratification. [96]

Obesity may be a major cause of HFpEF and obese HFpEF patients
display several pathophysiologic mechanisms that differ from nonobese patients with HFpEF. [258][,][675][�][677][,][685] Caloric restriction and
exercise training had additive beneficial effects on exercise capacity
and QOL of patients with obesity and HFpEF in a randomized trial. [337]

13.4 Frailty, cachexia, sarcopenia
Frailty is a multidimensional dynamic state, independent of age, that
makes the individual more vulnerable to the effect of stressors. [686] HF

and frailty are two distinct yet commonly associated conditions. The
assessment of frailty in patients with HF is crucial as it is associated

with both unfavourable outcomes and reduced access to, and toler
ance of, treatments. Several tools have been proposed for frailty
screening and assessment in different chronic conditions, including HF.
The HFA of ESC has developed a HF-specific tool based on four major
domains, clinical, psycho-cognitive, functional, and social. [686]

Frailty is more prevalent in patients with HF than in the general population and may occur in up to 45% of the patients, according to a
recent meta-analysis. [687][,][688] Patients with HF are up to six times more
likely to be frail, and frail people have a significantly increased risk of
developing HF. [689][,][690] Frailty is associated with a higher risk of death,
hospitalizations, and functional decline as well as with a longer duration of hospital stay. [691][�][693] The treatment of frailty in HF should be
multifactorial and targeted to its main components and may include
physical rehabilitation with exercise training, nutritional supplementa
[686] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Cachexia is defined as a ‘complex metabolic syndrome associated
with underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or
without loss of fat mass’. [694] Its major clinical feature is a >5%
oedema-free body weight loss during the previous 12 months or
less. [694][,][695] Cachexia is a generalized wasting process that may coexist

�
with frailty and may occur in 5 15% of patients with HF, especially

those with HFrEF and more advanced disease status. It is associated
with reduced functional capacity and decreased survival. [695][�][698] As it

is associated with other chronic diseases, such as cancer, alternative,
non-cardiac causes for cachexia should always be investigated. [699]

Sarcopenia is defined by the presence of low muscle mass together
with low muscle function, strength, or performance. [698] It is usually
identified by an appendicular skeletal muscle mass, defined as the sum

of the muscle mass of the four limbs, 2 standard deviation below the

�
mean of a healthy reference group aged 18 40years with a cut-off
value of 7.26 kg/m [2] for men. [688][,][700][,][701] It occurs physiologically with
aging. However, it is accelerated by chronic diseases, such as cancer

�
and HF. Sarcopenia can be found in 20 50% of patients with HFrEF
and is often associated with frailty and increased morbidity and mortality. It is a major determinant of outcomes outweighing the effect of
body weight and BMI. [684][,][698][,][701][,][702] So far, the most effective strategy
for sarcopenia treatment is resistance exercise training, possibly com
�
bined with a protein intake of 1 1.5 g/kg/day. [698][,][703] Drug treatments,
including anabolic compounds like testosterone, growth hormone,
ghrelin receptor agonists, were tested in small studies, showing favourable results mostly in terms of exercise capacity and muscle
strength. [697][,][703][�][705] There are no data showing a favourable impact of
sarcopenia treatment on outcomes. However, exercise training has
favourable effects in patients with HF (see section 9.4). [95][,][323][�][329]

13.5 Iron deficiency and anaemia
Iron deficiency and anaemia are common in patients with HF, being
independently associated with reduced exercise capacity, recurrent
HF hospitalizations, and high CV and all-cause mortality. [706][,][707]

According to the World Health Organization criteria, anaemia is
defined as a haemoglobin concentration <12 g/dL in women and
<13 g/dL in men. In patients with HF, iron deficiency is defined as

�
either a serum ferritin concentration <100 ng/mL or 100 299 ng/
mL with transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20%. [708][�][710] Ferritin tissue
expression and concentration in the peripheral blood is increased by

inflammation and several disorders such as infection, cancer, liver dis
ease, and HF itself. Hence, higher cut-off values have been applied for
the definition of iron deficiency in patients with HF. [709][�][711] Another
marker reflecting depleted intracellular iron can be high serum soluble transferrin receptors, which derives from proteolysis of the membrane transferrin receptor. Its synthesis is increased in case of iron
deficiency and is not affected by inflammation. High serum soluble
transferrin receptors identify patients at high risk of death beyond
standard prognostic variables. [711][,][712] However, its applicability for
iron supplementation therapy has not been demonstrated yet.
Iron deficiency, which can be present independently of anaemia, is
present in up to 55% of chronic HF patients and in up to 80% of those
with AHF. [713][�][716] It may be caused by increased loss, reduced intake
or absorption (i.e. malnutrition, gut congestion) and/or impaired iron
metabolism caused by the chronic inflammatory activation of HF,
although the exact cause of iron deficiency in HF remains unknown.
Iron deficiency may impair functional capacity, precipitate circulatory


13.3 Obesity
Obesity is a risk factor for hypertension and CAD and is also associated with an increased risk of HF. There is possibly a stronger association with HFpEF. [258][,][675][�][677] Once obese patients have HF, an obesity
paradox has been described such that overweight or mildly/moderately obese patients have a better prognosis than leaner patients, particularly compared with those who are underweight. [678][,][679] However,
other variables may influence this relationship and the obesity paradox is not observed in patients with diabetes. [680][,][681] Second, BMI
does not take into account body composition, e.g. the relation
between lean skeletal muscle mass and fat mass. Obese patients who
are fit and have a preserved skeletal muscle mass have better prognosis than obese sarcopenic patients. [682] Waist circumference or the
waist-to-hip ratio, measuring visceral obesity, is less influenced by
muscle mass and may have a stronger relationship with outcomes
than BMI, especially in female patients. [683][,][684]

Body fat has a major impact on the diagnostic and prognostic value
of multiple parameters. Obese patients with HF have lower NP concentrations due to increased expression of clearance receptors and
augmented peptide degradation by the adipose tissue. [74] Peak oxygen
consumption adjusted for body weight underestimates exercise
capacity in obese patients and an adjustment for lean body mass
should be used for risk stratification. [96]

Obesity may be a major cause of HFpEF and obese HFpEF patients
display several pathophysiologic mechanisms that differ from nonobese patients with HFpEF. [258][,][675][�][677][,][685] Caloric restriction and
exercise training had additive beneficial effects on exercise capacity
and QOL of patients with obesity and HFpEF in a randomized trial. [337]


13.4 Frailty, cachexia, sarcopenia
Frailty is a multidimensional dynamic state, independent of age, that
makes the individual more vulnerable to the effect of stressors. [686] HF

and frailty are two distinct yet commonly associated conditions. The
assessment of frailty in patients with HF is crucial as it is associated

with both unfavourable outcomes and reduced access to, and toler
ance of, treatments. Several tools have been proposed for frailty

hospitalizations, and functional decline as well as with a longer duration of hospital stay. [691][�][693] The treatment of frailty in HF should be
multifactorial and targeted to its main components and may include
physical rehabilitation with exercise training, nutritional supplementation as well as an individualized approach to treating comorbidities. [686]

decompensation, promote skeletal muscle dysfunction, and is associated with frailty, irrespective of anaemia. [716][�][718]

It is recommended that all patients with HF are regularly screened
for anaemia and iron deficiency with full blood count, serum ferritin

concentration, and TSAT. The detection of anaemia and/or iron defi
ciency should prompt appropriate investigation to define their cause.
Darbepoetin-alpha failed to reduce all-cause death or HF hospitalization and increased the risk of thromboembolic events in the only
large-scale randomized trial in patients with HFrEF and mild to moderate anaemia. [719] As a result, erythropoietin stimulating agents are

not indicated for the treatment of anaemia in HF.

RCTs have shown that iron supplementation with i.v. ferric carboxymaltose is safe and improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and
QOL of patients with HFrEF and iron deficiency. [720][�][723] Metaanalyses of RCTs showed also a reduction in the risk of the combined
endpoints of all-cause death or CV hospitalization, CV death or HF
hospitalization, CV death or recurrent CV or HF hospitalizations. [724][,][725] The favourable effects of iron supplementation were
independent from anaemia coexistence. [726] In AFFIRM-AHF, patients
hospitalized for HF with LVEF <50% and concomitant iron deficiency
were randomized to i.v. ferric carboxymaltose or placebo, repeated
at 6- and then 12-week intervals if indicated according to repeat iron
studies. [512] Administration of ferric carboxymaltose did not significantly reduce the primary composite outcome of total HF hospitalizations and CV death at 52 weeks (rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI
0.62�1.01, P = 0.059). However, it reduced the composite endpoint . [.........................................................................................................................................................................]


�
of first HF hospitalization or CV death (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 0.98,
P = 0.030) and total HF hospitalizations (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CI
0.58�0.94, P = 0.013). [512] Therefore, iron supplementation with i.v.
ferric carboxymaltose should be considered for the improvement of
symptoms, exercise capacity, and QOL in patients with HF and LVEF
<45%. It should also be considered for the reduction of HF rehospitalizations in patients with LVEF <50% recently hospitalized for worsening HF. Ongoing trials are expected to provide more evidence on
the effects of ferric carboxymaltose in patients with HFpEF. In addition, large outcomes trials with other iron formulations are ongoing
in HFrEF, HFpEF, and AHF. [727] Oral iron therapy is not effective in
iron repletion and did not improve exercise capacity in patients with
HFrEF and iron deficiency. [728] It is therefore not recommended for
the treatment of iron deficiency in the patients with HF.

13.6 Kidney dysfunction
CKD and HF frequently coexist. [471][,][707][,][729] They share common risk
factors, such as diabetes or hypertension. CKD may worsen CV function causing hypertension and vascular calcification. HF may worsen
renal function, through the effects of neurohormonal and inflammatory activation, increased venous pressure and hypoperfusion.
Oxidative stress and fibrosis likely play a major role as pathogenic
mechanisms in HF with CKD. [730][,][731]

While CKD and worsening renal function both appear more
common in HFpEF as compared to in HFmrEF and HFrEF, perhaps
due to shared pathophysiological mechanisms, they appear to be less
associated with worse outcomes in HFpEF than in HFmrEF and
HFrEF. [732][,][733]

CKD is a major independent determinant of increased mortality and
morbidity in HF. [471][,][734][�][736] However, there are settings in which
changes in serum creatinine are not associated with worse outcomes.

When RAAS inhibitors, ARNI or SGLT2 inhibitors are started, the ini
tial decrease in the glomerular filtration pressure may decrease GFR
and increase serum creatinine. However, these changes are generally
transient and occur despite improvement in patient outcomes and
slower worsening of renal function in the long term. For instance, in
EMPEROR-Reduced, the placebo-corrected eGFR dip induced by
empagliflozin at week 4 was of 2.4 mL/min/1.73 m [2] for patients with
CKD and 2.7 mL/min/1.73 m [2] for those without CKD, corresponding
to a decrease from baseline of 5.2% and 3.8%, respectively. This was
followed by a slower slope of eGFR decline and by a reduced rate of
the composite kidney outcome with empagliflozin vs. placebo, with no
difference between patients with or without CKD at baseline. [109][,][737]

Thus, with respect to the initiation of RAAS inhibitors, ARNI or

SGLT2 inhibitors, a transient decrease in renal function should not

prompt their interruption. An increase in serum creatinine of <50%
above baseline, as long as it is <266 lmol/L (3 mg/dL), or a decrease in
eGFR of <10% from baseline, as long as eGFR is >25 mL/min/1.73 m [2],
[can be considered as acceptable (see section 5.3 and Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
[Table 8). Also, with respect to diuretic therapy, small and transient](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
rises in serum creatinine during treatment of acute HF are not associated with poorer outcomes when the patient is free of
congestion. [108][,][109][,][460][�][462][,][471][,][729][,][737][�][740]

RCTs have shown that iron supplementation with i.v. ferric carboxymaltose is safe and improves symptoms, exercise capacity, and

are similar, if not greater, than in the patients with normal renal function. [206][,][471][,][741][,][742] Beta-blockers reduce mortality in HFrEF patients
with moderate (eGFR 45�59 mL/min/1.73 m [2] ) and moderately
severe (eGFR 30�44 mL/min/1.73 m [2] ) renal dysfunction, whereas
limited evidence is available regarding patients with severe renal
impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m [2] ). [743] Sacubitril/valsartan,
compared with enalapril, led to a slower decline in renal function,
despite a slight increase in the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, and
improved CV outcomes to a similar extent in patients with CKD vs.
the others in PARADIGM-HF. [127] SGLT2 inhibitors lead to a slower

decline in renal function, compared with placebo, both in patients
with HFrEF and in those with CKD. [108][,][109][,][737][,][738][,][744] The improvement in cardiac output after CRT or LVAD implantation may be
associated with, at least, a transient improvement in renal function. [471][,][745][,][746] The benefits of ICDs may be reduced in patients with
severe renal dysfunction because of the competing risk of nonarrhythmic causes of death. [747][�][749]

There is little direct evidence to support any recommendations
for treatment of HF patients with severe CKD as to date, RCTs
excluded patients with advanced stages of CKD, i.e. eGFR <30 mL/
min/1.73 m [2] [(Supplementary Table 23). Cut-off values for inclusion](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
were lower in recent trials: 25 mL/min/1.73 m [2] in DAPA-CKD,
20 mL/min/1.73 m [2] in EMPEROR-Reduced and GALACTIC-HF, and
15 mL/min/1.73 m [2] in VICTORIA, respectively. [109][,][141][,][737][,][738][,][750]

Despite differences in baseline characteristics between patients with
severely impaired renal function and the others, no interaction
between drug effects and renal function was noted in subgroup analysis of these trials. [109][,][141][,][738][,][750]

13.7 Electrolyte disorders:
hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia,
hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia
Electrolyte disturbances are frequent in patients with HF and may
often be iatrogenic. [751] Serum potassium levels have a U-shaped relation with mortality with the lowest risk of death within a relatively
narrow range of 4 to 5 mmol/L. [752][�][758]

Hypokalaemia is defined as serum potassium <3.5 mmol/L and
may occur in up to 50% of patients with HF. [759] Hypokalaemia is often
induced by loop and thiazide diuretic administration. It may cause
lethal ventricular arrhythmias and increase CV mortality. Its treatment includes the use of RAAS inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, and prescription of oral potassium supplements (i.e. potassium
chloride tablets). When oral administration is not possible, potassium
supplementation by infusion may be necessary (20 to 40 mmol of

�
potassium in 250 1000 mL of normal saline). Potassium-rich solution should be infused at slow rate through a large vein using a venous

catheter.

Hyperkalaemia is defined as serum potassium >5 mmol/L and can
be classified as mild (>5.0 to <5.5 mmol/L), moderate (5.5 to 6.0
mmol/L), or severe (>6.0 mmol/L). [760] It is associated with an
increased risk of hospitalization and death. [752][,][753][,][755][,][756][,][761][,][762]

Hyperkalaemia can be associated with the administration of RAAS
inhibitors, CKD and increased absorption. [760] Among patients with

. [......................................................................................................................................................................]


with HF appears to be less than 5%, [757] but the incidence is much
higher, at up to 40% in chronic HF and 73% in CKD over follow-up
durations of approximately 1 year. [753][,][756][,][757][,][763][�][765] In PARADIGM
HF, treatment with sacubitril/valsartan was associated with lower risk
of severe hyperkalaemia, compared with enalapril. [128] Life-threatening
hyperkalaemia requires immediate treatment with a combination of

calcium carbonate and/or sodium bicarbonate, insulin, with or with
out glucose, and beta adrenoceptor agonists [e.g. salbutamol, offlabel use in some European Union (EU) countries]. These agents
favour potassium entry into the cells and do not increase potassium
excretion. Thus, they only provide temporary benefit and rebound
hyperkalaemia can occur after few hours. Loop diuretics can be
administered to facilitate potassium loss.
Potassium binders bind to potassium in the gastrointestinal tract
reducing its absorption. They can be used for acute and chronic
potassium lowering. They include sodium polystyrene sulfonate, calcium polystyrene sulfonate, and the much better tolerated patiromer
sorbitex calcium and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC). Sodium
polystyrene sulfonate is still indicated in anuric or severely oliguric
patients, but it should not be used in the medium or long term as it
may cause severe gastrointestinal side effects, including bowel
necrosis. [760] Patiromer or SZC increase faecal potassium excretion
and act mainly in the colon. Both compounds are effective in normalizing elevated potassium levels, maintaining normokalaemia over time
and preventing the recurrence of hyperkalaemia and can be considered for treatment of hyperkalaemia [766][�][768] [(see Supplementary Table](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
[24).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
Renal dysfunction and hyperkalaemia are the major causes of
underuse of RAAS inhibitors, particularly MRA, in clinical
practice. [342][,][753][,][758][,][769][�][771] Administration of the potassium-lowering
agents, patiromer or SZC, may allow their initiation or uptitration in
a larger proportion of patients. This hypothesis was tested in doubleblind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials with patiromer or placebo administration to patients with CKD and hyperkalaemia, or discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors for hyperkalaemia, and with an
indication for spironolactone for HF and/or resistant hypertension.
Patiromer was more likely to lower serum potassium and decreased
episodes of hyperkalaemia than spironolactone initiation and
uptitration. [772][�][775] The ongoing RCT DIAMOND (NCT03888066)
is testing the impact on clinical outcomes of a strategy based on
patiromer administration, compared with placebo, in patients with
HFrEF who are hyperkalaemic while on RAAS inhibitors or with a
history of hyperkalaemia with subsequent reduction or discontinuation of a RAAS inhibitor [776][,][777] [(see Supplementary text 13.1).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
Hyponatraemia is defined as a serum sodium concentration lower
than 136 mmol/L. It is common in HF and may be present in up to
30% of patients admitted to hospital with HF. It reflects neurohormonal activation and is a powerful independent marker of poor outcomes in patients with acute or chronic HF. [778][,][779]

Severe hyponatraemia may cause neurologic symptoms (seizures,
obtundation, delirium) due to cerebral oedema and may require
immediate treatment with hypertonic saline with serum sodium

severe, e.g. >124 mmol/L, and in the absence of symptoms. As the
pathogenesis of hyponatraemia in HF is dilutional, e.g. caused by
water retention induced by increased vasopressin secretion, treatment is based on water restriction or vasopressin antagonists. Fluid
restrictions to less than 800�1000 mL/day may be indicated to
achieve a negative water balance and treat hyponatraemia. Water
restriction was associated with improved QOL in a small, randomized study but with only slight increases in serum sodium in an observational registry. [780][,][781] Tolvaptan, an orally active selective arginine
vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, can be considered to increase
serum sodium and diuresis in patients with persistent hyponatraemia
and congestion. However, no effects on outcomes have been shown
in RCTs [782][�][785] [(see Supplementary text 13.1). The infusion of hyper-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab368#supplementary-data)
tonic saline combined with loop diuretics was associated with an
increase in serum sodium levels and greater diuretic efficacy in small
trials and observational studies. [786][�][788]

Hypochloraemia (<96 mmol/L) is a powerful independent predictor of mortality in patients with acute and chronic HF. [439][,][789][�][792]

Serum chloride may have a direct role in the control of renin secretion and the response to loop or thiazide diuretics. [439][,][793] The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide increases chloride
reabsorption causing a greater bicarbonate and sodium excretion in
the proximal tubule of the nephron. It can increase serum chloride
levels and diuresis in patients with severe HF at risk of diuretic resistance. [145][,][794] It is currently being tested in a multicentre randomized
study in decompensated HF. [469]

13.8 Lung disease, sleep-disordered
breathing
Overall, COPD affects about 20% of patients with HF and has a major
impact on symptoms and outcomes. [795][�][797] Due to the overlap in
symptoms and signs, the differentiation between HF and COPD may
be difficult. Pulmonary function testing with spirometry is recommended as the first diagnostic tool and should be considered in
patients with suspected COPD. For adequate interpretation, it
should be performed in stable and euvolaemic patients to avoid congestion related to obstructive pulmonary function patterns. If there is
uncertainty about the reversibility of airflow obstruction, pneumology referral for more sophisticated tests (bronchodilatatory test,
bronchial provocation tests, diffusion capacity) is warranted. [798][,][799]

Treatment of HF is generally well tolerated in COPD. [800] Betablockers can worsen pulmonary function in individual patients but

are not contraindicated in either COPD or asthma, as stated in the

Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and
the Global INitiative for Asthma (GINA), respectively. [801][,][802] GINA
states that asthma should not be regarded as an absolute contraindication to the use of cardioselective beta-blockers (bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate, or nebivolol) with consideration of relative risks and
benefits. In clinical practice, starting with low doses of cardioselective
beta-blockers combined with close monitoring for signs of airway
obstruction (wheezing, shortness of breath with lengthening of the
expiration) should be encouraged. Although not tested in HF

seem to increase CV events, including HF, in patients at high
risk. [803][,][804] Moreover, optimal COPD management can improve cardiac function. [805]

Sleep-disordered breathing occurs in more than one third of
patients with HF and is even more prevalent in patients with AHF.
The most common types are: central sleep apnoea (CSA, similar to
Cheyne-Stokes respiration), OSA, and a mixed pattern of the two.
CSA and OSA have been shown to be associated with a worse prog
nosis in HF. OSA is associated with an increased risk of incident HF in

men. CSA is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing
in HFrEF and HFmrEF is the most common cause of CSA. [806][,][807]

Patients with HF can be investigated for sleep-disordered breathing. History taking should involve partners. Questionnaires are instrumental in identifying patients at risk. Home monitoring can usually
identify and distinguish the type of sleep apnoea. However, overnight
polysomnography remains the definitive investigation. [807] The use of
adaptive servo-ventilation in patients with HFrEF and predominantly

CSA is not recommended, based on the results of SERVE-HF, which

was neutral regarding the composite primary endpoint of death from
any cause or lifesaving CV intervention, but showed an increase in
both all-cause mortality and CV mortality with adaptive servo-ventilation. [808] Transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation was tested in a prospective, multicentre, randomized trial involving 151 patients with
CSA. [809] The primary efficacy endpoint was the reduction of the
apnoea-hypopnoea index from baseline to 6 months and was
achieved by a larger percentage of patients with the active treatment.
Other measurements of sleep quality and QOL were improved and
no difference in any safety endpoint was found between active treatment and control. [809] Similar results were observed in the 96 patients
with HF. [810]

Patients with HFrEF being considered for a sleep-disordered
breathing treatment with positive pressure airway mask must
undergo formal sleep study to document the predominant type of
sleep apnoea (central vs. obstructive). When sleep-disordered
breathing is caused by OSA, nocturnal hypoxaemia can be treated
with nocturnal oxygen supplementation, continuous positive airway
pressure, bi-level positive airway pressure, and adaptive servo
ventilation. However, none of these interventions has been shown to
have beneficial effects on outcomes in HF. [807] When sleepdisordered breathing is caused by CSA, positive pressure airway
masks are contraindicated in HFrEF patients. [808] In these patients,
implantable phrenic nerve stimulation can be considered for sympto
matic relief.

13.9 Hyperlipidaemia and lipid-modifying
therapy
Two large RCTs, including mainly patients with HFrEF, as well as a
meta-analysis of 24 RCTs, showed no benefit of statin treatment on
CV mortality or stroke in patients with HFrEF. [811][,][812] A reduction in
HF hospitalizations as well as a small reduction in MI was observed in
a meta-analysis of the CORONA and GISSI-HF trials. [813][�][815] Based
on current evidence, routine administration of statins in patients with
HF without other indications for their use (e.g. CAD) is not


Hypochloraemia (<96 mmol/L) is a powerful independent predictor of mortality in patients with acute and chronic HF. [439][,][789][�][792]

Serum chloride may have a direct role in the control of renin secretion and the response to loop or thiazide diuretics. [439][,][793] The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide increases chloride
reabsorption causing a greater bicarbonate and sodium excretion in
the proximal tubule of the nephron. It can increase serum chloride
levels and diuresis in patients with severe HF at risk of diuretic resistance. [145][,][794] It is currently being tested in a multicentre randomized
study in decompensated HF. [469]


13.8 Lung disease, sleep-disordered

patients, inhaled corticosteroids and beta-adrenergic agonists do not

recommended. Because there is no evidence of harm in patients on

statin treatment after the occurrence of HF, there is no need for sta
tin discontinuation for patients already treated.

13.10 Gout and arthritis

Hyperuricemia is a common finding in patients with CHF with a prevalence up to 50%. [816][,][817] Hyperuricemia may be caused or aggravated
by diuretic treatment and it is related to symptoms, exercise capacity,
severity of diastolic dysfunction and long-term prognosis. [817][,][818] For
every 1 mg/dL increase in serum uric acid levels the risk of all-cause
mortality and of HF hospitalization increases by 4% and 28%, respectively. [819] Both febuxostat and allopurinol reduce uric acid levels.
However, allopurinol was associated with a lower rate of all-cause
death and CV death, compared with febuxostat, in a prospective,
multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority trial enrolling 6190 patients
with gout and CV disease, 20% with HF, with a median follow-up of
32 months. [820] Allopurinol is therefore recommended as the firstchoice urate-lowering drug in HF patients with no contraindication.
There is no evidence that uric acid-lowering treatment has beneficial
effects on LV function, symptoms or outcomes of patients with
HF. [821][�][823]

With respect to treatment of acute gout attacks, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can worsen renal function and
precipitate acute HF decompensation. Colchicine should be preferred as it is associated with less side effects. [824] However, it, too,

should be used with caution in patients with severe renal dysfunction
and is contraindicated in patients on dialysis. An increase in ventricular vulnerability was shown in experimental models. [825]

Arthritis is a common comorbidity and is a common cause of both
self-taken and prescribed NSAIDs. These agents are relatively contraindicated as they may precipitate acute decompensation in patients
with HF. [826] Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with a two- to three
fold increase in the risk of HF and this increased risk is independent
of ischaemic heart disease, suggesting a direct role in HF pathophysiology. [827][,][828] The safety of disease-modifying drugs used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has not been established in HF. High
doses of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha agents were associated
with worsening HF in initial trials and should be used with caution.
No adverse effects were noted with lower doses. [829][�][831]

13.11 Erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction is a serious problem in HF patients due to its
association with CV risk factors, comorbidities (e.g. diabetes), lifestyle (e.g. inactivity), and treatment (e.g. drugs). [832] In the general population, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction is estimated to be 50%
in men aged >_60, but erectile dysfunction can be present in up to
81% of cardiac patients across different cultures and ethnic groups. [833]

Optimal assessment should include both questions assessing the
presence of erectile dysfunction and factors that can be related to
erectile dysfunction. Numerous classes of CV drugs, particularly diuretics and beta-blockers, have been implicated causing erectile dysfunction. However, the relationships between many contemporary
CV drugs and erectile dysfunction is not clear. [834] For the treatment
of erectile dysfunction, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are gen
[834][,][835] No . [......................................................................................................................................................................]


studies have shown one agent to be more effective or safer than the
others. However, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors should not be
used in patients receiving nitrates and nitrates should not be administered to patients within 24 h of sildenafil or vardenafil administration
or within 48 h of tadalafil administration. [834]

13.12 Depression
Depression affects 20% of patients with HF and is severe in half of
them. Its occurrence is higher in women and it is associated with
worse clinical status and a poor prognosis. [836][�][838] Screening using a
validated questionnaire is recommended when there is a clinical suspicion of depression. The Beck Depression Inventory and Cardiac
Depression Scale are the tools formally validated for the assessment
of depression in patients with HF. Other questionnaires (e.g.
Geriatric Depression Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale) can also be used. [837][,][838]

There is still no consensus on the best therapy for HF patients
with depression. Psychosocial intervention may improve depressive
symptoms but has no effect on prognosis of depressed patients with
HF. [839] Depressive symptoms may improve with selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors but trials specifically designed to assess the effect
of these drugs in patients with HF and depression have failed to show
any significant benefit over placebo on both symptoms and outcomes. [840][,][841] Interestingly, patients improved also in the placebo arm
showing the importance of better care in these patients. Both trials
showed the safety of sertraline and escitalopram, respectively. [840][,][841]

Tricyclic antidepressants should be avoided for the treatment of
depression in HF as they may cause hypotension, worsening HF, and
arrhythmias. [837][,][838]

13.13 Cancer

HF occurs in patients with cancer as a result of the interaction among
anticancer therapy, cancer itself, and patients’ CV background (risk
factors and coexisting CV disease). [842][�][846] Several anticancer therapies may cause HF directly, thorough their cardiotoxic effects (Table
23), or, indirectly, through other mechanisms, such as myocarditis,
ischaemia, systemic or pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmias or valve
disease. [844][,][845][,][847][�][852] HF, in turn, may affect cancer outcomes by
depriving patients of effective anticancer therapies. [699] Some epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests a further reciprocal
interaction between cancer and HF with some, though not all, studies
showing a higher incidence rate of cancer in patients with HF. [853][�][858]

The prevention of HF in patients with cancer undergoing potential
cardiotoxic therapies requires careful patient’s assessment and management before, during, and after cancer therapy, preferably in the
context of an integrated Cardio-Oncology service
(Figure 18). [845][,][859][,][860] A CV baseline risk assessment for all patients
scheduled to receive potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies using
the HFA-ICOS risk assessment is advisable. [846] Baseline CV risk

assessment forms have been developed for different potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapies. History of HF or CMP characterizes
patients as being at very high risk or at high risk for all cancer therapies, except anti-androgen treatments for prostate cancer. An LVEF
<50% is an additional factor for high-risk patients and elevated levels


13.10 Gout and arthritis

Hyperuricemia is a common finding in patients with CHF with a prevalence up to 50%. [816][,][817] Hyperuricemia may be caused or aggravated
by diuretic treatment and it is related to symptoms, exercise capacity,
severity of diastolic dysfunction and long-term prognosis. [817][,][818] For
every 1 mg/dL increase in serum uric acid levels the risk of all-cause
mortality and of HF hospitalization increases by 4% and 28%, respectively. [819] Both febuxostat and allopurinol reduce uric acid levels.
However, allopurinol was associated with a lower rate of all-cause
death and CV death, compared with febuxostat, in a prospective,
multicentre, double-blind, non-inferiority trial enrolling 6190 patients
with gout and CV disease, 20% with HF, with a median follow-up of
32 months. [820] Allopurinol is therefore recommended as the firstchoice urate-lowering drug in HF patients with no contraindication.
There is no evidence that uric acid-lowering treatment has beneficial
effects on LV function, symptoms or outcomes of patients with
HF. [821][�][823]

With respect to treatment of acute gout attacks, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can worsen renal function and
precipitate acute HF decompensation. Colchicine should be preferred as it is associated with less side effects. [824] However, it, too,

should be used with caution in patients with severe renal dysfunction
and is contraindicated in patients on dialysis. An increase in ventricular vulnerability was shown in experimental models. [825]

Arthritis is a common comorbidity and is a common cause of both
self-taken and prescribed NSAIDs. These agents are relatively contraindicated as they may precipitate acute decompensation in patients
with HF. [826] Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with a two- to three
fold increase in the risk of HF and this increased risk is independent

doses of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha agents were associated
with worsening HF in initial trials and should be used with caution.
No adverse effects were noted with lower doses. [829][�][831]


13.11 Erectile dysfunction
Erectile dysfunction is a serious problem in HF patients due to its
association with CV risk factors, comorbidities (e.g. diabetes), lifestyle (e.g. inactivity), and treatment (e.g. drugs). [832] In the general population, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction is estimated to be 50%

presence of erectile dysfunction and factors that can be related to
erectile dysfunction. Numerous classes of CV drugs, particularly diuretics and beta-blockers, have been implicated causing erectile dysfunction. However, the relationships between many contemporary
CV drugs and erectile dysfunction is not clear. [834] For the treatment
of erectile dysfunction, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are generally safe and effective in patients with compensated HF. [834][,][835] No

of NPs or troponin at baseline are additional criteria of medium risk
for most of the cancer treatments. [846]

During cancer treatment with potential cardiotoxic therapies, LV
systolic function can be monitored through echocardiography.
Chemotherapy should be reconsidered and treatment with an ACE-I
and a beta-blocker (preferably carvedilol) should be started in
patients who develop LV systolic dysfunction, defined as 10% or
more absolute reduction in LVEF to a value below 50%. [844][,][861][�][864]

Global longitudinal strain can detect cardiac dysfunction at an earlier
stage. [865][,][866] A >_12% relative reduction in global longitudinal strain
was compared with an LVEF decline in a prospective randomized trial
in high-risk patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Compared to treatment based on LVEF, treatment based on
changes in global longitudinal strain led to the same decrease in LVEF
(primary endpoint) but with fewer patients who developed cardiac
dysfunction at the end of the study, thus suggesting usefulness of
global longitudinal strain for the early detection of cardiotoxicity. [867] . [..................................................]


Promising results for the early detection of cardiac dysfunction have
also been obtained through monitoring of biomarkers, such as NPs
and troponin. [868][,][869] Patients on immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors are at increased risk of myocarditis and should be
monitored for related symptoms and signs and by weekly assessment
of cardiac troponin during at least the first 6 weeks of therapy and
managed accordingly. [870]

Timing of the imaging procedures and biomarkers assessment
depend on the anticancer treatment and patient’s risk profile
(Figure 18). [865] In general, all patients scheduled for potential cardiotoxic therapies must undergo a baseline evaluation that would
define the level of risk for cardiotoxicity (low, medium, or high)
and the intensity of monitoring and follow-up during and after
cancer treatment. [865] Cancer survivors exposed to potentially
cardiotoxic therapies should be periodically monitored in the
long term as HF may develop several years after cancer
therapy. [865][,][871]

Pre-pregnancy management includes the modification of existing

HF medications to avoid foetal harm. ACE-Is, ARBs, ARNI, MRAs,

ivabradine, and SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated and should be

stopped prior to conception with close clinical and echocardiographic monitoring. Beta-blockers should be continued and switched
to beta-1-selective blockers (bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate).
Hydralazine, oral nitrates and methyldopa can be started if required.
Therapeutic anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin
(LMWH), in the first and last trimesters, and VKAs, with the usual target international normalized ratios (INRs) or LMWH for the second
trimester, is recommended for patients with HF and AF. DOACs
should be avoided. [884]

Assessment of patients with HF in pre-pregnancy or at presentation with a new pregnancy should include a clinical assessment
(symptoms, clinical examination, BP, SaO 2 ), ECG and resting echocardiography. The modalities of delivery should be planned by cardiologists, obstetricians, and anaesthesiologists around 35 weeks in a
multidisciplinary Pregnancy Heart Team. Bimonthly assessments for
women in mWHO II�III, and monthly assessments for women with
pre-existing HF in mWHO III, must be performed. Women with

advanced HF (LVEF <30%, NYHA class III IV) in mWHO IV who
are pregnant can be referred to a specialist centre for counselling
regarding any consideration of termination of pregnancy. The decision regarding modalities of delivery can be planned by cardiologists,

13.14 Infection

Infective disorders may worsen HF symptoms and be a precipitant
factor for AHF. [872][,][873] Severe sepsis and pneumonia can cause myocardial injury and depress cardiac function leading to cardiac dysfunction and HF and this risk is greater in patients with a history of
HF. [873][�][875] More recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality as well as of HF decompensation. [873][,][876][�][878] Specific guidance is
available. [879] General recommendations related to infections are

given in Table 24.

Influenza vaccination is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause

death in patients with HF in observational studies and retrospective
analyses. [880][�][882] Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, as well as

COVID-19 vaccination, when available, should be considered in
patients with HF. [879][,][883]

existing, but previously undiagnosed, causes of HF such as CMPs and
valve diseases. [885] Symptoms are more likely to occur in the second
trimester when the demand for an increased cardiac output is the
highest. Severe emotionally stressful episodes during pregnancy and
delivery can also cause Takotsubo syndrome. [884][,][885]
. [...............]


PPCM presents as HF secondary to LV systolic dysfunction, usually
shown by an LVEF <45%, occurring towards the end of pregnancy
(third trimester) or in the months following delivery without any
other identifiable cause. The majority of PPCM cases are diagnosed in
post-partum. The prevalence ranges from 1:100 in Nigeria to 1:1000

ESC Guidelines 3677


in South Africa and 1:1500 in Germany. [643] Prospective large cohort
studies report a 6-month mortality ranging from 2.0% in Germany to
12.6% in a 206 PPCM patient cohort from South Africa. [643]

PPCM frequently presents with acute HF but may also present
with ventricular arrhythmias and/or cardiac arrest. An LVEF <30%,

marked LV dilatation, LV end-diastolic diameter >6.0 cm, and RV
involvement are associated with adverse outcomes. [643] Cardiac

�
recovery may occur in the first 3 6 months though it may be
delayed to up to 2 years. Recovery rates vary among regions, from
75% to less than 50%. [886][�][888]

Assessment and management of pregnant patients presenting with
HF depends upon the clinical setting and severity of presentation.
Detailed cardiac assessment with echocardiography, NP levels, foetal
ultrasound and foetal monitoring is recommended. In cases of new
HF or if there is diagnostic uncertainty non-contrast CMR may be

considered.

Milder cases can be treated with oral diuretics, beta-blockers,

hydralazine and oral nitrates. Pregnant women presenting with signs
of acute HF require urgent hospital admission. In case of PPCM presenting with severe HF and cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic or
vasopressor support, transfer to an advanced HF centre, where
ECMO, LVAD and/or cardiac transplantation can be performed, is
recommended. Urgent delivery by caesarean section (irrespective of
gestation) should be considered with MCS immediately available.
Adrenergic agents (dobutamine, adrenaline) may have detrimental
effects. [889] When a PPCM patient is haemodynamically unstable, levosimendan or MCS may be considered. LVAD implantation as a BTT
or BTR should be considered in refractory cases of cardiogenic
shock. [643] Bromocriptine has been proposed for patients with acute
PPCM to reduce the production of a cleaved 16 kDa prolactin fragment, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of PPCM.
Bromocriptine was tested in a randomized trial in 63 patients comparing its long-term, 8 weeks, with its short-term, 1-week, treatment.
It was associated with recovery of LV function, with no difference
between the two regimens and in line with the results of a previous
international PPCM registry. [890][,][891] Bromocriptine may be considered
for treatment of PPCM. Untoward effects of treatment, including
deep venous thrombosis and cessation of lactation, must be considered if it is initiated. It should therefore be accompanied by prophylactic (or therapeutic) anticoagulation.

14.2 Cardiomyopathies
14.2.1 Epidemiology and diagnosis
CMPs can be either inherited (genetic/familial) and/or acquired. They
can also be accelerated by disease modifiers. [892][�][894] They are a heterogeneous group of diseases and are major causes of HF. [895] DCM has
an estimated prevalence of 1 in 250 to 1 in 500 of the general population, HCM ranges between 1 in 500 to 1 in 5000, and AC is estimated
to be present in around 1 in 1000 to 1 in 5000 persons. [895][,][896]

Direct causes of CMPs include pathogenic gene variants (mutations), toxins, auto-immunity, storage diseases, infections, and
tachyarrhythmias. Disease modifiers, conditions that may aggravate
or trigger a CMP, include epigenetic factors and acquired modifiers,

. [......................................................................................................................................................................]


consider this key interaction between genetic and acquired causes
during the diagnostic workup. [897] Identification of an acquired cause
of the CMP does not exclude an underlying pathogenic gene variant,
whereas the latter may require an additional acquired cause and/or
disease modifier to become manifest clinically. The commonest

causes and disease modifiers are shown in Table 25.

The key elements of the diagnostic workup for all patients with HF
and CMP are reported in Table 26. [892][,][894][,][895][,][898][,][899] Specifics aspects
of diagnosis and treatment are summarized in Tables 27�29. Clinical
history, laboratory tests, and imaging are the first-line investigations.
Echocardiography is central for the diagnosis and monitoring of
HCM, DCM, and AC. CMR imaging provides more detailed morphological and prognostic information and should be performed
at baseline. The prevalence of gene mutations may vary according
to the morphological phenotype or the underlying acquired
cause. Gene mutations occur in up to 40% of DCM, 60% of
HCM, and 15% in chemotherapy-induced, alcoholic or peripartum
CMPs. [895][,][898][,][900][�][905] The prevalence of genetic mutations is over
10% also in non-familial DCM. [898][,][906] Finding a pathogenic gene variant in a patient with CMP allows better prediction of the disease outcome and progression, may contribute to the indications for device
implantation and inform genetic counselling for families.
Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with immunohistochemical quantification of inflammatory cells remains the gold standard investigation
for the identification of cardiac inflammation. It may confirm the diagnosis of auto-immune disease in patients with DCM and suspected
giant cell myocarditis, eosinophilic myocarditis, vasculitis and sarcoidosis. [893][,][907] It may also help for the diagnosis of storage diseases,
including amyloid or Fabry disease, if imaging or genetic testing does
not provide a definitive diagnosis (see also section 14.6). EMB might
be considered also in HCM if genetic or acquired causes cannot be

identified. The risks and benefits of EBM should be evaluated and this

procedure should be reserved for specific situations where its results
may affect treatment.

14.2.2 Treatment

The current pharmacological treatment of HF in DCM, HCM, or AC
patients does not differ from general HF management, except for
peculiar aspects reported in Tables 27�29. A pilot randomized study,
TRED-HF, investigated the possibility of withdrawing medical treatment in those patients with non-ischaemic DCM who had had partial
to complete recovery of LVEF (>40%). However, relapse of DCM
within 6 months was observed in 44% of patients, and rapid LV
remodelling with early tissue and functional changes, even amongst
patients who did not relapse, was found. [271][,][908]

In a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
(EXPLORER-HCM), treatment with mavacamten improved exercise
capacity, LVOT obstruction, NYHA functional class, and health status
in patients with obstructive HCM. This offers the possibility of
disease-specific treatment for inherited CMPs. [909]

ICD implantation should be considered for patients with DCM,
HCM, or AC (see section 6). [895][,][910][�][912] The strength of the indication
varies according to the clinical risk factors for sudden cardiac death
with higher priority being given to those patients with significant LGE


PPCM frequently presents with acute HF but may also present
with ventricular arrhythmias and/or cardiac arrest. An LVEF <30%,

marked LV dilatation, LV end-diastolic diameter >6.0 cm, and RV
involvement are associated with adverse outcomes. [643] Cardiac

�
recovery may occur in the first 3 6 months though it may be
delayed to up to 2 years. Recovery rates vary among regions, from
75% to less than 50%. [886][�][888]

Assessment and management of pregnant patients presenting with
HF depends upon the clinical setting and severity of presentation.
Detailed cardiac assessment with echocardiography, NP levels, foetal
ultrasound and foetal monitoring is recommended. In cases of new
HF or if there is diagnostic uncertainty non-contrast CMR may be

considered.

Milder cases can be treated with oral diuretics, beta-blockers,

hydralazine and oral nitrates. Pregnant women presenting with signs
of acute HF require urgent hospital admission. In case of PPCM presenting with severe HF and cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic or
vasopressor support, transfer to an advanced HF centre, where
ECMO, LVAD and/or cardiac transplantation can be performed, is
recommended. Urgent delivery by caesarean section (irrespective of
gestation) should be considered with MCS immediately available.
Adrenergic agents (dobutamine, adrenaline) may have detrimental
effects. [889] When a PPCM patient is haemodynamically unstable, levosimendan or MCS may be considered. LVAD implantation as a BTT
or BTR should be considered in refractory cases of cardiogenic
shock. [643] Bromocriptine has been proposed for patients with acute
PPCM to reduce the production of a cleaved 16 kDa prolactin fragment, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of PPCM.
Bromocriptine was tested in a randomized trial in 63 patients comparing its long-term, 8 weeks, with its short-term, 1-week, treatment.
It was associated with recovery of LV function, with no difference
between the two regimens and in line with the results of a previous
international PPCM registry. [890][,][891] Bromocriptine may be considered
for treatment of PPCM. Untoward effects of treatment, including
deep venous thrombosis and cessation of lactation, must be considered if it is initiated. It should therefore be accompanied by prophylactic (or therapeutic) anticoagulation.

or trigger a CMP, include epigenetic factors and acquired modifiers,
such as pregnancy and most CV comorbidities. It is important to

14.3 Left ventricular non-compaction
LVNC is a very rare congenital CMP characterized by endomyocardial trabeculations that increase in number and prominence. In
most cases, including when the condition is caused by mutations
in the MYH7 or MYBPC3 gene, LVNC is inherited in an autosomal
dominant pattern. [644][,][937][,][938] A clear overlap exists in families with

3682 ESC Guidelines


DCM and HCM phenotypes. Quite commonly individuals with

features of LVNC are found in families where other affected rela
tives have typical HCM or DCM. Therefore, LVNC is not treated
as a separate disease entity, but as a separate rare presentation of
a genetic susceptibility to either HCM or DCM. [939]

14.4 Atrial disease

14.4.1 Definition

Atrial disease, also termed atrial failure or myopathy, can be defined
as a complex of subclinical structural, electrophysiological, and functional changes that affect the atria with the potential to produce
clinical consequences. [606][,][940][,][941] It has been suggested that atrial disease links the pathophysiology of HF, especially HFpEF, with AF, as
they often coexist, are closely inter-related and share common risk
factors. [606][,][685][,][942][,][943]

14.4.2 Diagnosis
Atrial size and function can be evaluated by multimodality imaging
including two- and three-dimensional echocardiography, myocardial deformation, computed tomography (CT) and CMR. [944]

Cardiac biomarkers, including high-sensitivity cardiac troponins
and NPs, may assess pathophysiological aspects of atrial disease. [945][�][947] The increased levels of NPs in AF may also be an indicator of an underlying atrial disease. [942][,][948] A comprehensive
characterization of atrial disease combining clinical, imaging, biochemical and molecular features is, however, still lacking.

14.4.3 Management
Atrial disease is an emerging therapeutic target in the prevention of
AF, systemic thromboembolism, and perhaps HFpEF. [949] As atrial

disease appears to result from the intersection of shared risk factors
and comorbidities predisposing to both AF and HF, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity may be of paramount importance for its development. [7][,][950] Effective management of
HF and AF (see section 12.1.1), as well as treatment of mitral regurgitation (see section 12.3.3), may also be important to counteract atrial
disease progression.

14.5 Myocarditis
14.5.1 Epidemiology and diagnosis
The incidence of acute myocarditis is estimated to be 1.5 million cases
per year globally. [951] The contribution of myocarditis as a cause of HF
varies by age and region from approximately 0.5% to 4.0%. [918][,][952]

Chronic, EMB proven, inflammation can be found in 9% to 30% of adult
patients with a DCM. [918][,][953] The most frequent potential aetiologies
triggering acute myocarditis in Europe are reported in Table 30.
The clinical presentation of acute myocarditis may vary from mild
symptoms to cardiogenic shock. Workup for the diagnosis of acute
myocarditis in patients with HF is reported in Table 31 and Figure 20.
Specific criteria about biopsies and CMR are reported in Tables 32

and 33.

14.5.2 Treatment

Hospitalization for at least 48 h may be useful for patients with acute
myocarditis and HF, especially when troponins are elevated and
when cardiac dysfunction, and/or arrhythmias are present at initial

presentation.
Despite the lack of evidence in the specific setting of acute myocarditis, treatment of HFrEF is recommended in the presence of systolic
LV dysfunction. Immunosuppression is only indicated in selected
cases of acute myocarditis (Table 34). Once cardiac enzymes
decrease, arrhythmias are absent, and cardiac systolic dysfunction is
stabilized, standard HF therapy should be continued for at least
6 months (see also Figure 20).
Immunosuppression has been considered for treatment of patients

with chronic cardiac inflammation at EMB and no evidence of active
viral infection. [918][,][919] This was associated with an improvement in car
diac function in small studies and with better outcomes in a retrospective observational study. [953][,][963][,][964] Prospective trials with old or
newer immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory drugs are needed. A
placebo-controlled trial testing the effects of immunoadsorption with
i.v. immunoglobulins on LV function is ongoing and other treatment
options are being tested. [919]

14.6 Amyloidosis
14.6.1 Epidemiology and diagnosis
CA or amyloid cardiomyopathy is still an underdiagnosed cause of
HF. [895][,][965][,][966] The two most prevalent forms of CA are light chain
immunoglobulin (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. ATTR
includes the wild-type (>90% of cases), and the hereditary or variant
type (<10% of cases). It is estimated that 6% to 16% of all patients

Therapy of AL-CA is based on treatment of the underlying haematological problem with chemotherapy or autologous stem-cell
transplant.
TTR stabilization and reduction of its production are the basis
of TTR-CA treatment. Liver and/or cardiac transplantation can be
considered only in end-stage disease of familial TTR-CA.
Tafamidis reduced all-cause mortality and CV hospitalizations in
cardiac or non-cardiac biopsy-proven hereditary and wtTTR-CA,
mainly in those patients with NYHA class I and II at baseline.
Functional improvement occurred within 6 months, whereas the
decrease in mortality took nearly 2 years to occur. [979][,][980]

Intravenous patisiran, a small RNA interfering molecule, or subcutaneous inotersen, antisense oligonucleotide against TTR, may be
considered in those patients with combined hTTRpolyneuropathy and CA (Figure 21). [981][,][982] Off-label use of diflunisal may be considered in wtTTR-CA in combination with a proton pump inhibitor. [983]

14.7 Iron overload cardiomyopathy
Iron overload results either from genetically determined increased
intestinal iron absorption in the context of hereditary haemochromatosis (primary iron overload) or from multiple blood transfusions required for the management of haematological conditions
such as beta-thalassaemia (secondary iron overload). [984] In iron
overload, the iron binding capacity of transferrin is saturated and
non-transferrin-bound iron enters cardiomyocytes through Ltype calcium channels, causing oxidative myocardial damage. [985]

a It takes at least 3 months before CMR signs of oedema (secondary to inflammation in the acute phase/baseline) disappear. At 6 months, T1 or T2 signs of
oedema should have disappeared if inflammation would be completely absent.
Still, the absence of T1 or T2 oedema does not exclude chronic low-grade
inflammation.

(Figure 21). [973]

14.6.2 Therapy of amyloidosis and heart failure
Maintenance of euvolaemia is central to management but is challenging due to the markedly reduced ventricular capacitance. [977] If
HF symptoms are present, a loop diuretic, possibly with an MRA,
may be given, but orthostatic hypotension may cause intolerance.
Beta-blockers, digitalis, ACE-I, ARBs, or ARNI may not be well tolerated because of hypotension, and their place in CA treatment is

unsettled. Their withdrawal must be often considered due to
hypotension and/or bradycardia. [973][,][974] CCB should be avoided as
they may cause severe hypotension and fatigue, or form complexes with amyloid. [966]

Amyloid infiltration of the atrial wall leads to atrial myopathy
and electromechanical dissociation with high embolic risk.
Patients with CA and history of AF should receive anticoagulation.
There is no evidence to support anticoagulation for patients
in SR, yet. [7][,][978] Amiodarone is the preferred antiarrhythmic
agent. [973]

cardiomyopathy (IOCM), which may have either a restrictive or a
dilated phenotype, the former potentially evolving to the latter as
the disease advances. Myocardial iron deposition can be accurately estimated by the CMRT2* technique; T2* values are correlated with left and right ventricular systolic function and predict
the development of iron-induced HF or arrhythmias. [984]

Prevention of IOCM is successfully accomplished with iron chelators, including deferoxamine, deferiprone, and deferasirox, while
established IOCM may be completely reversed by intensified and
combined iron chelation therapy. [985]

14.8 Adult congenital heart disease
The management of ACHD has been reviewed in detail in a recent
ESC guideline. [988] HF is a common problem affecting 20�50% of
the ACHD population, and an important cause of death. [989] The
pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in ACHD is often different
from non-congenital (acquired) heart disease, in particular in
those with: a systemic right ventricle (RV), a failing subpulmonary
ventricle, a single ventricle, [988] surgery-related injury, chronic
pressure/volume overload in systemic and sub-pulmonary
ventricles, and those with hypertrophy or non-compaction
induced by gene mutations. Therefore, extrapolation
of current HF treatment guidelines to ACHD patients is not
always appropriate. In addition, the few available data on HF treatments in ACHD patients are often inconclusive and are derived
from small patient cohorts. As a consequence, ACHD specific
recommendations are mostly based on clinical experience or
position statements. [990]

Importantly, ACHD patients with HF should be referred to expert
centres. The general principles of management, while awaiting transfer to specialist centres, is summarized in Table 36.

### 15 Key messages

(1) Patients with HF are classified based on their LVEF. Those with a

LVEF between 41% and 49% are defined as ‘mildly reduced LVEF’

(HFmrEF).

(2) Measurement of NPs and echocardiography have key roles in the

diagnosis of HF.


. [..........................................................................................................................................................]


(3) ACE-I or ARNI, beta-blockers, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitors are

recommended as cornerstone therapies for patients with HFrEF.

(4) ICDs are recommended in selected patients with HFrEF of an

ischaemic aetiology and should be considered in those with a non
ischaemic aetiology.

(5) CRT-P/D is recommended in those patients with HFrEF, in sinus

rhythm, with a LBBB >_150 ms and should be considered in those

�
with a LBBB >_130 149 ms or non-LBBB >_150 ms.

(6) Advanced HF strategies (heart transplantation/MCS) may be

appropriate in selected patients.

(7) ACE-I/ARNI, beta-blockers, and MRA may be considered in

patients with HFmrEF.

(8) The diagnosis of HFpEF requires objective evidence of cardiac

structural, or functional abnormalities as well as elevated plasma

NP concentrations consistent with the presence of LV diastolic

dysfunction and raised LV filling pressures. A diastolic stress test is

recommended when these markers are equivocal.

(9) To date, no treatment has been shown to reduce mortality and

morbidity in patients with HFpEF.

(10) It is recommended that all patients with HF be enrolled in a multi
disciplinary HF-MP.

(11) Exercise is recommended for all patients who are able, to improve

exercise capacity and QOL, and reduce HF hospitalization.

(12) Patients with advanced HF refractory to medical/device therapy

and who do not have absolute contraindications should be

referred for consideration of heart transplantation. MCS should

also be considered as BTT or DT in selected patients.

(13) Four major clinical presentations of acute HF may occur: ADHF,

acute pulmonary oedema, RV failure, and cardiogenic shock.

(14) Treatment of acute HF is based on diuretics for congestion, ino
tropes, and short- term MCS for peripheral hypoperfusion.

(15) Patients hospitalized for HF should be carefully evaluated to

exclude persistent signs of congestion. Oral treatment should be

optimized before discharge.

(16) In addition to oral anticoagulation, a strategy of rhythm control

including catheter ablation should be considered in patients whose

symptoms and/or cardiac dysfunction are associated with AF.

(17) SAVR or TAVI, as advised by the Heart Team, are recommended

in patients with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis.

(18) Patients with isolated significant SMR and COAPT criteria should

be considered for percutaneous edge-to-edge repair, whereas

those with SMR and CAD, who need revascularization, should be

### 16 Gaps in evidence

Major advances in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with HF
have occurred over recent years. Strong evidence for new treatment
options have been given by recent RCTs and HF management may
undergo major changes in the next years. New discoveries, however,
pose new challenges and many areas with lack of evidence still
remain. The following is a short list of selected, common issues that

deserve to be addressed in future clinical research.

(1) Definition and epidemiology

i. Further research into the underlying characteristics, patho
physiology, and diagnosis of HFmrEF and HFpEF

ii. Consensus about normal values/ranges of EF

iii. Better phenotyping of HFpEF

iv. More information on the incidence and prevalence of

‘recovered LV’ systolic function

(2) Diagnosis

i. Definitive studies on the role of biomarkers, focusing on their

additive value in the diagnosis of HF

ii. More randomized studies on screening for HF in asympto
matic subjects that may translate into improved outcomes

iii. Studies on biomarkers showing the impact on outcome of their

measurements for the identification of subjects at risk of devel
oping HF as well as to guide treatment in patients with HF

iv. Validated diagnostic protocols for the diagnosis of HFmrEF

and HFpEF

(3) Pharmacotherapy of CHF

i. Pragmatic studies on the order of adding disease-modifying

drugs for HFrEF

ii. Specific therapies for HFmrEF and HFpEF and, likely, their dif
ferent phenotypes

iii. More data and prospective clinical trials of HFrEF therapies in
patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m [2]

iv. Further evidence from prospective RCTs for the treatment of

specific HF phenotypes: myocarditis, cardiotoxicity, inherited

CMPs, PPCM, amyloidosis

v. Management strategies and therapies for ‘recovered LV’ sys
tolic function

vi. More evidence on the effects of fluid restriction, dietary salt

restriction, and nutrition

(4) Devices and interventions

i. Indications for ICDs in specific subgroups of HFmrEF/HFpEF

and optimal selection of ICD candidates in HFrEF, including

patients with ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy

ii. More research on CRT efficacy in AF

iii. Further prospective randomized studies showing the impact

on outcomes of AF ablation strategies compared to OMT in

HF patients

iv. Further research on the percutaneous treatment of valve

heart disease and its impact on patients’ outcomes and QOL

v. Larger RCTs on CCM and baroreceptor stimulation in HFrEF

(5) Disease management

### 18 Quality indicators

QIs are tools that may be used to evaluate care quality, including
that of processes of care and clinical outcomes. [995] They may
also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to guideline
recommendations, through quality assurance endeavours and benchmarking of care providers. [996] As such, the role of QIs in driving quality improvement is increasingly recognized and attracts interest from
healthcare authorities, professional organizations, payers, and the
public. [997]

The ESC recognizes the need for measuring and reporting quality
and outcomes of CV care. The methodology by which the ESC QIs . [...................................]


are developed has been published [997] and, to date, a suite of QIs for
an initial tranche of CV conditions has been produced. [998][,][999] To facilitate quality improvement initiatives, the disease-specific ESC QIs are
included in corresponding ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines. [7][,][1000] This
is further enhanced by way of their integration in the ESC registries,
such as the EURObservational Research Programme (EORP) and the
European Unified Registries On Heart Care Evaluation and
Randomized Trials (EuroHeart) project. [1001]

For patients with HF, QIs may help healthcare providers to simultaneously operationalize discrete guideline recommendations and
enable the discrimination between missed opportunities and appropriate care. Furthermore, QIs allow the capture of patients’
