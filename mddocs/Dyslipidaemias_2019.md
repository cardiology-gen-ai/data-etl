### 1 Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management
strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines
and their recommendations should facilitate decision making of
health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and

caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and its partners such as
European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS), as well as by other societies
and organisations. Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality
criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in
order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on
[the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.

The ESC carries out a number of registries which are essential to
assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources and adherence to Guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world, based
on data collected during routine clinical practice.
The guidelines are developed together with derivative educational
material addressing the cultural and professional needs for cardiologists and allied professionals. Collecting high-quality observational
data, at appropriate time interval following the release of ESC
Guidelines, will help evaluate the level of implementation of the
Guidelines, checking in priority the key end points defined with the

ESC Guidelines and Education Committees and Task Force members

in charge.
The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC and
EAS, including representation from relevant ESC sub-specialty
groups, in order to represent professionals involved with the medical
care of patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field from

ESC/EAS Guidelines 117


both societies undertook a comprehensive review of the published
evidence for management of a given condition according to ESC
Committee for Practice Guidelines (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation
of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including

assessment of the risk�benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the

strength of the recommendation of particular management options
were weighed and graded according to predefined ESC scales, as out
lined in the tables below.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. These forms were
[compiled into one file and can be found on the ESC website (http://](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[www.escardio.org/guidelines). Any changes in declarations of interest](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC and EAS
Chairpersons and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from the ESC and EAS without any involvement from
the healthcare industry. . [...................................................]

Table 1 Classes of recommendations


The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
Guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement
process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive
review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions
the Guidelines are approved by all the experts involved in the Task
Force. The finalized document is approved by the CPG and EAS for
publication in the European Heart Journal and Atherosclerosis
Journal. The Guidelines were developed after careful consideration
of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at
the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC/EAS Guidelines also includes the creation of educational tools and implementation programmes for the
recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions,
summary slides, booklets with essential messages, summary cards for
non-specialists and an electronic version for digital applications
(smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus, for more
detailed information, the user should always access the full text

version of the Guidelines, which is freely available via the ESC and
EAS websites and hosted on their journals’ websites (EHJ and
Atherosclerosis Journal). The National Cardiac Societies of the ESC
are encouraged to endorse, translate and implement all ESC
Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed because it has
been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC/EAS
Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment,
as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive,
diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC/EAS
Guidelines do not override in any way whatsoever the individual
responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and
in consultation with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where
appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional’s
responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each
country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.
### 2 Introduction

The previous ESC/EAS lipid Guidelines were published in August
2016. [1] The emergence of a substantial body of evidence over the last
few years has required new, up-to-date Guidelines.

New evidence has confirmed that the key initiating event in atherogenesis is the retention of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) and other cholesterol-rich apolipoprotein (Apo) Bcontaining lipoproteins within the arterial wall. [2] Several recent
placebo-controlled clinical studies have shown that the addition of
either ezetimibe or anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to statin therapy provides a
further reduction in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)
risk, which is directly and positively correlated with the incrementally

achieved absolute LDL-C reduction. Furthermore, these clinical trials

have clearly indicated that the lower the achieved LDL-C values, the
lower the risk of future cardiovascular (CV) events, with no lower
limit for LDL-C values, or ‘J’-curve effect. In addition, studies of the
clinical safety of these very low achieved LDL-C values have proved
reassuring, albeit monitoring for longer periods is required. For raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C), recent studies have indicated that the currently available therapies do not reduce
the risk of ASCVD. Finally, human Mendelian randomization studies

have demonstrated the critical role of LDL-C, and other cholesterol
rich ApoB-containing lipoproteins, in atherosclerotic plaque formation and related subsequent CV events. Thus, there is no longer an
‘LDL-C hypothesis’, but established facts that increased LDL-C values
are causally related to ASCVD, and that lowering LDL particles and
other ApoB-containing lipoproteins as much as possible reduces CV

events.

In order to be aligned with these new findings, the ESC/EAS Task
Force members who have written these Guidelines have proposed
new LDL-C goals, as well as a revised CV risk stratification, which are
especially relevant to high- and very-high-risk patients.
These novel ESC/EAS Guidelines on lipids provide important new
advice on patient management, which should enable more clinicians

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


2.1 What is new in the 2019 Guidelines?

New recommendations, and new and revised concepts, are pre
sented in Table 3.
### 3 What is cardiovascular disease prevention?

3.1 Definition and rationale

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), of which ASCVD is the major component, is responsible for >4 million deaths in Europe each year. It kills
more women (2.2 million) than men (1.8 million), although CV deaths
before the age of 65 years are more common in men (490000 vs.
193000). [3] Prevention is defined as a co-ordinated set of actions,
either at the population or individual level, aimed at eliminating or minimizing the impact of CV diseases and their related disabilities. More
patients are surviving their first CVD event and are at high-risk of
recurrences. In addition, the prevalence of some risk factors, notably
diabetes (DM) and obesity, is increasing. The importance of ASCVD
prevention remains undisputed and should be delivered at the general
population level by promoting healthy lifestyle behaviour, [4] and at the
individual level by tackling unhealthy lifestyles and by reducing

increased levels of causal CV risk factors, such as LDL cholesterol or

blood pressure (BP) levels.

3.2 Development of the Joint Task Force
Guidelines for the management of
dyslipidaemias
The present Guidelines represent an evidence-based consensus of
the European Task Force, including the ESC and the EAS.
By appraising the current evidence and identifying remaining
knowledge gaps in the management of dyslipidaemias, the Task Force
has formulated recommendations to guide action in clinical practice
to prevent ASCVD by modifying plasma lipid levels.
This document has been developed for healthcare professionals to

facilitate informed communication with individuals about their CV

risk and the benefits of adopting and sustaining a healthy lifestyle, and
of early modification of their lipid-related CV risk. In addition, the
Guidelines provide tools for healthcare professionals to promote upto-date intervention strategies, integrate these strategies into national
or regional prevention frameworks, and to translate them into locally

delivered healthcare services, in line with the recommendations of

the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Status Report on
Noncommunicable Diseases 2014. [5]

A lifetime approach to CV risk should be considered. [1] This implies
that—apart from improving lifestyle habits and reducing risk factor
levels in patients with established ASCVD, and in those at increased
risk of developing ASCVD—people of all ages should be encouraged
to adopt or sustain a healthy lifestyle.
### 4 Total cardiovascular risk

4.1 Total cardiovascular risk estimation

CV risk in the context of these Guidelines means the likelihood of a

person developing an atherosclerotic CV event over a defined period

of time. Total CVD risk expresses the combined effect of a number

of risk factors on this risk estimate. In these Guidelines, we address

the lipid-related contribution to total CV risk and how to manage it

at the clinical level.

4.1.1 Rationale for assessing total cardiovascular disease

risk

All current guidelines on the prevention of ASCVD in clinical practice

recommend the assessment of total CVD risk. Prevention of ASCVD

in a given person should relate to his or her total CV risk: the higher

the risk, the more intense the action should be.

Many risk assessment systems are available and have been compre[hensively reviewed (Supplementary Table 1 in the Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455#supplementary-data)
[Data). Most guidelines use one of these risk assessment systems.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455#supplementary-data) [6][�][8]

Ideally, risk charts should be based on country-specific cohort data.
These are not available for most countries. The SCORE (Systematic
Coronary Risk Estimation) system can be recalibrated for use in different populations by adjusting for secular changes in CVD mortality
and risk factor prevalence. Calibrated country-specific versions are
[available for many European countries and can be found at http://](http://www.heartscore.org)
[www.heartscore.org. These are now being updated to provide recali-](http://www.heartscore.org)
brated, contemporaneous country-specific charts for all European
countries. Other risk estimation systems—using both fatal and nonfatal events—can also be recalibrated, but the process is easier and
scientifically more robust for mortality than for total events. The
European Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice (both
the 2012 [9] and 2016 [10] versions) recommend the use of the SCORE
system because it is based on large, representative European cohort
data sets and because it is relatively straightforward to recalibrate for

individual countries.

Persons with documented ASCVD, type 1 or type 2 DM (T1DM
and T2DM, respectively), very high levels of individual risk factors, or
chronic kidney disease (CKD) are generally at very-high or high total
CV risk. No risk estimation models are needed for such persons;
they all need active management of all risk factors. For other, apparently healthy people, the use of a risk estimation system such as
SCORE, which estimates the 10 year cumulative risk of a first fatal

atherosclerotic event, is recommended to estimate total CV risk,

since many people have several risk factors that, in combination, may
result in high levels of total CV risk.
Risk estimates have been produced as charts for high- and low-risk
regions in Europe (Figures 1 and 2). [11] All International Classification of
Diseases codes that are related to deaths from vascular origin caused
by atherosclerosis are included. The reasons for retaining a system
that estimates fatal as opposed to total fatal þ non-fatal events are
that non-fatal events are dependent on definition, developments in . [..........................................................................................................................................]


diagnostic tests, and methods of ascertainment, all of which can vary,
resulting in very variable multipliers to convert fatal to total events. In
addition, total event charts, in contrast to those based on mortality,
are more difficult to recalibrate to suit different populations. That said,
work is in progress to produce regional total event charts.

The SCORE data indicate that the total CVD event risk is about

three times higher than the risk of fatal CVD for men, so a SCORE
risk of 5% translates into a CVD risk of �15% of total (fatal þ nonfatal) CVD endpoints; the multiplier is higher in women and lower in
older people.
Clinicians often ask for thresholds to trigger certain interventions.
This is problematic since risk is a continuum and there is no threshold
at which, for example, a drug is automatically indicated. This is true
for all continuous risk factors such as plasma cholesterol or systolic
BP (SBP). Therefore, the goals that are proposed in this document
reflect this concept.
A particular problem relates to young people with high levels of risk
factors; a low absolute risk may conceal a very high relative risk requiring at least intensive lifestyle advice. To motivate young people (i.e.
aged <40 years) not to delay changing their unhealthy lifestyle, an estimate of their relative risk—illustrating that lifestyle changes can reduce
[relative risk substantially—may be helpful (Supplementary Figure 1).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455#supplementary-data)
Another approach to this problem is to use CV risk age. The risk
age of a person with several CV risk factors is the age of a person

with the same level of risk but with ideal levels of risk factors. Thus, a

high-risk 40-year-old would have a risk age >_65 years. Risk age can be
estimated visually by looking at the SCORE chart (as illustrated in
[Supplementary Figure 2). In this chart, the risk age of a person with risk](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455#supplementary-data)
factors is defined as the age at which a person with ideal risk factor

levels would reach the same risk level. Ideal risk factors are non
smoking, total cholesterol (TC) <_4 mmol/L (<_155 mg/dL), and SBP
<_120 mmHg. Risk age is also automatically calculated as part of the
[latest revision of HeartScore (http://www.HeartScore.org).](http://www.HeartScore.org)

Risk age has been shown to be independent of the CV endpoint
used, [6][,][8] can be used in any population regardless of baseline risk or
secular changes in mortality, and therefore avoids the need for

recalibration.

Lifetime risk is another approach to illustrate the impact of risk factors that may be useful in younger people. [12] The greater the burden
of risk factors, the higher the lifetime risk. This approach produces
higher risk figures for younger people because of their longer exposure times. Therefore, it is more useful as a way of illustrating risk
than as a guide to treatment, because therapeutic trials have been
based on a fixed follow-up period and not on lifetime risk.

Another problem relates to older people. In some age categories,
the majority of people, especially males, will have estimated 10 year

cumulative CV death risks exceeding the 5 10% level, based on age
only, even when other CV risk factor levels are relatively low.
Therefore, before initiating treatment in the elderly, clinicians should
evaluate patients carefully. The relative strengths of risk factors vary
with age and SCORE overestimates risk in older people (that is, those
aged >65 years). [11] These Guidelines include illustrative charts for
older people (see Figures 1 and 2). While older people benefit from
smoking cessation, and control of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia
(see section 9.3), clinical judgement is required to avoid side effects

from overmedication.

The additional impact of HDL-C on risk estimation is illustrated in
[Supplementary Figures 3 and 4; HDL-C can be used to increase the](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455#supplementary-data)
accuracy of the risk evaluation. In these charts, HDL-C is used cate[gorically. The electronic version of SCORE, HeartScore (http://www.](http://www.heartscore.org/en_GB/)
[heartscore.org/en_GB/), has been modified to take HDL-C into con-](http://www.heartscore.org/en_GB/)

sideration as a continuous variable. Clinicians should be aware that at

extremely high values [above �2.3 mmol/L (90 mg/dL)] of HDL-C
there appears to be an increased risk of ASCVD, so at such levels
HDL-C cannot be used as a risk predictor.

4.1.2 How to use the risk estimation charts

Use of the low- or the high-risk SCORE charts will depend on the
CVD mortality experience in each country. While any cut-off point is
arbitrary and open to debate, in these Guidelines, the cut-off point
for calling a country ‘low CVD risk’ is based on WHO data derived
from the Global Burden of Disease Study.
Countries are categorized as low-risk if their age-adjusted 2016
CVD mortality rate was <150/100 000 (for men and women
[together) (http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/esti](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/)
[mates/en/). Countries with a CVD mortality rate of >_150/100 000 or](http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/estimates/en/)
more are considered to be at high-risk.

ESC/EAS Guidelines 125


Social deprivation and psychosocial stress set the scene for
increased risk. [13] For those at moderate risk, other factors—including
metabolic factors such as increased ApoB, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], triglycerides (TGs), or C-reactive protein; the presence of albuminuria;
the presence of atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid or femoral
arteries; or the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score—may improve
risk classification. Many other biomarkers are also associated with
increased CVD risk, although few of these have been shown to be
associated with appreciable reclassification. Total CV risk will also be
higher than indicated in the SCORE charts in asymptomatic persons

with abnormal markers of subclinical atherosclerotic vascular dam
age. Reclassification is of value in people identified as being at moder. [.....................................]
ate CV risk by using markers such as CAC score >100 Agatston
units, ankle�brachial index (ABI) <0.9 or >1.40, carotid�femoral
pulse wave velocity >10 m/s, or the presence of plaques at carotid or
femoral ultrasonography. In studies comparing these markers, CAC
had the best reclassification ability. [14][�][16]

Some factors such as a high HDL-C up to 2.3 mmol/L (90mg/dL) [17]

or a family history of longevity can also be associated with lower risk.

4.2 Risk levels

A total CV risk estimate is part of a continuum. The cut-off points
that are used to define high-risk are, in part, both arbitrary and based

on the risk levels at which benefit is evident in clinical trials. In clinical

practice, consideration should be given to practical issues in relation
to the local healthcare systems. Not only should those at high risk be
identified and managed, but those at moderate risk should also
receive professional advice regarding lifestyle changes; in some cases,
drug therapy will be needed to reduce atherosclerotic risk.


Low-risk people should be given advice to help them maintain this
status. Thus, the intensity of preventive actions should be tailored to
the patient’s total CV risk. The strongest driver of total CV risk is age,
which can be considered as ‘exposure time’ to risk factors.
For these reasons, the Task Force suggests the following categories of risk and LDL-C goals, based on the best available evidence and
in an ideal setting with unlimited resources. These categories represent a counsel of perfection, but these ideals are for guidance only
and practical decision-making must be based on what is appropriate

to the local situation.

With these considerations, we propose the levels of total CV risk
presented in Table 4.

4.2.1 Role of non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques in the assessment of total cardiovascular disease risk
Non-invasive imaging techniques can detect the presence, estimate
the extent, and evaluate the clinical consequences of atherosclerotic
vascular damage. Detection of coronary artery calcification with noncontrast computed tomography (CT) gives a good estimate of the
atherosclerotic burden and is strongly associated with CV events. [18]

A recent meta-analysis from the US Preventive Services Task Force

summarized the available evidence on the value of non-traditional

risk factors for risk prediction, and found that, although there are no
randomized trials showing that the use of CAC reduces health outcomes, nevertheless it improves both discrimination and . [....................................]


reclassification. [19] Assessment of carotid or femoral plaque burden
with ultrasound has also been demonstrated to be predictive of CV
events, comparable to CAC, [20][�][23] while the measurement of the carotid intima�media thickness is inferior to CAC score and carotid plaque detection. [16][,][24][,][25]

In asymptomatic patients at low or moderate risk who would be
eligible for statin therapy (see Table 5), assessment of ASCVD with
imaging may have an impact on medical treatment, both from the
physician’s and the patient’s points of view. Data from the MultiEthnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) showed that 41�57% of
individuals who would be eligible for statin therapy had a CAC score
of zero and the rate of atherosclerotic CVD events in the 10 year

hypercholesterolaemia (FH), including homozygous FH (HoFH), and
has low specificity in this population.

Assessment of coronary luminal stenosis >50% and plaque composition with coronary CT angiography also provides incremental
prognostic value over traditional risk stratification models. [28] As a
result, in asymptomatic individuals with moderate risk, the presence
of a CAC score >100 Agatston, and carotid or femoral plaque burden on ultrasonography, may reclassify them to a higher risk category. Therefore, the use of methods to detect these markers should
be of interest in that group (see Recommendations for cardiovascular
imaging for risk assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
below). [14][�][16] Overall, CAC score assessment with CT may be considered in individuals at low or moderate risk in whom the respective
LDL-C goal is not achieved with lifestyle intervention alone, and pharmacological therapy is an option (see Table 5). The use of imaging
techniques to determine the presence and extent of atherosclerotic
vascular damage in low-risk individuals not being considered for statin
therapy is not justified due to low prognostic yield, and the associated
costs and radiation hazards when measuring CAC score, particularly
among low-risk women. [29] Of note, CAC score is increased following
statin treatment; therefore, the CAC scores of statin-treated patients
should be interpreted with caution.

### 5 Lipids and lipoproteins

5.1 Biological role of lipids and
lipoproteins
Lipoproteins in plasma transport lipids to tissues for energy utilization, lipid deposition, steroid hormone production, and bile acid formation. Lipoproteins consist of esterified and unesterified
cholesterol, TGs, and phospholipids and protein components named
apolipoproteins that act as structural components, ligands for cellular
receptor binding, and enzyme activators or inhibitors.
There are six major lipoproteins in blood: chylomicrons, very lowdensity lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL),
[LDL; Lp(a), and HDL (Table 6 and Supplementary Figure 5).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455#supplementary-data)

5.2 Role of lipids and lipoproteins in the
pathophysiology of atherosclerosis
All ApoB-containing lipoproteins <70 nm in diameter, including
smaller TG-rich lipoproteins and their remnant particles, can cross
the endothelial barrier, especially in the presence of endothelial dysfunction, where they can become trapped after interaction with
extracellular structures such as proteoglycans. [42] ApoB-containing


reduction is proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL-C and the
absolute reduction in LDL-C resulting from a particular drug regimen
depends only on baseline LDL-C, at any given level of baseline risk the
higher the initial LDL-C level the greater the absolute reduction in
risk. Advice on individual drug treatments is given in section 8.

lipoproteins retained in the arterial wall provoke a complex process
that leads to lipid deposition and the initiation of an atheroma. [43]

Continued exposure to ApoB-containing lipoproteins leads to
additional particles being retained over time in the artery wall, and to
the growth and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. On average,
people with higher concentrations of plasma ApoB-containing lipoproteins will retain more particles and accumulate lipids faster, resulting in more rapid growth and the progression of atherosclerotic
plaques.
Because atherosclerotic plaques grow over time as additional
ApoB-containing lipoprotein particles are retained, the size of the
total atherosclerotic plaque burden is likely to be determined by
both the concentration of circulating LDL-C and other ApoB-containing lipoproteins, and by the total duration of exposure to these
lipoproteins. Therefore, a person’s total atherosclerotic plaque burden is likely to be proportional to the cumulative exposure to these
lipoproteins. [44]

Eventually, the increase of the atherosclerotic plaque burden along
with changes in the composition of the plaque reaches a critical point
at which disruption of a plaque can result, with the formation of an
overlying thrombus that acutely obstructs blood flow resulting in
unstable angina, myocardial infarction (MI), or death. Therefore, the
risk of experiencing an acute ASCVD event rises rapidly as more
ApoB-containing lipoproteins become retained and the atherosclerotic
plaque burden increases. This provides the rationale for encouraging a
healthy lifestyle to maintain low levels of ApoB-containing lipoproteins
throughout life to slow the progression of atherosclerosis; it also
explains the motivation to recommend treatment to lower LDL-C and
other ApoB-containing lipoproteins, for both the primary prevention
of ASCVD and the secondary prevention of recurrent CV events. [44]

5.3 Evidence for the causal effects of
lipids and lipoproteins on the risk of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

5.3.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of

atherosclerosis

Plasma LDL-C is a measure of the cholesterol mass carried by LDL
particles, by far the most numerous of the ApoB-containing lipoproteins, and is an estimate of the concentration of circulating LDL.
Numerous epidemiological studies, Mendelian randomization studies,

. [.............................................................................................................................]


between the absolute changes in plasma LDL-C and the risk of
ASCVD. [34][,][45][�][50] The remarkable consistency among these studies, in
addition to biological and experimental evidence, provides compelling evidence that LDL-C is causally associated with the risk of
ASCVD, and that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of ASCVD proportionally to the absolute achieved reduction in LDL-C. [2][,][51]

Furthermore, Mendelian randomization studies have demon
strated that long-term exposure to lower LDL-C levels is associated
with a much lower risk of CV events as compared with shorter-term
exposure to lower LDL-C (as achieved, for example, in randomized
trials). [48][,][52] These data provide strong support for the concept that
LDL particles have both a causal and cumulative effect on the risk of

ASCVD. Therefore, the effect of LDL-C on the risk of ASCVD

appears to be determined by both the absolute magnitude and the
total duration of exposure to LDL-C. [2]

The clinical benefit of lowering LDL-C is determined by the reduction in circulating LDL particles as estimated by ApoB, which is usually
mirrored by a reduction of cholesterol carried by those particles. [2][,][53]

Therefore, the clinical benefit of therapies that lower LDL-C by
reducing LDL particle mass will be proportional to the absolute
reduction in LDL-C, because—on average—the reduction in LDL-C
and LDL particles will be concordant. [34][,][50][,][54][,][55] In contrast, the clinical
benefit of therapies that lower LDL-C by a mechanism that may dramatically modify their composition may not be proportional to the

observed absolute reduction in LDL-C, but instead would be

expected to be proportional to the absolute change in LDL particle
concentration as measured by a reduction in ApoB. [2][,][53]

5.3.2 Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and risk of

atherosclerosis

TG-rich VLDL particles and their remnants carry most of the circulating TGs. Therefore, the plasma TG concentration reflects the concentration of circulating ApoB-containing TG-rich lipoproteins.
Elevated plasma TG levels are associated with an increasing risk of
ASCVD, but this association becomes null after adjusting for nonHDL-C, an estimate of the total concentration of all ApoB-containing
lipoproteins. [45] Similarly, lowering TG with fibrates reduces the risk of
CV events by the same amount as LDL-C-lowering therapies when
measured per unit change of non-HDL-C, [50] suggesting that the effect
of plasma TGs on ASCVD is mediated by changes in the concentration of TG-rich lipoproteins as estimated by non-HDL-C.


Continued exposure to ApoB-containing lipoproteins leads to
additional particles being retained over time in the artery wall, and to
the growth and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. On average,
people with higher concentrations of plasma ApoB-containing lipoproteins will retain more particles and accumulate lipids faster, resulting in more rapid growth and the progression of atherosclerotic
plaques.
Because atherosclerotic plaques grow over time as additional
ApoB-containing lipoprotein particles are retained, the size of the
total atherosclerotic plaque burden is likely to be determined by
both the concentration of circulating LDL-C and other ApoB-containing lipoproteins, and by the total duration of exposure to these
lipoproteins. Therefore, a person’s total atherosclerotic plaque burden is likely to be proportional to the cumulative exposure to these
lipoproteins. [44]

Eventually, the increase of the atherosclerotic plaque burden along
with changes in the composition of the plaque reaches a critical point
at which disruption of a plaque can result, with the formation of an
overlying thrombus that acutely obstructs blood flow resulting in
unstable angina, myocardial infarction (MI), or death. Therefore, the
risk of experiencing an acute ASCVD event rises rapidly as more
ApoB-containing lipoproteins become retained and the atherosclerotic
plaque burden increases. This provides the rationale for encouraging a
healthy lifestyle to maintain low levels of ApoB-containing lipoproteins
throughout life to slow the progression of atherosclerosis; it also
explains the motivation to recommend treatment to lower LDL-C and
other ApoB-containing lipoproteins, for both the primary prevention
of ASCVD and the secondary prevention of recurrent CV events. [44]


5.3 Evidence for the causal effects of
lipids and lipoproteins on the risk of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

5.3.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of

atherosclerosis

Plasma LDL-C is a measure of the cholesterol mass carried by LDL
particles, by far the most numerous of the ApoB-containing lipoproteins, and is an estimate of the concentration of circulating LDL.
Numerous epidemiological studies, Mendelian randomization studies,
and RCTs have consistently demonstrated a log-linear relationship

ESC/EAS Guidelines 129


Mendelian randomization studies also suggest that the association
between plasma TGs and the risk of CHD may be causal; however,
this evidence must be interpreted with caution because nearly all var
iants associated with TGs are also associated with HDL-C, LDL-C, or
Lp(a). [56][�][59] A recent Mendelian randomization study demonstrated
that TG-lowering lipoprotein lipase (LPL) variants and LDL-C-lowering LDL receptor variants had the same effect on the risk of ASCVD
per unit change of ApoB, suggesting that all ApoB-containing lipoproteins have the same effect on the risk of CHD. [53] Together, these
studies strongly suggest that the causal effect of TG-rich lipoproteins
and their remnants on the risk of ASCVD is determined by the circulating concentration of ApoB-containing particles, rather than by the

TG content itself.

5.3.3 High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of

atherosclerosis

The inverse association between plasma HDL-C and the risk of
ASCVD is among the most consistent and reproducible associations in observational epidemiology. [45][,][60] In contrast, Mendelian
randomization studies do not provide compelling evidence that
HDL-C is causally associated with the risk of ASCVD. [49][,][61][,][62]

However, this evidence must be interpreted with caution because
most genetic variants associated with HDL-C are also associated
with directionally opposite changes in TGs, LDL-C, or both, thus
making estimates of the effect of HDL-C on the risk of ASCVD
very difficult using the Mendelian randomization study design.

Furthermore, there is no evidence from randomized trials that

therapeutically increasing plasma HDL-C reduces the risk of CV
events. [63][�][67] In the Effects of Dalcetrapib in Patients with a Recent
Acute Coronary Syndrome (dal-OUTCOMES) trial, treatment
with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor dalcetrapib increased HDL-C without any effect on LDL-C or ApoB,
but did not reduce the risk of major CV events. [65] Similarly, in the
Assessment of Clinical Effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer
Protein Inhibition with Evacetrapib in Patients at a High-Risk for
Vascular Outcomes (ACCELERATE) and Randomized Evaluation
of the Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid Modification
(REVEAL) trials, treatment with CETP inhibitors more than
doubled HDL-C levels, but did not appear to reduce the risk of
ASCVD events beyond that expected from the modest reductions
in ApoB levels. [2][,][63][,][64] Furthermore, several randomized trials have
shown that directly infused HDL mimetics increase plasma HDLC concentrations, but do not reduce the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by intravascular ultrasound. [68][,][69]

Therefore, there is currently no randomized trial or genetic evidence to suggest that raising plasma HDL-C is likely to reduce the
risk of ASCVD events. Whether therapies that alter the function of
HDL particles will reduce the risk of ASCVD is unknown.

5.3.4 Lipoprotein(a) and risk of atherosclerosis
Lp(a) is an LDL particle with an Apo(a) moiety covalently bound to
its ApoB component. [70] It is <70 nm in diameter and can freely flux
across the endothelial barrier, where it can become—similarly to
LDL—retained within the arterial wall and thus may increase the risk
of ASCVD. Pro-atherogenic effects of Lp(a) have also been attrib
. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


plasminogen, and it has pro-inflammatory effects most likely related
to the oxidized phospholipid load carried by Lp(a). [71]

Higher plasma Lp(a) concentrations are associated with an
increased risk of ASCVD, but it appears to be a much weaker risk factor for most people than LDL-C. [72][,][73] In contrast, Mendelian randomization studies have consistently demonstrated that lifelong exposure
to higher Lp(a) levels is strongly and causally associated with an
increased risk of ASCVD. [74][,][75] While randomized trials evaluating

�
therapies that lower Lp(a) by 20 30% (including niacin and CETP
inhibitors) have not provided evidence that lowering Lp(a) reduces
the risk of ASCVD beyond that which would be expected from the
observed reduction in ApoB-containing lipoproteins, recent data
with PCSK9 inhibitors have suggested a possible role for Lp(a) lowering in reducing CV risk. [76]

This conflicting evidence appears to have been reconciled by a
recent Mendelian randomization study that showed that the
causal effect of Lp(a) on the risk of ASCVD is proportional to the
absolute change in plasma Lp(a) levels. Importantly, this study also
suggested that people with extremely high Lp(a) levels >180 mg/
dL (>430 nmol/L) may have an increased lifetime risk of ASCVD
similar to that of people with heterozygous FH (HeFH). Because
about 90% of a person’s Lp(a) level is inherited, extremely elevated Lp(a) may represent a new inherited lipid disorder that is
associated with extremely high lifetime risk of ASCVD and is twofold more prevalent than HeFH. [77] However, this study [77] and
another based on the Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of
HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events (HPS2-THRIVE)
trial [78] have shown that large absolute changes in Lp(a) may be
needed to produce a clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of

ASCVD events.

5.4 Laboratory measurement of lipids
and lipoproteins
Measurement of lipids and lipoproteins is used to estimate the risk of
ASCVD and guide therapeutic decision-making. Quantification of
plasma lipids can be performed on whole plasma and quantification
of lipoproteins can be achieved by measuring their protein component. Operationally, lipoproteins are classified based on their
hydrated density (see Table 6).

5.4.1 Lipoprotein measurement
Given the central causal role of ApoB-containing lipoproteins in the
initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, direct measurement of
the circulating concentration of atherogenic ApoB-containing lipoproteins to both estimate risk and guide treatment decisions would
be ideal. Because all ApoB-containing lipoproteins—including VLDL,
TG-rich remnant particles, and LDL—contain a single ApoB molecule, quantitation of ApoB directly estimates the number of atherogenic particles in plasma.
Standardized, automated, accurate, and inexpensive methods to
measure ApoB are available. Fasting is not required because even in
the post-prandial state, ApoB48-containing chylomicrons typically
represent <1% of the total concentration of circulating ApoB-containing lipoproteins. Furthermore, the analytical performances of
ApoB measurement methods are superior to the measurement or
calculation of LDL-C and non-HDL-C. [79]


5.3.3 High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of

atherosclerosis

The inverse association between plasma HDL-C and the risk of
ASCVD is among the most consistent and reproducible associations in observational epidemiology. [45][,][60] In contrast, Mendelian
randomization studies do not provide compelling evidence that
HDL-C is causally associated with the risk of ASCVD. [49][,][61][,][62]

However, this evidence must be interpreted with caution because
most genetic variants associated with HDL-C are also associated
with directionally opposite changes in TGs, LDL-C, or both, thus
making estimates of the effect of HDL-C on the risk of ASCVD
very difficult using the Mendelian randomization study design.

Furthermore, there is no evidence from randomized trials that

therapeutically increasing plasma HDL-C reduces the risk of CV
events. [63][�][67] In the Effects of Dalcetrapib in Patients with a Recent
Acute Coronary Syndrome (dal-OUTCOMES) trial, treatment
with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor dalcetrapib increased HDL-C without any effect on LDL-C or ApoB,
but did not reduce the risk of major CV events. [65] Similarly, in the
Assessment of Clinical Effects of Cholesteryl Ester Transfer
Protein Inhibition with Evacetrapib in Patients at a High-Risk for
Vascular Outcomes (ACCELERATE) and Randomized Evaluation
of the Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid Modification
(REVEAL) trials, treatment with CETP inhibitors more than
doubled HDL-C levels, but did not appear to reduce the risk of
ASCVD events beyond that expected from the modest reductions
in ApoB levels. [2][,][63][,][64] Furthermore, several randomized trials have
shown that directly infused HDL mimetics increase plasma HDLC concentrations, but do not reduce the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by intravascular ultrasound. [68][,][69]

Therefore, there is currently no randomized trial or genetic evidence to suggest that raising plasma HDL-C is likely to reduce the
risk of ASCVD events. Whether therapies that alter the function of
HDL particles will reduce the risk of ASCVD is unknown.


5.3.4 Lipoprotein(a) and risk of atherosclerosis
Lp(a) is an LDL particle with an Apo(a) moiety covalently bound to
its ApoB component. [70] It is <70 nm in diameter and can freely flux
across the endothelial barrier, where it can become—similarly to
LDL—retained within the arterial wall and thus may increase the risk
of ASCVD. Pro-atherogenic effects of Lp(a) have also been attributed to pro-coagulant effects as Lp(a) has a similar structure to

130 ESC/EAS Guidelines


5.4.2 Lipid measurements
In clinical practice, the concentration of plasma lipoproteins is not
usually measured directly but is instead estimated by measuring their
cholesterol content. TC in humans is distributed primarily among
three major lipoprotein classes: VLDL, LDL, and HDL. Smaller
amounts of cholesterol are also contained in two minor lipoprotein
classes: IDL and Lp(a). A standard serum lipid profile measures the

concentration of TC and HDL-C, as well as TG. With these values,

the LDL-C concentration can be estimated.

Plasma LDL-C can be measured directly using enzymatic techniques or preparative ultracentrifugation, but in clinical medicine it is
most often calculated using the Friedewald formula:

LDL-C ¼ TC � HDL-C � (TG/2.2) in mmol/L

or

LDL-C ¼ TC � HDL-C � (TG/5) in mg/dL

Although convenient, the Friedewald calculated value of LDL-C
has several well-established limitations: (i) methodological errors
may accumulate since the formula necessitates three separate analyses of TC, TGs, and HDL-C; and (ii) a constant cholesterol/TG ratio
in VLDL is assumed. With high TG values (>4.5 mmol/L or >400 mg/
dL) the formula cannot be used. This should especially be considered
in non-fasting samples.
To overcome the problems associated with calculated LDL-C,
direct enzymatic methods for the measurement of LDL-C have
been developed. These methods are commercially available as
ready to use tools for automatic analysis. The definition of LDL-C
by the Friedewald equation and by direct measurement is the
same: non-HDL-C � VLDL-C, representing the sum of the cholesterol carried by the biochemically defined LDL, IDL, and Lp(a)

subfractions.

For the general population, calculated LDL-C and direct LDL-C
show very strong correlations. [80][�][83] However, calculated LDL-C has

been found to underestimate LDL-C at concentrations of TG >_2
mmol/L (177 mg/dL). [81][,][82] Equally, at very low levels of LDL-C, calculated LDL-C may be misleading, especially in the presence of high
TG. [81][,][84][�][86] To avoid some of the problems with the Friedewald for
mula, a number of modifications for the calculation of LDL-C have

been suggested, but it remains to be proved whether these modifications are superior to Friedewald’s formula for the estimation of CV
risk. [81][,][85][�][87] It is important to note that direct LDL-C measurements
also have limitations, including systematic bias and inaccuracy in
patients with dyslipidaemia, especially for high TG levels. [88][�][90]

As an alternative calculated LDL-C, non-HDL-C can be calculated

as TC � HDL-C and is a measure of the TC carried by all atherogenic
ApoB-containing lipoproteins, including TG-rich particles in VLDL
and their remnants. [100]

Several methods for the determination of Lp(a) are available. The
complex molecular structure of Lp(a) and the variation in size of
Apo(a) has been a challenge in the development of analytical methods for Lp(a). Available methods are, to a varying degree, influenced
by the Apo(a) isoform. [91] Furthermore, the concentration of Lp(a) is
reported as either a molar concentration (nmol/L) or as a mass (mg/
dL) by the various assays, and conversion between molar and mass

concentrations has been found to be both size- and concentration
[91][�][93] . [...........................................................................................................................................................................]


needed to establish a reliable and reproducible method for the quantification of Lp(a) mass or particle number. [92]

5.4.3 Fasting or non-fasting?
Traditionally, blood sampling for lipid analyses has been recommended in the fasting state. Recent systematic studies comparing fasting and non-fasting samples have suggested that the difference is
small for most lipid parameters. [85][,][94][�][100] Non-fasting sampling
has been used in large population-based studies. [100] In most studies,
non-fasting samples display a higher TG level of �0.3 mmol/L (27 mg/
dL). [100][,][101] On average, and for most individuals, this increment will be
of no clinical significance. Indeed, a number of guidelines recommend
non-fasting sampling. [100][,][102][,][103]

For general risk screening, non-fasting samples seem to have at
least the same prognostic value as fasting samples. [104] The practical
advantages of non-fasting samples, including better patient acceptability, outweigh the potential imprecision in some patients, although the
determination of some key analytes, such as fasting glucose, may be
compromised. Furthermore, even if non-fasting sampling can be used
in most cases, in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), DM, or
hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG), calculated LDL-C should be interpreted with caution.

5.5 Recommendations for measuring
lipids and lipoproteins to estimate risk of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

Measurement of plasma TC is needed to calculate risk using SCORE,
while the inclusion of plasma HDL-C level can improve risk estimation using the online SCORE calculator. Therefore, both TC and
HDL-C should be measured to estimate a person’s risk of ASCVD
using SCORE, or one of the other risk calculators (almost all of which
also include measurements of TC and HDL-C).

Plasma LDL-C should be measured to estimate the risk of ASCVD

that can be modified with LDL-C-lowering therapies, and to identify
whether markedly elevated LDL-C levels are present that may suggest a lifetime high-risk of ASCVD due to lifelong cumulative exposure to high levels of atherogenic lipoproteins, such as in FH. Plasma
LDL-C can be either calculated or measured directly.
Plasma TG should be assessed to identify people who may have a
greater modifiable risk of ASCVD than is reflected by LDL-C, due to
the presence of an increased concentration of atherogenic ApoBcontaining TG-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, and to identify
people in whom calculated and directly measured LDL-C may underestimate the risk of ASCVD by underestimating either the concentration of circulating LDL particles or the cholesterol content carried by
those particles, such as those with very low levels of LDL. This may
be especially relevant in patients with DM or MetS.
In general, LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and ApoB concentrations are very
highly correlated. As a result, under most circumstances, they provide very similar information about ASCVD risk. [45][,][105][�][108] However,
under certain circumstances—including among people with elevated
TG levels, DM, obesity, or very low achieved LDL-C levels—the calculated or directly measured LDL-C level may underestimate both
the total concentration of cholesterol carried by LDL and, more
importantly, underestimate the total concentration of ApoB-containing lipoproteins, thus underestimating the risk of ASCVD. In around


LDL-C ¼ TC � HDL-C � (TG/2.2) in mmol/L

or

LDL-C ¼ TC � HDL-C � (TG/5) in mg/dL


Although convenient, the Friedewald calculated value of LDL-C
has several well-established limitations: (i) methodological errors
may accumulate since the formula necessitates three separate analyses of TC, TGs, and HDL-C; and (ii) a constant cholesterol/TG ratio
in VLDL is assumed. With high TG values (>4.5 mmol/L or >400 mg/
dL) the formula cannot be used. This should especially be considered
in non-fasting samples.
To overcome the problems associated with calculated LDL-C,
direct enzymatic methods for the measurement of LDL-C have

been suggested, but it remains to be proved whether these modifications are superior to Friedewald’s formula for the estimation of CV

also have limitations, including systematic bias and inaccuracy in
patients with dyslipidaemia, especially for high TG levels. [88][�][90]

As an alternative calculated LDL-C, non-HDL-C can be calculated

as TC � HDL-C and is a measure of the TC carried by all atherogenic
ApoB-containing lipoproteins, including TG-rich particles in VLDL
and their remnants. [100]

Several methods for the determination of Lp(a) are available. The
complex molecular structure of Lp(a) and the variation in size of
Apo(a) has been a challenge in the development of analytical methods for Lp(a). Available methods are, to a varying degree, influenced
by the Apo(a) isoform. [91] Furthermore, the concentration of Lp(a) is
reported as either a molar concentration (nmol/L) or as a mass (mg/
dL) by the various assays, and conversion between molar and mass

concentrations has been found to be both size- and concentrationdependent. [91][�][93] Therefore, standardization between assays is

ESC/EAS Guidelines 131


20% of patients there may be discordance between measured LDL-C
and ApoB levels. [85][,][109]

Considering the potential inaccuracy of LDL-C in dyslipidaemia,
among patients with DM or high TG levels, and in patients with very
low LDL-C levels, measurement of both ApoB and non-HDL-C is
recommended as part of routine lipid analysis for risk evaluation in
patients with elevated plasma TGs. Because ApoB provides an accurate estimate of the total concentration of atherogenic particles
under all circumstances, it is the preferred measurement to further
refine the estimate of ASCVD risk that is modifiable by lipid-lowering
therapy.
Lp(a) has a similar structure to plasminogen and binds to the plasminogen receptor, leading to increased thrombosis (pro-thrombotic
factor). Measurement of Lp(a) should be considered at least once in
each person’s lifetime, if available, to identify people who have inherited an extremely elevated level of Lp(a) >_180 mg/dL (>_430 nmol/L)
and therefore have a very high lifetime risk of ASCVD that is approximately equivalent to the risk associated with HeFH. In addition, this
strategy can identify people with less-extreme Lp(a) elevations who
may be at a higher risk of ASCVD, which is not reflected by the
SCORE system, or by other lipid or lipoprotein measurements.
Measurement of Lp(a) has been shown to provide clinically significant
improved risk reclassification under certain conditions, and therefore
should be considered in patients who have an estimated 10-year risk
of ASCVD that is close to the threshold between high and moderate
risk. [110][�][112]

Recommendations for measuring lipids and lipoproteins to estimate the risk of ASCVD are summarized below. . [....................................................................................]

### 6 Treatment targets and goals

In previous EAS/ESC Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias [1][,][113] and other major guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic CV risk in adults, [40][,][114] the

importance of LDL-C lowering to prevent ASCVD is strongly
emphasized. The European Task Force felt that limiting the current
knowledge on CV prevention only to results from RCTs reduces the
exploitation of the potential that is available for the prevention of
ASCVD. It is the concordance of the conclusions from many different
approaches (from basic science, clinical observations, genetics, epidemiology, RCTs, etc.) that contributes to the understanding of the
causes of ASCVD and to the potential of prevention. The Task Force

is aware of the limitations of some of the sources of evidence and

accepts that RCTs have not examined different LDL-C goals systematically, but felt that it was appropriate to look at the totality of the
evidence. Particular consideration was given to results from metaanalyses confirming the dose-dependent reduction in ASCVD with
LDL-C-lowering agents; the greater the absolute LDL-C reduction,
the greater the CV risk reduction. [35][,][36][,][50][,][115] The benefits related to
LDL-C reduction are not specific for statin therapy. [33] No level of

LDL-C below which benefit ceases or harm occurs has been defined.

There is considerable individual variability in the LDL-C response
to dietary and drug treatments, [31] which is traditionally taken to support a tailored approach to management. Total CV risk reduction
should be individualized, and this can be more specific if goals are
defined. The use of goals can also aid patient�doctor communication. It is judged that a goal approach may facilitate adherence to

treatment, although this consensus opinion has not been fully tested.
For all these reasons, the European Task Force retains a goal
approach to lipid management and treatment goals are tailored to
the total CV risk level. There is also evidence suggesting that lowering
of LDL-C beyond the goals that were set in the previous EAS/ESC
Guidelines is associated with fewer ASCVD events. [34][,][116][,][117]

Therefore, it seems appropriate to reduce LDL-C to as low a level as
possible, at least in patients at very high CV risk, and for this reason a
minimum 50% reduction is suggested for LDL reduction, together
with reaching the tailored goal.

The lipid goals are part of a comprehensive CV risk reduction
strategy and are summarized in Table 7. The rationales for the nonlipid targets are given in the 2016 ESC Joint Prevention Guidelines. [10]

The targeted approach to lipid management is primarily aimed at
reducing atherosclerotic risk by substantially lowering LDL-C to levels that have been achieved in recent large-scale trials of PCSK-9
inhibitors. Therefore, for patients at very high CV risk, whether in
secondary prevention or (rarely) in primary prevention, LDL-C
reduction of >_50% from baseline and an LDL-C goal of <1.4 mmol/L
(<55 mg/dL) are recommended. For patients with ASCVD who
experience a second vascular event within 2 years (not necessarily of
the same type as the first event) while taking maximally tolerated
statin-based therapy, an LDL-C goal <1.0 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL) may
be considered. [119][,][120] For people at high CV risk, an LDL-C reduction
of >_50% from baseline and an LDL-C goal <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL)
are recommended. In patients at moderate CV risk, an LDL-C goal
<2.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) should be considered, while for low-risk
individuals a goal of <3.0 mmol/L (<116 mg/dL) may be considered
(see Recommendations for treatment goals for low-density lipoprotein cho[lesterol below and Supplementary Table 2).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455#supplementary-data) . [...........................................................................................]


Secondary goals have also been defined by inference for nonHDL-C and for ApoB; they receive a moderate grading, as they have
not been extensively studied in RCTs. The specific goal for nonHDL-C should be 0.8 mmol/L (30 mg/dL) higher than the corresponding LDL-C goal; the adjustment of lipid-lowering therapy in
accordance with these secondary goals may be considered in patients
at very high CV risk after achievement of an LDL-C goal, although the
clinical advantages of this approach with respect to outcomes remain
to be addressed. When secondary targets are used the recommendations are: (i) non-HDL-C <2.2 mmol/L (<85 mg/dL), <2.6 mmol/L
(<100 mg/dL), and <3.4 mmol/L (<130 mg/dL) in people at very high,
high, and moderate CV risk, respectively; [121][�][123] and (ii) ApoB <65
mg/dL, <80 mg/dL, and <100 mg/dL in very-high, high, and moderate
total CV risk, respectively. [121][,][123][,][124]

To date, no specific goals for HDL-C or TG levels have been
determined in clinical trials, although increases in HDL-C predict
atherosclerosis regression, and low HDL-C is associated with excess
events and mortality in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients, even
at low LDL levels. Clinicians should use clinical judgment when considering further treatment intensification in patients at high or very
high total CV risk.
### 7 Lifestyle modifications to improve the plasma lipid profile

The pivotal role of nutrition in the prevention of ASCVD has been
extensively reviewed. [125][�][129] Dietary factors influence the development of CVD either directly or through their action on traditional
risk factors, such as plasma lipids, BP, or glucose levels.

Convincing evidence of the causal association between diet and
ASCVD risk is, nevertheless, available indirectly from randomized
‘metabolic ward’ studies showing that high saturated fat intake causes
increased LDL-C concentrations, and from cohort studies, genetic
epidemiological studies, and randomized trials showing that higher

LDL-C levels cause ASCVD.

The lack of concordance between studies is due both to methodo
logical problems (particularly inadequate sample sizes or short study
durations) and the difficulties of evaluating the impact of a single dietary factor independently of any other changes in the diet. [130] In fact, as
foods are mixtures of different nutrients and other components, it is
not appropriate to attribute the health effects of a food to only one
of its components. Moreover, if energy intake must be kept constant,
eating less of one macronutrient implies necessarily eating more of
others. The quality of the replacement (for instance, unsaturated fat
vs. highly refined grains) can influence the effect observed, significantly
modifying the impact on health of the nutrient replaced. These limitations suggest caution in interpreting the results of RCTs or even
meta-analyses of RCTs in relation to the effect of a single dietary
change on ASCVD. [130]

To overcome, at least in part, these problems, in recent years
nutrition research has focused on the relationship between
ASCVD on the one hand, and foods and dietary patterns—rather
than single nutrients—on the other. Consistent evidence from
epidemiological studies indicates that higher consumption of fruit,
non-starchy vegetables, nuts, legumes, fish, vegetable oils, yoghurt,
and wholegrains, along with a lower intake of red and processed

. [..................................................................................]


meats, foods higher in refined carbohydrates, and salt, is associated with a lower incidence of CV events. [131] Moreover, it indi
cates that the replacement of animal fats, including dairy fat, with
vegetable sources of fats and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
may decrease the risk of CVD. [132]

Dietary patterns that have been more extensively evaluated are
the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet—particularly in relation to BP control—and the Mediterranean diet; both
have proved to be effective in reducing CV risk factors and, possibly,
to contribute to ASCVD prevention. [133] The most relevant difference
between the Mediterranean and the DASH diet is the emphasis of
the former on extra-virgin olive oil. The Mediterranean diet is associ
ated with a reduced incidence of CV and other non-communicable
diseases in epidemiological studies, [134][,][135] and has been proved in
RCTs to be effective in reducing CV events in primary and secondary
prevention. [136] In particular, the Prevencion con Dieta Mediterr� �anea
(PREDIMED) trial indicated that participants allocated to a
Mediterranean-type diet, supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil or
nuts, had a significantly lower (around 30%) incidence of major CV
events compared with those who were on a low-fat diet. [137]

In summary, despite the results of PREDIMED and a few other
intervention studies with ASCVD endpoints that support a healthy
lifestyle for ASCVD prevention, RCTs cannot represent the sole
grounds on which dietary recommendations should rely. They also
need to be based on the combination of large observational cohort
studies and relatively short-term randomized trials having intermediate risk factors (such as blood lipids) as outcomes.

Table 8 summarizes the currently available evidence on the influences of lifestyle changes and functional foods on lipoproteins, indicating the magnitudes of the effects and the levels of evidence in relation
to the impacts on the specific lipoprotein class; for the reasons out
lined above, the levels of evidence are not based on RCTs with

ASCVD endpoints. Moreover, within the Guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemias, information on the potential to improve
plasma lipoprotein profiles by dietary means is clinically relevant,

even in the absence of a clear demonstration of CV benefits.

7.1 Influence of lifestyle on total
cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels

Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are the dietary factor with the greatest
impact on LDL-C levels (0.02�0.04 mmol/L or 0.8�1.6 mg/dL of
LDL-C increase for every additional 1% energy coming from saturated fat). [164] Quantitatively, dietary trans fatty acids have a similar elevating effect on LDL-C to that of SFAs; however, while SFAs increase
HDL-C levels, trans fats decrease them. [137] Trans unsaturated fatty
acids can be found in limited amounts (usually <5% of total fat) in
dairy products and in meats from ruminants. ‘Partially hydrogenated
fatty acids’ of industrial origin represent the major source of trans
fatty acids in the diet; the average consumption of trans fatty acids . [......................................................................]


�
ranges from 0.2 6.5% of the total energy intake in different populations. [165] Unsaturated fat-rich oils from safflower, sunflower,

rapeseed, flaxseed, corn, olives, or soybean were shown to reduce
LDL-C levels (-0.42 to -0.20 mmol/L) when used in substitution of
SFA-rich foods like butter or lard. [166] The effects of carbohydrate
consumption on LDL-C are described in section 7.4.3.

Body weight reduction also influences TC and LDL-C levels, but
the magnitude of the effect is small: in obese people, a decrease in
LDL-C concentration of 0.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) is observed for every
10 kg of weight loss. [147][,][167] The reduction of LDL-C levels induced by
regular physical exercise is even smaller. [151][,][168] The benefits of weight
reduction and physical exercise on the CV risk profile likely impact
on other risk factors, especially hypertension and diabetes.

Table 9 summarizes the possible choices of foods to lower TC and
LDL-C levels. Given the cultural diversity of the European populations, they should be translated into practical behaviours, considering

local habits and socio-economic factors.

7.2 Influence of lifestyle on triglyceride
levels

Weight reduction improves insulin sensitivity and decreases TG levels. Regular physical exercise reduces plasma TG levels over and
above the effect of weight reduction. [151][,][168][,][169] Alcohol intake has a

major impact on TG levels, particularly in individuals with HTG. [153][,][170]

The detrimental effects of a high-carbohydrate diet on TGs occur
mainly when refined carbohydrate-rich foods are consumed, while
they are much less prominent if the diet is based largely on fibre-rich,
low-glycaemic index foods. This applies particularly to people with
DM or MetS. [171][,][172]

Habitual consumption of significant amounts (>10% energy) of
dietary fructose contributes to TG elevation, particularly in people
with HTG or abdominal obesity. These effects are dose-dependent;
with a habitual fructose consumption between 15�20% of total

�
energy intake, plasma TG increases by as much as 30 40%. Sucrose,
a disaccharide containing glucose and fructose, represents an important source of fructose in the diet. [159][,][173][,][174]

may increase HDL-C levels by 0.08 0.15 mmol/L (3.1 6 mg/dL). [169]

Smoking cessation may also contribute to HDL-C elevation, provided
that weight gain is prevented. [163]

particularly to people at increased CV risk, may also be able to modify plasma TG and HDL-C levels (Table 9). This section focuses on
dietary and other lifestyle factors that may be implemented to
improve the overall lipoprotein profile.

7.4.1 Body weight and physical activity
Since overweight, obesity, and—in particular—abdominal adiposity
often contribute to dyslipidaemia, caloric intake should be reduced
and energy expenditure increased in those with excessive weight
and/or abdominal adiposity.
In the case of excess weight, body weight reduction, even if modest

�
(5 10% of basal body weight), improves lipid abnormalities and
favourably affects the other CV risk factors often present in dyslipidaemic individuals. [148] While the beneficial effects of weight reduction on
metabolic and surrogate markers have been demonstrated, the benefits of weight loss on mortality and CV outcome are less clear. [175]

Weight reduction can be achieved by decreasing the consumption

�
of energy-dense foods, inducing a caloric deficit of 300 500 kcal/day.
The intervention should combine diet and exercise; this approach
also leads to the greatest improvement in physical performance and
quality of life, and mitigates reductions in muscle and bone mass, particularly in older people. [176] It is always appropriate to advise people
with dyslipidaemia to engage in regular physical exercise of moderate
intensity for >_30 min/day, even if they are not overweight. [168]

7.4.2 Dietary fat
Avoiding any consumption of trans fat is a key measure of the dietary
prevention of CVD. The trans fatty acids produced in the partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils account for 80% of total intake. Thanks to


The detrimental effects of a high-carbohydrate diet on TGs occur
mainly when refined carbohydrate-rich foods are consumed, while
they are much less prominent if the diet is based largely on fibre-rich,
low-glycaemic index foods. This applies particularly to people with
DM or MetS. [171][,][172]

Habitual consumption of significant amounts (>10% energy) of
dietary fructose contributes to TG elevation, particularly in people
with HTG or abdominal obesity. These effects are dose-dependent;
with a habitual fructose consumption between 15�20% of total

�
energy intake, plasma TG increases by as much as 30 40%. Sucrose,
a disaccharide containing glucose and fructose, represents an important source of fructose in the diet. [159][,][173][,][174]


7.3 Influence of lifestyle on high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels
Weight reduction increases HDL-C levels; a 0.01 mmol/L (0.4 mg/
dL) increase is observed for every kilogram decrease in body weight
when weight reduction has stabilized. Aerobic physical activity, such
as 25�30 km of brisk walking per week (or any equivalent activity),

� �
may increase HDL-C levels by 0.08 0.15 mmol/L (3.1 6 mg/dL). [169]

Smoking cessation may also contribute to HDL-C elevation, provided
that weight gain is prevented. [163]


7.4 Lifestyle recommendations to
improve the plasma lipid profile
LDL-C lowering represents the primary target for reducing CV risk
and therefore deserves special emphasis in the evaluation of lifestyle
measures. The diet recommended to the general population, and

136 ESC/EAS Guidelines


efforts made in different parts of the world, the intake of trans fatty

�
acids has decreased substantially over the past 10 15 years.
As for saturated fat, its consumption should be <10% of the total
caloric intake and should be further reduced (<7% of energy) in the
presence of hypercholesterolaemia. For most individuals, a wide
range of total fat intakes is acceptable, and will depend upon individual preferences and characteristics. However, fat intakes >35�40%
of calories are generally associated with increased intakes of both
saturated fat and calories. Conversely, low intakes of fats and oils
increase the risk of inadequate intakes of vitamin E and of essential
fatty acids, and may contribute to a reduction of HDL-C. [164]

Fat intake should predominantly come from sources of monounsaturated fatty acids, including both n-6 and n-3 PUFAs. Not enough
data are available to make a recommendation regarding the optimal
n-3:n-6 fatty acid ratio. [177][,][178] The cholesterol intake in the diet should
be reduced (<300 mg/day), particularly in people with high plasma

cholesterol levels.

7.4.3 Dietary carbohydrate and fibre
Dietary carbohydrate has a ‘neutral’ effect on LDL-C, although excessive consumption is represented by untoward effects on plasma TGs
and HDL-C levels. [164] Dietary fibre (particularly of the soluble
type)—which is present in legumes, fruits, vegetables, and wholegrain
cereals (e.g. oats and barley)—has a hypocholesterolaemic effect and
represents a good dietary substitute for saturated fat to maximize

the effects of the diet on LDL-C levels, and to minimize the untoward
effects of a high-carbohydrate diet on other lipoproteins. [140][,][179]

Carbohydrate intake should range between 45�55% of total
energy intake, since both higher and lower percentages of carbohydrate diets are associated with increased mortality. [180][,][181] A fat
�
modified diet that provides 25 40 g per day of total dietary fibre,

�
including >_7 13 g of soluble fibre, is well tolerated, effective, and
recommended for plasma lipid control; conversely, there is no justification for the recommendation of very low-carbohydrate diets. [182]

Intake of added sugar should not exceed 10% of total energy (in
addition to the amount present in natural foods such as fruits and dairy
products); more restrictive advice concerning sugars may be useful for
those needing to lose weight or with high plasma TG values, MetS, or
DM. Soft drinks should be used with moderation by the general population, and should be drastically limited in those individuals with elevated TG values or visceral adiposity. [158][,][159][,][174] The Prospective Urban
Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study was a large, epidemiological cohort
study of 135 335 individuals enrolled in 18 countries with food frequency questionnaires recorded. Total fat and types of fat were not
associated with CVD, MI, or CVD mortality, whereas saturated fat had
an inverse association with stroke. [181] However, a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies including the PURE study showed a U-shaped
relationship between carbohydrate intake and mortality: diets associated with the highest mortality rate had carbohydrate intakes >70%
and <40% of energy, with minimal risk observed when carbohydrate
intake was between 45�55% of total energy intake. [180]

7.4.4 Alcohol

Moderate alcohol consumption [<_10 g/day (1 unit) for men and
women] is acceptable for those who drink alcoholic beverages, if TG
levels are not elevated. [183][,][184] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


7.4.5 Smoking
Smoking cessation has clear benefits regarding overall CV risk, and
specifically on HDL-C levels. [163]

7.5 Dietary supplements and functional
foods for the treatment of dyslipidaemias
Nutritional evaluation of functional foods includes not only the
search for clinical evidence of beneficial effects relevant to improved

health or the reduction of disease risk, but also the demonstration of

good tolerability. Overall, the available evidence on functional foods
so far identified in this field is incomplete; the major gap is an absence
of diet-based intervention trials of enough duration to be relevant for
the natural history of dyslipidaemia and CVD.

7.5.1 Phytosterols
The principal phytosterols are sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol; they occur naturally in vegetable oils and in smaller amounts in
vegetables, fresh fruits, nuts, grains, and legumes. The dietary intake
of plant sterols ranges between an average of 250 mg/day in
Northern Europe to �500 mg/day in Mediterranean countries.
Phytosterols compete with cholesterol for intestinal absorption,
thereby modulating TC levels.
Daily consumption of 2 g of phytosterols can effectively lower TC

�
and LDL-C levels by 7 10% in humans (with a certain degree of heterogeneity among individuals), while it has little or no effect on HDLC and TG levels. [143] However, to date no studies have been performed on the subsequent effect on CVD. Based on LDL-C lowering
and the absence of adverse signals, functional foods with plant sterols/stanols (>_2 g/day with the main meal) may be considered: (i) in
individuals with high cholesterol levels at intermediate or low global
CV risk who do not qualify for pharmacotherapy; (ii) as an adjunct to
pharmacological therapy in high- and very-high-risk patients who fail
to achieve LDL-C goals on statins or could not be treated with statins; and (iii) in adults and children (aged >6 years) with FH, in line
with current guidance. [142]

7.5.2 Monacolin and red yeast rice
Red yeast rice (RYR) is a source of fermented pigment that has been

used in China as a food colorant and flavour enhancer for centuries.

Hypocholesterolaemic effects of RYR are related to a statin-like
mechanism—inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A
(HMG-CoA) reductase—of monacolins, which represent the bioactive ingredient. Different commercial preparations of RYR have dif
ferent concentrations of monacolins, and lower TC and LDL-C levels

to variable extents, but the consumer is not able to make that distinction. [144][,][185] Moreover, the long-term safety of the regular consumption of these products has not been fully documented and safety
issues due to the possible presence of contaminants in some prepara
tions have been raised. Side effects like those observed with statins

have also been reported.

In the only available RCT in patients with ASCVD, a partially purified extract of RYR reduced recurrent events by 45%. [146] A clinically
relevant hypocholesterolaemic effect (up to a 20% reduction) has
been observed with RYR preparations providing an o.d. [once daily
(omni die)] dose of 2.5�10 mg monacolin K. [145] Nutraceuticals containing purified RYR may be considered in people with elevated


Fat intake should predominantly come from sources of monounsaturated fatty acids, including both n-6 and n-3 PUFAs. Not enough
data are available to make a recommendation regarding the optimal
n-3:n-6 fatty acid ratio. [177][,][178] The cholesterol intake in the diet should
be reduced (<300 mg/day), particularly in people with high plasma

cholesterol levels.


7.4.3 Dietary carbohydrate and fibre
Dietary carbohydrate has a ‘neutral’ effect on LDL-C, although excessive consumption is represented by untoward effects on plasma TGs
and HDL-C levels. [164] Dietary fibre (particularly of the soluble
type)—which is present in legumes, fruits, vegetables, and wholegrain
cereals (e.g. oats and barley)—has a hypocholesterolaemic effect and
represents a good dietary substitute for saturated fat to maximize

the effects of the diet on LDL-C levels, and to minimize the untoward
effects of a high-carbohydrate diet on other lipoproteins. [140][,][179]

Carbohydrate intake should range between 45�55% of total
energy intake, since both higher and lower percentages of carbohydrate diets are associated with increased mortality. [180][,][181] A fat
�
modified diet that provides 25 40 g per day of total dietary fibre,

�
including >_7 13 g of soluble fibre, is well tolerated, effective, and
recommended for plasma lipid control; conversely, there is no justification for the recommendation of very low-carbohydrate diets. [182]

Intake of added sugar should not exceed 10% of total energy (in
addition to the amount present in natural foods such as fruits and dairy
products); more restrictive advice concerning sugars may be useful for
those needing to lose weight or with high plasma TG values, MetS, or
DM. Soft drinks should be used with moderation by the general population, and should be drastically limited in those individuals with elevated TG values or visceral adiposity. [158][,][159][,][174] The Prospective Urban
Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study was a large, epidemiological cohort
study of 135 335 individuals enrolled in 18 countries with food frequency questionnaires recorded. Total fat and types of fat were not
associated with CVD, MI, or CVD mortality, whereas saturated fat had
an inverse association with stroke. [181] However, a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies including the PURE study showed a U-shaped
relationship between carbohydrate intake and mortality: diets associated with the highest mortality rate had carbohydrate intakes >70%
and <40% of energy, with minimal risk observed when carbohydrate
intake was between 45�55% of total energy intake. [180]


7.4.4 Alcohol

Moderate alcohol consumption [<_10 g/day (1 unit) for men and
women] is acceptable for those who drink alcoholic beverages, if TG
levels are not elevated. [183][,][184]

ESC/EAS Guidelines 137


plasma cholesterol concentrations who do not qualify for treatment
with statins in view of their global CV risk. However, there is a clear
need for better regulation of RYR supplements. Information regarding the precise composition of these products, the quantities of their
components, and their purity should be implemented. [185]

7.5.3 Dietary fibre
Available evidence consistently demonstrates a TC- and LDL-Clowering effect of b-glucan, a viscous fibre from oat and barley. Foods
enriched with these fibres or supplements are well tolerated, effective, and recommended for LDL-C lowering. [186] However, the dosage
needed to achieve a clinically relevant reduction in levels of LDL-C of
3�5% varies from 3�10 g per day according to the specific type of
fibre. [187]

7.5.4 Soy
The cholesterol-lowering effect of soy is generally attributed to its
isoflavone and phytoestrogen content, which decreases progressively
with the increasing degree of soybean processing. Soy protein has
also been indicated as being able to induce a modest LDL-C-lowering
effect when replacing animal protein foods. However, this was not
confirmed when changes in other dietary components were taken
into account. [187][,][188]

7.5.5 Policosanol and berberine

Policosanol is a natural mixture of long-chain aliphatic alcohols
extracted primarily from sugarcane wax. [189] Studies show that policosanol from sugarcane, rice or wheat germ has no significant effect on
LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, ApoB, Lp(a), homocysteine, high-sensitivity Creactive protein, fibrinogen, or blood coagulation factor levels. [190]

As for berberine, a recent meta-analysis evaluated its effects
on plasma lipids in humans. [191] The comparative evaluation of berberine and lifestyle intervention or placebo indicated that in the berberine group, LDL-C and plasma TG levels were more effectively
reduced than in the control group. However, due to the lack of
high-quality randomized clinical trials, the efficacy of berberine for
treating dyslipidaemia needs to be further validated. Moreover, the
bioavailability of the different berberine preparations is a matter of
debate. [187]

7.5.6 n-3 unsaturated fatty acids
Observational evidence indicates that consumption of fish (at least
twice a week) and vegetable foods rich in n-3 fatty acids (a-linoleic
acid is present in walnuts, some vegetables, and some seed oils) is
associated with lower risk of CV death and stroke, but has no major
effects on plasma lipoprotein metabolism. [178][,][192] Pharmacological

�
doses of long-chain n-3 fatty acids (2 3 g/day) reduce TG levels by
about 30% and also reduce the post-prandial lipaemic response, but a
higher dosage may increase LDL-C levels. a-Linolenic acid is less
effective at altering TG levels. [156][,][193] Recently, a significantly lower
risk of ischaemic events, including CV death, was observed in patients
with elevated TG levels despite the use of statins treated with 2 g of
icosapent ethyl b.i.d. [twice a day]. [194]

### 8 Drugs for treatment of dyslipidaemias

8.1 Statins

8.1.1 Mechanism of action

Statins reduce the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver by competitively inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting
step in cholesterol biosynthesis. The reduction in intracellular cholesterol promotes increased LDL receptor (LDLR) expression at the
surface of the hepatocytes, which in turn results in increased uptake
of LDL from the blood, and decreased plasma concentrations of
LDL- and other ApoB-containing lipoproteins, including TG-rich
particles.

8.1.2 Effects on lipids
8.1.2.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The degree of LDL-C reduction is dose-dependent and varies between the different statins. A highintensity regimen is defined as the dose of a statin that, on average,
reduces LDL-C by >_50%; moderate-intensity therapy is defined as the

�
dose expected to reduce LDL-C by 30 50%. Notably, there is consid
erable interindividual variation in LDL-C reduction with the same dose
of drug. [31] Poor responses to statin treatment in clinical studies are to
some extent caused by poor compliance, but may also be explained by
genetic backgrounds. [195][,][196] Interindividual variations in statin responses
warrant monitoring of responses on initiation of therapy.

Among patients who cannot tolerate the recommended intensity

of a statin because of adverse effects or those who do not reach their

goal, the addition of a non-statin lipid-modifying agent to a maximally
tolerated statin is recommended. [197][,][198]

8.1.2.2 Triglycerides. Statins usually reduce TG levels by 10�20% from
baseline values. [199] More potent statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin,
and pitavastatin) demonstrate robust lowering of TG levels, especially at high doses and in patients with elevated TGs (HTG), in

whom the absolute risk, and therefore the absolute risk reduction,

is larger.

The mechanism of the TG-lowering effect has not been fully elucidated, but it seems to be partly independent of the LDLR pathway. It
may involve the upregulation of VLDL uptake by hepatocytes, as well
as a reduction of the production rate of VLDLs; these effects seem to
be dependent on pre-treatment VLDL concentrations. [200]

8.1.2.3 High-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In a meta-analysis, [201] elevations in HDL-C levels varied with dose among the respective statins;

�
such elevations ranged from 1 10%. However, given the marked
statin-mediated decrement in atherogenic ApoB-containing lipoproteins, the extent to which the very modest effect on HDL-C levels
might contribute to the overall observed reductions in CV risk consistently observed in statin intervention trials cannot reliably be
disentangled.

8.1.2.4 Lipoprotein(a). Statins only marginally affect Lp(a) plasma levels.
Previous studies have reported either no effect on or an increase of
Lp(a) levels after statin treatment. [202][,][203] The mechanisms by which
statins raise oxidized phospholipids on Lp(a) require further

investigation.


7.5.3 Dietary fibre
Available evidence consistently demonstrates a TC- and LDL-Clowering effect of b-glucan, a viscous fibre from oat and barley. Foods
enriched with these fibres or supplements are well tolerated, effective, and recommended for LDL-C lowering. [186] However, the dosage
needed to achieve a clinically relevant reduction in levels of LDL-C of
3�5% varies from 3�10 g per day according to the specific type of
fibre. [187]


7.5.4 Soy
The cholesterol-lowering effect of soy is generally attributed to its
isoflavone and phytoestrogen content, which decreases progressively
with the increasing degree of soybean processing. Soy protein has
also been indicated as being able to induce a modest LDL-C-lowering
effect when replacing animal protein foods. However, this was not
confirmed when changes in other dietary components were taken
into account. [187][,][188]


7.5.5 Policosanol and berberine

Policosanol is a natural mixture of long-chain aliphatic alcohols
extracted primarily from sugarcane wax. [189] Studies show that policosanol from sugarcane, rice or wheat germ has no significant effect on
LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, ApoB, Lp(a), homocysteine, high-sensitivity Creactive protein, fibrinogen, or blood coagulation factor levels. [190]

As for berberine, a recent meta-analysis evaluated its effects
on plasma lipids in humans. [191] The comparative evaluation of berberine and lifestyle intervention or placebo indicated that in the berberine group, LDL-C and plasma TG levels were more effectively
reduced than in the control group. However, due to the lack of
high-quality randomized clinical trials, the efficacy of berberine for
treating dyslipidaemia needs to be further validated. Moreover, the
bioavailability of the different berberine preparations is a matter of
debate. [187]


7.5.6 n-3 unsaturated fatty acids
Observational evidence indicates that consumption of fish (at least
twice a week) and vegetable foods rich in n-3 fatty acids (a-linoleic
acid is present in walnuts, some vegetables, and some seed oils) is
associated with lower risk of CV death and stroke, but has no major
effects on plasma lipoprotein metabolism. [178][,][192] Pharmacological

�
doses of long-chain n-3 fatty acids (2 3 g/day) reduce TG levels by
about 30% and also reduce the post-prandial lipaemic response, but a
higher dosage may increase LDL-C levels. a-Linolenic acid is less
effective at altering TG levels. [156][,][193] Recently, a significantly lower
risk of ischaemic events, including CV death, was observed in patients
with elevated TG levels despite the use of statins treated with 2 g of
icosapent ethyl b.i.d. [twice a day]. [194]

8.1.3 Other effects of statins

Although reduction of LDL-C levels is the major effect of statins, a
number of other, potentially important effects have been suggested
(pleiotropic effects of statins). [204][,][205] Among such effects that are
potentially relevant for the prevention of CVD are the antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects of statin treatment. These
effects have been shown in vitro and in experimental systems, but
their clinical relevance remains unproven. [18][,][206]

8.1.3.1 Effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A large number
of meta-analyses have been performed to analyse the effects of
statins in populations and in subgroups. [34][�][36][,][38][,][51][,][207][�][214] In the
Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) meta-analysis of individual
participant data (IPD) from >170 000 participants in 26 RCTs of a
statin vs. control or a more vs. less intensive statin regimen, [34] for

each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, statin/more statin reduced

major vascular events (MI, CAD death, or any stroke or coronary
revascularization) by �22%, major coronary events by 23%, CAD
death by 20%, total stroke by 17%, and total mortality by 10% over
5 years. The proportional effects (per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C)
on major vascular events were similar in all subgroups examined, so
the absolute risk reduction was proportional to the absolute baseline risk. The relative benefits were half as large in the first year as
compared with subsequent years. There was no increased risk for
any non-CV cause of death, including cancer, in those allocated statins. The absolute benefit from statin treatment was lower in people
in primary prevention, who are typically at lower risk. [36][,][38][,][214][,][215] In
the CTT meta-analysis of treatment in people with a low-risk of vascular disease, [36] the relative risk reduction of major vascular events
per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C was at least as large in low-risk individuals (i.e. in primary prevention). In those without a history of vascular disease, statin therapy reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by
9% per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. Similar results were
reported in a Cochrane review in 2013. [213] The West of Scotland
Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) data were recently reanalysed, and demonstrated that even people without DM and a 10 year
predicted ASCVD risk of <7.5% benefit from statin treatment. There
was also a legacy effect with a mortality benefit of 18% in all-cause
death over 20 years. [216] Statins are effective for the prevention of
ASCVD in the elderly, including those aged >75 years. [217] Statins are
not effective in a few specific groups, notably those with heart failure
(HF) or patients receiving haemodialysis. [214][,][218][�][222]

Current available evidence from meta-analyses suggests that the
clinical benefit of statin treatment is largely a class effect, driven by
the absolute LDL-C reduction; therefore, the type of statin used
should reflect the treatment goals for a given patient.
The following scheme may be proposed.

 - [Evaluate the total CV risk of the individual.]

 - [Determine the treatment goals (depending on current risk).]

 - [Involve the patient in decisions on CV risk management.]

 - [Choose a statin regimen and, where necessary, additional treat-]
ments (e.g. ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors) that can meet the
treatment goals (per cent and absolute value).

 - [Response to statin treatment is variable, therefore uptitration of]
the statin dose may be required before additional LDL-lowering
treatments are started. . [........................................................................................................................................................................]


These are general criteria for the choice of drug. Factors such as
the clinical condition of the patient, concomitant medications, drug
tolerability, local treatment tradition, and drug cost will play major
roles in determining the final choice of drug and dose.

Furthermore, the effects of statins on a number of other clinical

conditions have been evaluated. For cancer, a meta-analysis of IPD
from randomized trials has shown that statins do not have any significant effect on cancer, at least over a period of �5 years. [223] Other
conditions, such as dementia, [224] hepatic steatosis, [225] venous thromboembolism, [226] atrial fibrillation, [227][,][228] and polycystic ovary syndrome [229] have also been studied, and no effect of statins on these

conditions has been reliably demonstrated.

The suggested effect on Alzheimer’s disease was recently reviewed
in a Cochrane analysis reporting no conclusive effect from statins. [230]

Furthermore, neurocognitive functions were extensively investigated
in the Evaluating PCSK9 Binding Antibody Influence on Cognitive
Health in High Cardiovascular Risk Subjects (EBBINGHAUS)
study [231] and no excess risk was observed among patients on a statin
regimen randomized to a PCSK9 mAb.

8.1.4 Adverse effects and interactions of statins

Statins differ in their absorption, bioavailability, plasma protein
binding, excretion, and lipophilicity. Evening administration is usually recommended. Lovastatin and simvastatin are prodrugs,

whereas the other available statins are administered in their active

form. Their bioavailability is relatively low, owing to a first-pass
effect in the liver, and many statins undergo significant hepatic
metabolism via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes, except pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin. These enzymes are
expressed mainly in the liver and gut wall. Although statins are
generally very well tolerated, they do have some specific adverse
effects on muscle, glucose haemostasis, and haemorrhagic stroke.
However, there is also widespread misinformation about potential adverse effects, as reviewed recently. [232][,][233]

8.1.4.1 Adverse effects on muscle. Myopathy is the most clinically relevant adverse effect of statins. Among the risk factors for myopathy, it
is particularly important that interaction with concomitant drug therapy is considered (see below). Rhabdomyolysis is the most severe
form of statin-induced muscle damage, characterized by severe muscular pain, muscle necrosis, and myoglobinuria potentially leading to
renal failure and death. In rhabdomyolysis, creatine kinase (CK) levels
are elevated by >_10 times, and often >_40 times, the upper limit of
normal (ULN). [234] The frequency of rhabdomyolysis has been estimated to represent 1�3 cases/100 000 patient-years. [235] Patients taking statin therapy frequently report muscle symptoms [so-called
‘statin-associated muscle symptoms’ (SAMS)], and in non
randomized, observational studies, statins are associated with muscu
lar pain and tenderness (myalgia) without CK elevation or major
functional loss, with the reported frequency of SAMS in such studies

�
varying between 10 15% among statin-treated individuals. [236][�][238]

However, in part because individuals in observational studies are not
blind to the treatment they are receiving, such studies are unreliable
when used to assess the adverse effects of statins. [233] In contrast, in

blinded randomized trials of statins vs. placebo there is no, or only a


8.1.3.1 Effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A large number
of meta-analyses have been performed to analyse the effects of
statins in populations and in subgroups. [34][�][36][,][38][,][51][,][207][�][214] In the
Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) meta-analysis of individual
participant data (IPD) from >170 000 participants in 26 RCTs of a
statin vs. control or a more vs. less intensive statin regimen, [34] for

each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, statin/more statin reduced

major vascular events (MI, CAD death, or any stroke or coronary
revascularization) by �22%, major coronary events by 23%, CAD
death by 20%, total stroke by 17%, and total mortality by 10% over
5 years. The proportional effects (per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C)
on major vascular events were similar in all subgroups examined, so
the absolute risk reduction was proportional to the absolute baseline risk. The relative benefits were half as large in the first year as
compared with subsequent years. There was no increased risk for
any non-CV cause of death, including cancer, in those allocated statins. The absolute benefit from statin treatment was lower in people
in primary prevention, who are typically at lower risk. [36][,][38][,][214][,][215] In
the CTT meta-analysis of treatment in people with a low-risk of vascular disease, [36] the relative risk reduction of major vascular events
per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C was at least as large in low-risk individuals (i.e. in primary prevention). In those without a history of vascular disease, statin therapy reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by
9% per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. Similar results were
reported in a Cochrane review in 2013. [213] The West of Scotland
Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) data were recently reanalysed, and demonstrated that even people without DM and a 10 year
predicted ASCVD risk of <7.5% benefit from statin treatment. There
was also a legacy effect with a mortality benefit of 18% in all-cause
death over 20 years. [216] Statins are effective for the prevention of
ASCVD in the elderly, including those aged >75 years. [217] Statins are
not effective in a few specific groups, notably those with heart failure
(HF) or patients receiving haemodialysis. [214][,][218][�][222]

Current available evidence from meta-analyses suggests that the
clinical benefit of statin treatment is largely a class effect, driven by
the absolute LDL-C reduction; therefore, the type of statin used
should reflect the treatment goals for a given patient.
The following scheme may be proposed.



- [Evaluate the total CV risk of the individual.]

- [Determine the treatment goals (depending on current risk).]

- [Involve the patient in decisions on CV risk management.]

- [Choose a statin regimen and, where necessary, additional treat-]
ments (e.g. ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors) that can meet the
treatment goals (per cent and absolute value).

- [Response to statin treatment is variable, therefore uptitration of]
the statin dose may be required before additional LDL-lowering
treatments are started.

slightly, increased frequency of muscle symptoms in statinallocated groups. [239][,][240] The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac
Outcomes Trial � Lipid-Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA) study
addressed this issue by comparing the incidence of four different
adverse events, including muscle-related symptoms, during both
the blinded, placebo-controlled trial and its open-label extension
study. [238] They concluded that a nocebo effect (i.e. one caused by
negative expectations) may partly explain the higher frequency of
SAMS in observational studies compared with in trials. Suggested
practical management of muscular symptoms is shown in
[Supplementary Figure 6.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455#supplementary-data) [198][,][234][,][241] Several studies have shown a
considerable LDL-C-lowering effect of alternative dosing, such as
every other day or twice a week, with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. [242] Although no clinical endpoint trials are available, this strategy should be considered in high-risk patients in whom statin
treatment with daily doses is not possible.

8.1.4.2 Adverse effects on the liver. The activity of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in plasma is commonly used to assess hepatocellular

�
damage. Mild elevation of ALT occurs in 0.5 2.0% of patients on statin treatment, more commonly with potent statins or high doses.
The common definition of clinically relevant ALT elevation has been

an increase of three times the ULN on two consecutive occasions.

Mild elevation of ALT has not been shown to be associated with true

hepatotoxicity or changes in liver function. Progression to liver failure
is exceedingly rare, therefore routine monitoring of ALT during statin
treatment is no longer recommended. [243] Patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis have been studied during statin treatment and
there is no indication that statins cause any worsening of liver
disease. [244][�][246]

8.1.4.3 Increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Patients on statin
treatment have been shown to exhibit an increased risk of dysglycaemia and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several studies have shown that this is a consistent, dose-related effect. [232] A minor,

not clinically relevant elevation of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) has
also been observed. The number needed to cause one case of diabetes . [...............................................................................................................]


have yielded conflicting findings and there is a need for further exploration of the risk of haemorrhagic stroke in particular types of
patients. Note, however, that the overall benefit on other stroke subtypes greatly outweighs this small (and uncertain) hazard. [34][,][36]

8.1.4.5 Adverse effects on kidney function. There is no clear evidence
that statins have a clinically significant beneficial or adverse effect on
renal function. [253] An increased frequency of proteinuria has been
reported for all statins, but has been analysed in more detail for rosuvastatin. With a dose of 80 mg, a frequency of 12% was reported.
With the approved doses of <40 mg, the frequency is much lower
and in line with the frequency for other statins. The proteinuria
induced by statins is of tubular origin, usually transitory, and is
believed to be due to reduced tubular reabsorption and not to glomerular dysfunction. [254][,][255] In clinical trials, the frequency of proteinuria is generally low and, in most cases, is not higher than for
placebo. [256]

8.1.4.6 Interactions. A number of important drug interactions with statins have been described that may increase the risk of adverse effects.
Inhibitors and inducers of enzymatic pathways involved in statin
metabolism are summarized in Table 10. All currently available statins—except pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin—undergo
major hepatic metabolism via the CYPs. These isoenzymes are mainly
expressed in the liver and intestine. Pravastatin does not undergo
metabolism through the CYP system, but is metabolized by sulfation
and conjugation. CYP3A4 isoenzymes are the most abundant, but
other isoenzymes such as CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and
CYP2D6 are frequently involved in the metabolism of statins. Thus,
other pharmacological substrates of these CYPs may interfere with
statin metabolism. Conversely, statin therapy may interfere with the
catabolism of other drugs that are metabolized by the same enzy
matic system.
Combination of statins with gemfibrozil enhances the risk of myopathy, and its association with statins must be avoided. There is no or
very little increased risk for myopathy when combining statins with
other fibrates, such as fenofibrate, bezafibrate, or ciprofibrate. [259][,][260]

8.1.4.3 Increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Patients on statin
treatment have been shown to exhibit an increased risk of dysglycaemia and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several studies have shown that this is a consistent, dose-related effect. [232] A minor,

not clinically relevant elevation of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) has

also been observed. The number needed to cause one case of diabetes
has been estimated as 255 over 4 years of statin treatment. [247]

However, the risk is higher with the more potent statins at high
doses, [248] and is also higher in the elderly, and in the presence of other
risk factors for diabetes such as overweight or insulin resistance. [249]

Overall, the absolute reduction in the risk of CVD in high-risk patients
clearly outweighs the possible adverse effects of a small increase in the
incidence of diabetes. [233] This effect is probably related to the mecha
nism of action of statins, as Mendelian randomization studies have con
firmed the increased risk of DM in individuals with HMG-CoA
reductase polymorphisms that reduce cholesterol synthesis. [250]


8.1.4.4 Increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. In observational studies,
TC is negatively associated with haemorrhagic stroke, and in the
CTT meta-analysis, there was a 21% [95% confidence interval (CI)
5�41%; P=0.01] relative increase per mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol in haemorrhagic stroke. [34][,][251][,][252] However, other meta-analyses

8.2 Cholesterol absorption inhibitors

8.2.1 Mechanism of action

Ezetimibe inhibits intestinal uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol
at the level of the brush border of the intestine [by interacting with
the Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 (NPC1L1)] without affecting the
absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. By inhibiting cholesterol absorp
tion, ezetimibe reduces the amount of cholesterol delivered to the

liver. In response to reduced cholesterol delivery, the liver reacts by
upregulating LDLR expression, which in turn leads to increased clear
ance of LDL from the blood.

8.2.2 Effects on lipids
In clinical studies, ezetimibe in monotherapy at 10 mg/day reduces

�
LDL-C in hypercholesterolaemic patients by 15 22% with relatively
high interindividual variation. [261] A meta-analysis of RCTs that
included over 2700 people showed an 18.5% reduction in LDL-C as
compared with placebo. [262] In addition, there was a significant 3%
increase in HDL-C, a significant 8% reduction in TGs, and a 13%
reduction in TC with ezetimibe as compared with placebo.

Ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy reduces LDL-C levels

�
by an additional 21 27% compared with placebo in patients with
hypercholesterolaemia with or without established CHD. In statinnaı¨ve patients, ezetimibe and statin combination therapy has resulted
in around a 15% greater reduction in LDL-C when compared with
the same statins and doses in monotherapy. In other studies, this
combination has also significantly improved reductions in LDL-C lev
�
els when compared with doubling of the statin dose (13 20%), and
after switching from statin monotherapy to ezetimibe and statin com
�
bination therapy (11 15%). [263]

Co-administration of ezetimibe and bile acid sequestrants (colesevelam, colestipol, or cholestyramine) has been reported to result in

�
an additional reduction of LDL-C levels by 10 20% when compared
with the stable bile acid sequestrant regimen alone. [264] Co
administration of ezetimibe with PCSK9 inhibitors also results in an
additional effect. [265]

8.2.3 Effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
The efficacy of ezetimibe in association with simvastatin has been
addressed in people with aortic stenosis in the Simvastatin and
Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) trial, [266] and in patients with CKD
in the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) trial. [222] In both

the SEAS and SHARP trials, a reduction in CV events was demonstrated in the simvastatin�ezetimibe arm vs. placebo. [266][,][267]

In the Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy
International Trial (IMPROVE-IT), ezetimibe was added to simvastatin (40 mg) in patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). [33] A
total of 18 144 patients were randomized to statin or statin plus ezetimibe, and 5314 patients over 7 years experienced a CV event; 170
fewer events (32.7 vs. 34.7%) were recorded in the group taking simvastatin plus ezetimibe (P=0.016). The average LDL-C during the
study was 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in the simvastatin group and 1.4
mmol/L (55 mg/dL) in patients taking ezetimibe plus simvastatin. Also,
ischaemic stroke was reduced by 21% in this trial (P=0.008). There
was no evidence of harm caused by ezetimibe or the further LDL-C
reduction. In this group of patients already treated with statins to

although significant and in line with the CTT expectations. [268]

Therefore, the study supports the proposition that LDL-C lowering
by means other than statins is beneficial and safe. The beneficial effect
of ezetimibe is also supported by genetic studies of mutations in
NPC1L1; naturally occurring mutations that inactivate the protein
were found to be associated with reduced plasma LDL-C and
reduced risk for CAD. [55][,][269][,][270]

Taken together with other studies, [271] IMPROVE-IT supports the
proposal that ezetimibe should be used as second-line therapy in
association with statins when the therapeutic goal is not achieved at

the maximal tolerated statin dose, or in cases where a statin cannot
be prescribed. [272][,][273]

8.2.4 Adverse effects and interactions

Ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized to pharmacologically active ezetimibe glucuronide. The recommended dose
of ezetimibe of 10 mg/day can be administered in the morning or evening irrespective of food intake. There are no clinically significant
effects of age, sex, or race on ezetimibe pharmacokinetics, and no
dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment or mild-to-severe renal insufficiency. Life-threatening liver failure with ezetimibe as monotherapy or in combination with statins is
extremely rare. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy does not
appear to increase the incidence of elevated CK levels beyond what
is noted with statin treatment alone. [261]

8.3 Bile acid sequestrants

8.3.1 Mechanism of action

Bile acids are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and are

released into the intestinal lumen, but most of the bile acid is

returned to the liver from the terminal ileum via active absorption.
The two older bile acid sequestrants, cholestyramine and colestipol,
are both bile acid-binding exchange resins. The synthetic drug colesevelam is also available in some countries. As bile acid sequestrants are
not systemically absorbed or altered by digestive enzymes, the beneficial clinical effects are indirect. By binding the bile acids, the drugs
prevent the reabsorption of both the drug and cholesterol into the
blood, and thereby remove a large portion of the bile acids from the
enterohepatic circulation. The liver, depleted of bile, synthesizes
more from hepatic cholesterol, therefore increasing the hepatic
demand for cholesterol and increasing LDLR expression, which
results in a decrease of circulating LDL.

8.3.2 Effects on lipids
At the top daily dose of 24 g of cholestyramine, 20 g of colestipol, or
4.5 g of colesevelam, a reduction in LDL-C of 18�25% has been
observed. No major effect on HDL-C has been reported, while TGs
may increase in some predisposed patients. [274] Colesevelam can also
reduce glucose levels in hyperglycaemic patients. [275]

8.3.3 Effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
In clinical trials, bile acid sequestrants have contributed greatly to the
demonstration of the efficacy of LDL-C lowering in reducing CV
events in hypercholesterolaemic people, with a benefit proportional
to the degree of LDL-C lowering. Of note, these studies were

an additional reduction of LDL-C levels by 10 20% when compared
with the stable bile acid sequestrant regimen alone. [264] Co
administration of ezetimibe with PCSK9 inhibitors also results in an
additional effect. [265]


8.2.3 Effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
The efficacy of ezetimibe in association with simvastatin has been
addressed in people with aortic stenosis in the Simvastatin and
Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) trial, [266] and in patients with CKD
in the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) trial. [222] In both

the SEAS and SHARP trials, a reduction in CV events was demonstrated in the simvastatin�ezetimibe arm vs. placebo. [266][,][267]

In the Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy
International Trial (IMPROVE-IT), ezetimibe was added to simvastatin (40 mg) in patients after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). [33] A
total of 18 144 patients were randomized to statin or statin plus ezetimibe, and 5314 patients over 7 years experienced a CV event; 170
fewer events (32.7 vs. 34.7%) were recorded in the group taking simvastatin plus ezetimibe (P=0.016). The average LDL-C during the
study was 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in the simvastatin group and 1.4
mmol/L (55 mg/dL) in patients taking ezetimibe plus simvastatin. Also,
ischaemic stroke was reduced by 21% in this trial (P=0.008). There
was no evidence of harm caused by ezetimibe or the further LDL-C
reduction. In this group of patients already treated with statins to
reach goals, the absolute CV benefit from added ezetimibe was small,

performed before many of the modern treatment options were
available. [276][�][278]

8.3.4 Adverse effects and interactions

Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects (most commonly flatulence,
constipation, dyspepsia, and nausea) are often present with these
drugs, even at low doses, which limits their practical use. These
adverse effects can be attenuated by beginning treatment at low
doses and ingesting ample fluid with the drug. The dose should be
increased gradually. Reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins has
been reported. Furthermore, these drugs may increase circulating
TG levels in certain patients.
Bile acid sequestrants have major drug interactions with several
commonly prescribed drugs, and must therefore be administered
either 4 h before or 1 h after other drugs. Colesevelam is better tolerated and has fewer interactions with other drugs, and can be taken
together with statins and several other drugs. [279]

8.4 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
type 9 inhibitors

8.4.1 Mechanism of action

Recently, a new class of drugs, PCSK9 inhibitors, has become available that targets a protein (PCSK9) involved in the control of the
LDLR. [280] Elevated concentration or function of this protein in
plasma reduces LDLR expression by promoting, upon binding,
LDLR lysosomal catabolism and a subsequent increase in plasma

LDL concentrations, while lower concentration or function of
PCSK9 is related to lower plasma LDL-C levels. [281] Therapeutic
strategies have been developed mainly using mAbs; the mechanism of action relates to the reduction of the plasma level of

PCSK9, which in turn is not available to bind the LDLR. Since this

interaction triggers the intracellular degradation of the LDLR,
lower levels of circulating PCSK9 will result in increased expres
sion of LDLRs at the cell surface and therefore in a reduction of
circulating LDL-C levels. [281] Currently, the only approved PCSK9
inhibitors are two fully human mAbs, alirocumab and evolocumab.
Statin treatment increases circulating PCSK9 serum levels, [282] and

thus the best effect of these mAbs has been demonstrated in com
bination with statins.

8.4.2 Effects on lipids
8.4.2.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In clinical trials, alirocumab

and evolocumab—either alone or in combination with statins, and/or

other lipid-lowering therapies—have been shown to significantly
reduce LDL-C levels on average by 60%, depending on dose. The efficacy appears to be largely independent of any background therapy. In
combination with high-intensity or maximally tolerated statins, aliro
�
cumab and evolocumab reduced LDL-C by 46 73% more than placebo, and by 30% more than ezetimibe. Among patients in whom
statins cannot be prescribed, PCSK9 inhibition reduced LDL-C when
administered in combination with ezetimibe. [283] Both alirocumab and

evolocumab have also been shown to effectively lower LDL-C levels
in patients who are at high CV risk, including those with DM. [284]

Given the mechanism of action, these drugs are effective at reducing LDL-C in all patients capable of expressing LDLR in the liver.

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


majority of patients, including those with HeFH and, albeit to a lower
level, those with HoFH with residual LDLR expression. Receptordeficient HoFH responds poorly to the therapy. [285]

8.4.2.2 Triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These
highly efficacious LDL-lowering agents also lower TG levels, and
increase those of HDL-C and ApoA-I as a function of the dosing regimen. In phase II trials, evolocumab lowered TG levels by 26%, and
raised HDL-C and ApoA-I by 9 and 4%, respectively; similar findings
have been reported for alirocumab. [286][,][287] However, the TG effect
must be confirmed in populations with higher starting plasma TG

levels.

8.4.2.3 Lipoprotein(a). In contrast to statins, inhibiting PCSK9 with
mAbs also reduces Lp(a) plasma levels. Pooled results of phase II
trials have shown that treatment leads to an Lp(a) reduction of
about 30�40%. [288][,][289] While recent investigations have attempted
to unravel the mechanism, it remains unclear. However, it appears

to be distinct from that of statins, which also enhance LDLR func
tion but do not lower circulating Lp(a) levels in humans. The rela
tive contribution of this effect to the reduction of risk remains to be

addressed in appropriately designed studies.

8.4.3 Effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
Early preliminary data from phase III trials suggests a reduction of CV
events in line with the LDL-C reduction achieved. [286][,][290][,][291]

Recently, two major studies were completed: the Further

Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in

Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) and the Evaluation of
Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome
During Treatment With Alirocumab (ODYSSEY Outcomes) trials. [119][,][120] The designs of the trials were similar with regard to the settings of secondary prevention and background therapy; however, the
populations enrolled had either stable CHD, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), or stroke; or a recent (median 2.6 months) ACS, respectively. The relative benefit ranged from 15�20% reductions in the
risk of the primary endpoints. Both studies had relatively short
follow-up periods and the evidence from statin trials indicates that
the clinical benefits of LDL-lowering may only emerge after about 1
year, [51] so these trials may have underestimated the potential impact
of longer-term treatment. [120][,][290]

In the FOURIER trial, [119] 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic
CVD, and LDL-C levels of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or higher who
were receiving statin therapy, were randomly assigned to receive
evolocumab or placebo. Allocation to evolocumab reduced median
LDL-C from 2.38 mmol/L (92 mg/dL) at baseline to a mean of 0.78
mmol/L (30 mg/dL) at 48 weeks. After a median follow-up of 2.2
years, evolocumab treatment significantly reduced the risk of the primary endpoint (composite of CV death, MI, stroke, hospitalization
for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization) by 15% [hazard

�
ratio (HR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 0.92]. An analysis of the time to benefit
also showed that there was a lower benefit in the first year than in
subsequent years, consistent with the effects of statins observed
within the CTT meta-analysis. [268] In the FOURIER trial, allocation to
evolocumab did not reduce the risk of CV mortality (HR 1.05, 95%
CI 0.88�1.25) or all-cause mortality.


8.3.4 Adverse effects and interactions

Gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effects (most commonly flatulence,
constipation, dyspepsia, and nausea) are often present with these
drugs, even at low doses, which limits their practical use. These
adverse effects can be attenuated by beginning treatment at low
doses and ingesting ample fluid with the drug. The dose should be
increased gradually. Reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins has
been reported. Furthermore, these drugs may increase circulating
TG levels in certain patients.
Bile acid sequestrants have major drug interactions with several
commonly prescribed drugs, and must therefore be administered
either 4 h before or 1 h after other drugs. Colesevelam is better tolerated and has fewer interactions with other drugs, and can be taken
together with statins and several other drugs. [279]

plasma reduces LDLR expression by promoting, upon binding,

LDL concentrations, while lower concentration or function of
PCSK9 is related to lower plasma LDL-C levels. [281] Therapeutic

PCSK9, which in turn is not available to bind the LDLR. Since this

interaction triggers the intracellular degradation of the LDLR,
lower levels of circulating PCSK9 will result in increased expres
sion of LDLRs at the cell surface and therefore in a reduction of
circulating LDL-C levels. [281] Currently, the only approved PCSK9
inhibitors are two fully human mAbs, alirocumab and evolocumab.
Statin treatment increases circulating PCSK9 serum levels, [282] and

thus the best effect of these mAbs has been demonstrated in com
bination with statins.


8.4.2 Effects on lipids
8.4.2.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In clinical trials, alirocumab

and evolocumab—either alone or in combination with statins, and/or

other lipid-lowering therapies—have been shown to significantly
reduce LDL-C levels on average by 60%, depending on dose. The efficacy appears to be largely independent of any background therapy. In
combination with high-intensity or maximally tolerated statins, aliro
�
cumab and evolocumab reduced LDL-C by 46 73% more than placebo, and by 30% more than ezetimibe. Among patients in whom
statins cannot be prescribed, PCSK9 inhibition reduced LDL-C when
administered in combination with ezetimibe. [283] Both alirocumab and

evolocumab have also been shown to effectively lower LDL-C levels
in patients who are at high CV risk, including those with DM. [284]

Given the mechanism of action, these drugs are effective at reducing LDL-C in all patients capable of expressing LDLR in the liver.
Therefore, this pharmacological approach is effective in the vast

142 ESC/EAS Guidelines


The ODYSSEY Outcomes trial randomized 18924 patients after
hospitalization for acute MI or unstable angina, treated with statins,
and with LDL-C >_1.8 mmol/L (>_70 mg/dL), non-HDL cholesterol
>_2.6 mmol/L (>_100 mg/dL), or ApoB >_80 mg/dL, to receive injections of alirocumab or matching placebo. Allocation to alirocumab
reduced the mean baseline LDL-C from 2.38 mmol/L (92 mg/dL) to
1.24 mmol/L (48 mg/dL) at 12 months. There was a 15% relative
reduction in the primary outcome (composite of CHD death, nonfatal MI, ischaemic stroke, or unstable angina requiring hospitaliza
�
tion) (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 0.93) after a median follow-up of 2.8
years. [120] Although there was a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in the ODYSSEY trial, this was an exploratory outcome and
was not supported by a significant effect on CV death.

8.4.4 Adverse effects and interactions

Anti-PCSK9 mAbs are injected subcutaneously, every other week or
once a month, at different doses depending on the agent used. The
potential for interaction with orally absorbed drugs is absent, as they
will not interfere with pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.
Among the most frequently reported side effects are itching at the
site of injection and flu-like symptoms. [292] In some studies, an increase
of patient-reported neurocognitive effects has been described. [293]

However, the EBBINGHAUS trial, [231] which was specifically designed
to detect neurocognitive function changes, was reassuring, as were
the safety reports in both the FOURIER and ODYSSEY trials.
Mendelian randomization studies have also suggested that PCSK9
inhibition may increase the risk of DM with an LDL-C-related effect,
as apparently occurs for statins. [294] To date, no signal has emerged
from RCTs. [295][�][297] Although large long-term trials of PCSK9 inhibitors are needed to rule out these and other potential side effects of
inhibition of PCSK9, [298] 7 year data from the IMPROVE-IT study have
shown that prolonged low LDL-C concentrations are not associated
with any clear adverse effects. [299]

A potential problem of long-term antibody treatment is the occurrence of autoantibodies. Evolocumab and alirocumab are fully human
antibodies and, therefore, theoretically less likely to induce autoantibodies. To date, only very few cases of antidrug antibodies have been
reported, and no reduction of LDL-C lowering has been observed,
but long-term use needs to be monitored. Indeed, the development
programme for a third PCSK9 inhibitor, bococizumab, a humanized
antibody, was discontinued because of an increase of neutralizing
antibodies, which resulted in the attenuation of the LDL-C-lowering
effect over time, as well as a higher rate of injection site reactions. [300]

However, although PCSK9 inhibitors are very effective drugs that can
reduce LDL-C and CV events on top of statin and/or ezetimibe treatment, considering the costs of the treatments and the limited data on
long-term safety, these drugs are likely to be considered costeffective only in those patients at very high-risk of ASCVD, and their
use may not be possible in some countries with limited healthcare

resources.

step in the formation of VLDL. MTP inhibition thus prevents the for

Lomitapide is an MTP inhibitor designed for o.d. oral treatment of
HoFH. In an open-label, single-arm titration study evaluating lomitapide as adjunct therapy to statins, with or without apheresis and a
low-fat diet, [301] LDL-C was reduced by 50% from baseline at 26
weeks and by 44% at 56 weeks. Lomitapide was also shown to
decrease the frequency of apheresis in HoFH patients. It should be
noted that the drug’s effect on CV outcomes has not yet been

determined.

As a consequence of its mechanism of action, lomitapide has been

shown to be associated with increased aminotransferase levels, which

most likely reflects the increased fat in the liver, as well as poor GI
tolerability. [301][,][302] The GI side effects were the most frequent reasons
preventing a further increase in the dose of lomitapide in clinical trials. [301] However, it has been noted that the frequency and intensity of
GI side effects generally decrease with time. Therefore, prescription
of lomitapide requires careful patient education and liver function
monitoring during therapy.

8.6 Mipomersen
Mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide able to bind the messenger RNA (mRNA) of ApoB-100, which triggers the selective degradation of mRNA molecules. After subcutaneous injection, the
oligonucleotide is preferentially transported to the liver, where it
binds to a specific mRNA preventing the translation of ApoB protein
and, consequently, reducing the production of atherogenic lipids and
lipoproteins, including LDL and Lp(a). [303] An adjunct to lipid-lowering
medications and diet, mipomersen is indicated to reduce LDL-C in
patients with HoFH. Mipomersen is currently approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but not by the European
Medicines Agency (EMA).

Reactions at the injection site are the most common adverse
effects observed in patients treated with mipomersen. [304] However,
the main concerns regarding mipomersen’s safety are related to liver
toxicity. Mipomersen may lead to the development of steatosis.
Treated patients have shown a higher increase of liver fat from baseline compared with patients randomized to placebo. [303] The efficacy
and safety of long-term mipomersen treatment are currently under
evaluation in patients with severe HeFH, and in statin-‘intolerant’

patients.

8.7 Fibrates

8.7.1 Mechanism of action

Fibrates are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptora (PPAR-a), acting via transcription factors regulating, among other
things, various steps in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. As a consequence, fibrates have good efficacy in lowering fasting TG levels, as
well as post-prandial TGs and TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) remnant
particles.

8.7.2 Effects on lipids
Clinical impacts on lipid profiles vary among members of the fibrate

class, but are estimated to reach a 50% reduction of the TG level, a

<_20% reduction of the LDL-C level (but a paradoxical small LDL-C
increase may be observed with high TG levels), and an increase of
the HDL-C level of <_20%. The magnitude of effect is highly dependent on the baseline lipid levels. [305] Both the HDL-raising and


8.4.4 Adverse effects and interactions

Anti-PCSK9 mAbs are injected subcutaneously, every other week or
once a month, at different doses depending on the agent used. The
potential for interaction with orally absorbed drugs is absent, as they
will not interfere with pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.
Among the most frequently reported side effects are itching at the
site of injection and flu-like symptoms. [292] In some studies, an increase
of patient-reported neurocognitive effects has been described. [293]

However, the EBBINGHAUS trial, [231] which was specifically designed
to detect neurocognitive function changes, was reassuring, as were
the safety reports in both the FOURIER and ODYSSEY trials.
Mendelian randomization studies have also suggested that PCSK9
inhibition may increase the risk of DM with an LDL-C-related effect,
as apparently occurs for statins. [294] To date, no signal has emerged
from RCTs. [295][�][297] Although large long-term trials of PCSK9 inhibitors are needed to rule out these and other potential side effects of
inhibition of PCSK9, [298] 7 year data from the IMPROVE-IT study have
shown that prolonged low LDL-C concentrations are not associated
with any clear adverse effects. [299]

A potential problem of long-term antibody treatment is the occurrence of autoantibodies. Evolocumab and alirocumab are fully human
antibodies and, therefore, theoretically less likely to induce autoantibodies. To date, only very few cases of antidrug antibodies have been
reported, and no reduction of LDL-C lowering has been observed,
but long-term use needs to be monitored. Indeed, the development
programme for a third PCSK9 inhibitor, bococizumab, a humanized
antibody, was discontinued because of an increase of neutralizing
antibodies, which resulted in the attenuation of the LDL-C-lowering
effect over time, as well as a higher rate of injection site reactions. [300]

However, although PCSK9 inhibitors are very effective drugs that can
reduce LDL-C and CV events on top of statin and/or ezetimibe treatment, considering the costs of the treatments and the limited data on
long-term safety, these drugs are likely to be considered costeffective only in those patients at very high-risk of ASCVD, and their
use may not be possible in some countries with limited healthcare

resources.


8.5 Lomitapide
The microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP) transfers TGs and phospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum to ApoB, as a necessary
step in the formation of VLDL. MTP inhibition thus prevents the formation of VLDL in the liver and of chylomicrons in the intestine.

ESC/EAS Guidelines 143


TG-lowering effects of fibrates have been reported to be markedly
less (�5 and �20%, respectively) in long-term intervention trials in
people with T2DM but without elevated levels of TGs. [306][,][307]

8.7.3 Effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
The clinical effects of fibrates have been primarily illustrated by six
RCTs: the Helsinki Heart Study (HHS), Veterans Affairs High Density
Lipoprotein Intervention Trial (VA-HIT), Bezafibrate Infarction
Prevention (BIP), Lower Extremity Arterial Disease Event Reduction
(LEADER), Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes
(FIELD), and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes
(ACCORD) trials; in the latter trial, fenofibrate was added to statin
therapy. [306][�][311] In CV outcome trials of fibrates, the risk reduction
appeared to be proportional to the degree of non-HDL-C
lowering. [50]

Although the HHS reported a significant reduction in CVD outcomes with gemfibrozil, neither the FIELD nor the ACCORD studies
involving fenofibrate showed a reduction in total CVD outcomes.
The LEADER trial included male participants with lower-extremity

arterial disease and failed to show that bezafibrate could lead to a

clinically important reduction in CVD combined endpoints.
Decreases in the rates of non-fatal MI were reported, although often
as a result of post hoc analyses. The effect was most evident in people

with elevated TG/low HDL-C levels. However, the data on other

outcome parameters have remained equivocal. Only one study,
ACCORD, has analysed the effect of a fibrate as an add-on treatment
to a statin. No overall benefit was reported in two recent meta-analyses. [312][,][313] Results from other meta-analyses suggest reduced major
CVD events in patients with high TGs and low HDL-C in fibratetreated patients, but no decrease in CVD or total mortality. [314][�][316]

Thus, the overall efficacy of fibrates on CVD outcomes is much less
robust than that of statins. Recently, a new selective PPAR-a modulator (pemafibrate) has been reported to have marked efficacy in
reducing TRLs. [317] The study, Pemafibrate to Reduce Cardiovascular
OutcoMes by Reducing Triglycerides IN PatiENts With DiabeTes
(PROMINENT), is an ongoing CVD outcome trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of pemafibrate in some 10 000 high-risk diabetic
patients with high TG and low HDL-C levels. [318] Overall, the potential
CV benefits of fibrates require further confirmation.

8.7.4 Adverse effects and interactions

Fibrates are generally well tolerated with mild adverse effects, GI disturbances being reported in <5% of patients, and skin rashes in
2%. [319] In general, myopathy, liver enzyme elevations, and cholelithiasis represent the most well-known adverse effects associated with
fibrate therapy. [319] The risk of myopathy has been reported to be 5.5fold greater with fibrate monotherapy (mainly with gemfibrozil) compared with a statin, and it varies with different fibrates and statins
used in combination. This is explained by the pharmacological interactions between the metabolism of different fibrates and pathways of
glucuronidation of statins. Gemfibrozil inhibits the metabolism of statins via the glucuronidation pathway, which leads to marked increases
in plasma concentrations of statins. [320] As fenofibrate does not share
the same pharmacokinetic pathways as gemfibrozil, the risk of myo
[319] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


As a class, fibrates have been reported to raise both serum creatinine and homocysteine levels in both short- and long-term studies.
The increase of serum creatinine by fibrate therapy seems to be fully
reversible when the drug is stopped. Data from meta-analyses suggest that a reduction of calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
does not reflect any adverse effects on kidney function. [315] Fibrates
are associated with a slightly increased risk of pancreatitis. [321] The
increase in homocysteine levels caused by fibrates has been considered to be relatively neutral with respect to CVD risk. However, a
fibrate-induced increase in homocysteine may blunt elevation of both
HDL-C and ApoA1 levels, and this effect may contribute to the

smaller than estimated benefits of fenofibrate in CV outcome
parameters. [322]

8.8 n-3 fatty acids

8.8.1 Mechanism of action

The n-3 (or omega-3) fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] can be used at pharmacological doses

�
to lower TGs. n-3 fatty acids (2 4 g/day) affect serum lipids and lipoproteins, in particular VLDL concentrations. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood, although it may be related, at least in part,
to their ability to interact with PPARs and to decreased secretion of
ApoB.

8.8.2 Effects on lipids
n-3 fatty acids reduce TGs, but their effects on other lipoproteins are
trivial. More detailed data on clinical outcomes are needed to justify
wide use of prescription n-3 fatty acids. [323] The recommended doses
of total EPA and DHA to lower TGs have varied between 2�4 g/day.
Three recent studies in people with high TGs using EPA reported a
significant reduction in serum TG levels of up to 45% in a dosedependent manner. [324][�][326] The efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in lowering serum TGs has also been reported in meta-analyses. [157]

Recently, the EpanoVa fOr Lowering Very high triglyceridEs II
(EVOLVE II) trial confirmed the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in lowering serum TGs. [327]

8.8.3 Effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
A Cochrane meta-analysis, including 112 059 people from 79 trials,
reported no overall effect of omega-3 PUFAs on total mortality (rela
�
tive risk 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 1.03) or CV events (relative risk 0.99,
95% Cl 0.94�1.04), with only a suggestion that omega-3 fatty acids

�
reduced CHD events (relative risk 0.93, 95% Cl 0.88 0.97). [328]

Recently, the A Study of Cardiovascular Events iN Diabetes
(ASCEND) trial, [329] which randomly assigned 15 480 patients with
DM but without atherosclerotic CV disease to n-3 fatty acids or placebo, showed no significant difference in the risk of serious vascular
events after a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (relative risk 1.00, 95% Cl
0.91�1.09).

The data remain inconclusive and the clinical efficacy of omega-3
fatty acids appears to be related to non-lipid effects. [330][,][331] Moreover,
studies with omega-3 fatty acids have suffered from the dose used
(1 g/day), which does not affect plasma lipids to a large extent, as the
dose required to decrease plasma TGs is >2 g/day. The Reduction of
Cardiovascular Events with EPA-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) [195]

aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of omega-3 oil (EPA) on


8.7.3 Effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality

appeared to be proportional to the degree of non-HDL-C
lowering. [50]

Although the HHS reported a significant reduction in CVD outcomes with gemfibrozil, neither the FIELD nor the ACCORD studies

the same pharmacokinetic pathways as gemfibrozil, the risk of myopathy is much less with this combination therapy. [319]

144 ESC/EAS Guidelines


ASCVD outcomes in people with elevated serum TGs; the trial
enrolled �8000 patients on statin therapy, with LDL-C levels
between 1.0�2.6 mmol/L (41�100 mg/dL) and various CV risk factors, including persistent elevated TGs between 1.7�5.6 mmol/L

�
(150 499 mg/dL), and either established ASCVD or DM, and at least
one other CV risk factor. Use of high doses (2 g b.i.d.) of EPA as compared with placebo (mineral oil) resulted in a �25% relative risk
reduction (P < 0.001) in major adverse CV events (MACE). Another
randomized placebo-controlled trial, Outcomes Study to Assess
STatin Residual Risk Reduction with EpaNova in HiGh CV Risk
PatienTs with Hypertriglyceridemia (STRENGTH), [332] which aims to

determine whether reduction of TRLs and remnants in statin-treated

patients will provide additional ASCVD risk reduction, is ongoing.
The VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), which reported
recently, was a 2�2 factorial design study in which healthy participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to either vitamin D3 (at a
dose of 2000 IU per day) vs. matching placebo, and n-3 fatty acids (1
g per day as a fish-oil capsule containing 840 mg of n-3 fatty acids,
including 460 mg of EPA and 380 mg of DHA) vs. matching placebo.
It showed that supplementation with either n-3 fatty acids at a dose
of 1 g/day, or vitamin D3 at a dose of 2000 IU/day, was not effective
for primary prevention of CV or cancer events among healthy
middle-aged men and women over 5 years of follow-up. [333]

8.8.4 Safety and interactions
The administration of n-3 fatty acids appears to be safe and devoid of
clinically significant interactions. The most common side effect is GI
disturbance. The antithrombotic effects may increase the propensity
for bleeding, especially when given in addition to aspirin/clopidogrel.
Recently, data from one study have associated a risk of prostate cancer with high dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs. [334]

8.9 Nicotinic acid

Nicotinic acid has key action sites in both the liver and adipose tissue.
In the liver, nicotinic acid inhibits diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2
resulting in decreased secretion of VLDL particles, which is also
reflected in reductions of plasma levels of both IDL and LDL particles. [335] Nicotinic acid primarily raises HDL-C and ApoA1 by stimulating ApoA1 production in the liver. [335] Two large randomized trials
with nicotinic acid—one with extended-release niacin [66] and one with
niacin plus laropiprant [67] —have shown no beneficial effect and an
increased frequency of serious adverse effects. No medication containing nicotinic acid is currently approved in Europe.

8.10 Cholesteryl ester transfer protein
inhibitors

To date, the pharmacological approach that has led to the greatest
elevations in HDL-C levels has been direct inhibition of CETP by
small-molecule inhibitors, which may induce an increase in HDL-C by
>_100% on a dose-dependent basis. Torcetrapib was studied in the
Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in
Atherosclerotic Events (ILLUMINATE) trial, which was stopped early
due to increased mortality. [336] Dalcetrapib raises HDL-C levels by
30�40% with no appreciable effect on LDL-C, offering specific insight
into pure HDL-C raising. However, dalcetrapib failed to show any

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


which raises HDL-C levels by 130% and lowers LDL-C by 37%, was
studied in the ACCELERATE trial, [63] which was terminated due to

futility. Recently, anacetrapib, which raises HDL-C and ApoA-I levels
(by 104 and 36%, respectively), and lowers LDL-C and ApoB (by 17
and 18%, respectively), was studied in the REVEAL trial. Anacetrapib
reduced major coronary events by 9% over a median of 4.1 years. [64]

The magnitude of the relative risk reduction appeared to be consistent with the magnitude of LDL-C- or non-HDL-C-level lowering. [337]

This drug has not been submitted for regulatory approval.

8.11 Future perspectives
8.11.1 New approaches to reduce low-density lipoprotein

cholesterol

An alternative approach targeting PCSK9 consists of RNA interference. In a phase I and a phase II trial, the small interfering RNA
(siRNA) molecule inclisiran—which inhibits the synthesis of
PCSK9—reduced LDL-C by up to 50% and the reduction was dosedependent. Reductions in PCSK9 and LDL-C levels were maintained
for <_6 months. [338][,][339] No specific serious adverse events were
observed. HPS4/TIMI65/ORION4, with a planned mean duration of
5 years, is currently comparing inclisiran vs. placebo among 15 000
patients with a prior MI or stroke.

Bempedoic acid is a novel, first-in-class, oral small molecule that
inhibits cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the action of ATP citrate
lyase, a cytosolic enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase. [340] So far, it has been tested in diabetic patients,
and patients with or without statin ‘intolerance’. In monotherapy, bempedoic acid reduces LDL-C levels by �30% and by about 50% in combination with ezetimibe. Bempedoic acid is currently being tested in
phase III trials and some trials have been completed. [341][,][342]

8.11.2 New approaches to reduce triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants
As genetic studies indicate that angiopoietin-like protein 3
(ANGPTL3) deficiency protects against atherosclerotic disease and
that this relationship is causal, [343] an ANGPTL3 antibody (evinacumab) is being developed. Evinacumab has been shown to decrease
TGs, LDL-C, and Lp(a) levels in HoFH patients. [344] Another approach
that is currently being investigated is the inhibition of ANGPTL3 production by antisense oligonucleotides. [345] IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx, an
antisense oligonucleotide targeting ANGPTL3, another critical protein in the clearance of TRLs, reduces plasma TGs by about 85%.
Thus, the future may yield tools to improve TRL clearance that will
be reflected in the atherogenic load of the remnant particles.

The rapid development of gene-silencing technology has allowed
proteins (ApoC-III) that are critical in the regulation of TRL clearance
processes to be targeted. A second-generation antisense oligonucleotide targeting ApoC-III mRNA has been developed. [346] Two
phase III trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of volanesorsen
in patients with elevated TG levels. [347][,][348] Volanesorsen reduced
plasma TGs by �70% and ApoC-III by 80�90%. [349] The EMA recently
issued a marketing authorization for Waylivra (volanesorsen) as an
adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial
chylomicronaemia syndrome (FCS) who are at high-risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and TG-lowering therapy has been
inadequate.


8.8.4 Safety and interactions
The administration of n-3 fatty acids appears to be safe and devoid of
clinically significant interactions. The most common side effect is GI
disturbance. The antithrombotic effects may increase the propensity
for bleeding, especially when given in addition to aspirin/clopidogrel.
Recently, data from one study have associated a risk of prostate cancer with high dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs. [334]


8.9 Nicotinic acid

Nicotinic acid has key action sites in both the liver and adipose tissue.
In the liver, nicotinic acid inhibits diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2
resulting in decreased secretion of VLDL particles, which is also
reflected in reductions of plasma levels of both IDL and LDL particles. [335] Nicotinic acid primarily raises HDL-C and ApoA1 by stimulating ApoA1 production in the liver. [335] Two large randomized trials

benefit in ACS patients in the dal-OUTCOMES trial. Evacetrapib,

8.11.3 New approaches to increase high-density lipopro
tein cholesterol

Although genetic studies suggest that low HDL-C levels are not a
cause of ASCVD, casting doubt on the possibilities of future treatment options to raising HDL-C levels with attenuation of CVD,
major developments in the search for efficacious agents to raise
HDL-C and ApoA1 levels with concomitant benefits on atheroscle
rosis and CV events are on the horizon. On the one hand, interest is

focused on ApoA1 mimetic peptides and recombinant forms of HDL
possessing potential for in vivo HDL particle remodelling and
enhanced cardioprotective activity. [350] On the other, agents that
enhance catabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins, such as the antisense oligonucleotide to ApoC-III, and which lead to a concomitant reduction
in TGs (�70%) and a marked elevation in HDL-C (�40%) in hypertriglyceridemia, are under development. [351] Importantly, however, we
currently lack understanding of the relationship between the modality of raising HDL/ApoA-I levels and a possible antiatherogenic function of HDL particles.

8.11.4 New approaches to reduce lipoprotein(a) levels
Another approach under study is the selective decrease of Lp(a) concentrations. RNA-based therapies are now being evaluated in clinical
settings. Results from studies of an antisense oligonucleotide in
patients with normal Lp(a) values as well as in patients with elevated
Lp(a) concentrations have shown a reduction of >90%. [352] These
approaches are currently being evaluated in phase II�III studies and
an outcome trial is planned to study whether Lp(a) reduction trans
lates into risk reduction.

8.12 Strategies to control plasma
cholesterol . [..............................................................................................]


Although LDL-C goals are attained with monotherapy in many
patients, a significant proportion of patients at high-risk or with very
high LDL-C levels need additional treatment. In this case, combination therapy is reasonable. In patients at very-high risk and with persistent high-risk despite being treated with a maximally tolerated

statin, combination with ezetimibe is recommended and, if still not at

goal, the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor is recommended (see Figure 4
and Recommendations for pharmacological low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering). Of note, addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor directly to a statin is also feasible [120][,][290] (Figure 4).

As shown in Figure 3, the expected clinical benefit of treatment to
lower the LDL-C level of any person can be estimated; it depends on
the intensity of therapy, the baseline LDL-C level, and the baseline
estimated risk of ASCVD. This simple algorithm can be used to help
clinicians select the appropriate therapy and quantify the expected
benefits of LDL-C-lowering therapy to help inform discussions with
[patients. For ease of reference, Supplementary Table 3 provides a](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz455#supplementary-data)
summary of the absolute LDL-C reductions that can be achieved
with various therapeutic approaches at particular baseline levels of

LDL-C.

8.13 Strategies to control plasma
triglycerides
Although CVD risk is increased when fasting TGs are >1.7 mmol/L
(>150 mg/dL), [56] the use of drugs to lower TG levels may only be
considered in high-risk patients when TGs are >2.3 mmol/L (>200
mg/dL) and TGs cannot be lowered by lifestyle measures. The available pharmacological interventions include statins, fibrates, PCSK9
inhibitors, and n-3 PUFAs. A meta-analysis of 10 trials included people treated with various agents that reduce serum TGs (fibrates, niacin, and n-3 PUFAs) and reported a 12% reduction in CV


8.11.4 New approaches to reduce lipoprotein(a) levels
Another approach under study is the selective decrease of Lp(a) concentrations. RNA-based therapies are now being evaluated in clinical
settings. Results from studies of an antisense oligonucleotide in
patients with normal Lp(a) values as well as in patients with elevated
Lp(a) concentrations have shown a reduction of >90%. [352] These
approaches are currently being evaluated in phase II�III studies and
an outcome trial is planned to study whether Lp(a) reduction trans
lates into risk reduction.

Figure 3 Expected clinical benefits of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapies. The expected clinical benefits of treatment to lower lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol for any person can be estimated; it depends on the intensity of therapy, the baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
level, the expected absolute achieved reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the baseline estimated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease. The intensity of therapy should be selected to achieve the recommended proportional reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol based on
the person’s estimated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Multiplying the proportional reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by a
person’s baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level estimates the expected absolute reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that is likely
to be achieved with that therapy. Because each 1.0 mmol/L absolute reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with a 20% reduction in
the risk of cardiovascular events, larger absolute reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lead to larger proportional reductions in risk.
Multiplying the proportional reduction in risk expected for the achieved absolute reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by a person’s estimated
baseline risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease determines the expected absolute risk reduction for that person. LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol; PCSK9 = proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9.

statin-treated patients with high CV risk with fasting TG levels
between 135�499 mg/dL (1.52�1.63 mmol/L), high-dose icosapent
ethyl, a highly purified and stable EPA (2 g) taken b.i.d., significantly
reduced the risk of ischaemic events, including CV death, by about
one-quarter over a median follow-up of 4.9 years. In addition, the

### 9 Management of dyslipidaemias in different clinical settings

9.1 Familial dyslipidaemias
Plasma lipid levels are, to a very large extent, determined by genetic
factors. In its more extreme forms this is manifested as familial dyslipi
. [.......................................................................................................................................................]


among these, FH is the most common and is strongly related to CVD
(Table 11). In general, in a patient with dyslipidaemia, the pattern of
inheritance commonly does not suggest that there is a major single
gene (monogenic) disorder causing the abnormality; rather, it stems
from the inheritance of more than one gene variant affecting lipoprotein metabolism that, on its own, might have relatively little effect, but
in combination with another or others has a greater influence on TC,
TGs, or HDL-C. The pattern of inheritance is polygenic. [357] It is common to find that high LDL-C, high TG, or low HDL-C levels affect
several family members.

9.1.1 Familial combined hyperlipidaemia
Familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCH) is a highly prevalent mixed

�
dyslipidaemia (1:100 200) characterized by elevated levels of LDLC, TGs, or both, and is an important cause of premature CAD. FCH
is a complex disease, and the phenotype is determined by the interaction of multiple susceptibility genes and the environment. It has considerable overlap with the dyslipidaemic phenotypes of T2DM and
MetS. Even within a family, the phenotype shows high inter- and intrapersonal variability based on lipid values (TGs, LDL-C, HDL-C, and
ApoB). FCH has no monogenic component and is not linked to a single genetic cause, but the phenotype is high LDL-C and/or high
TGs. [358][,][359] Therefore, the diagnosis is commonly missed in clinical
practice; the combination of ApoB >120 mg/dL and TGs >1.5 mmol/
L (>133 mg/dL) with a family history of premature CVD can be used
to identify people who most probably have FCH. [360]

The concept of mixed dyslipidaemia is also valuable clinically in
assessing CV risk. It emphasizes both the importance of considering
family history in deciding how rigorously to treat dyslipidaemia and
that elevated LDL-C levels portend a higher risk when HTG is also
present. Statin treatment decreases CV risk by the same relative
amount in people with HTG as in those without. Because the absolute risk is often greater in those with HTG, they may therefore benefit greatly from LDL-lowering therapy.

9.1.2 Familial hypercholesterolaemia
9.1.2.1 Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. FH is a common
codominant monogenic dyslipidaemia causing premature CVD due
to lifelong elevation of plasma levels of LDL-C. If left untreated, men
and women with HeFH typically develop early CAD before the ages
of 55 and 60 years respectively. The risk of CHD among individuals
with definite or probable HeFH is estimated to be increased at least
10-fold. However, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can dramatically reduce the risk for CAD.
The prevalence of HeFH in the population is estimated to be
1/200�250, [361] translating to a total number of cases between 14�34
million worldwide. [362][,][363] Only a minor fraction of these cases is identified and properly treated.

150 ESC/EAS Guidelines


FH is a monogenic disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in
the LDLR or apoB genes, or a gain-of-function mutation in the PCSK9
gene; around 95% of FH cases are caused by mutations in LDLR. More

than 1000 different mutations that cause FH have been identified in

LDLR. The different mutations cause reduced function or complete
loss-of-function, the latter being associated with more severe hyper
cholesterolaemia and CVD.

The diagnosis of FH is usually based on clinical presentation. The
commonly used criteria from the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network are
shown in Table 12. Other criteria are the Simon Broome register or
the WHO criteria. [364][,][365]

The diagnosis can be verified by showing causative mutations in
the pathogenic genes. However, in most studies, the frequency of
detectable mutations in patients with a clinically definite or probable
HeFH is between 60�80%. This suggests that a considerable proportion of patients with FH have either a polygenic cause of the disease
or that other genes, yet to be identified, are involved.
Genetic testing and cascade screening. Probands (index cases) should
be identified according to the following criteria:

 - [TC >_8 mmol/L (>_310 mg/dL) without treatment in an adult or]
adult family member (or >95th percentile by age and gender for
country);

 - [Premature CHD in the patient or a family member;]

 - [Tendon xanthomas in the patient or a family member; or]

 - [Sudden premature cardiac death in a family member.]

Cascade screening of family members of a known index case
allows for the efficient identification of new cases. Cascade screening
is best performed by a lipid clinic. In most families, the cases may be
identified with TC or LDL-C analysis; however, genetic testing is rec
ommended when the causative mutation is known.

Cholesterol-lowering treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after a diagnosis has been made. To improve risk assessment,
the use of imaging techniques to detect asymptomatic atherosclerosis
is recommended. The concept of cumulative cholesterol burden
illustrates the importance of early treatment (for children, see
below). Treatment should be initiated with high-intensity statin therapy, in most cases in combination with ezetimibe. In FH patients at
very-high risk of ASCVD due to a prior history of ASCVD or another
major risk factor, LDL-C goals are a >_50% reduction of LDL-C from
baseline and an LDL-C <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL). In the absence of
ASCVD or another major risk factor, patients with FH are categorized as high-risk, and LDL-C goals are a >_50% reduction of LDL-C
from baseline and an LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL).
PCSK9 inhibitors lower LDL-C levels by up to 60% on top of statins. Two RCTs have reported a beneficial effect on clinical endpoints
in ASCVD patients without FH. [119][,][120] PCSK9 inhibitors are recommended in very-high-risk patients with FH if the treatment goal is not
achieved on maximal tolerated statin plus ezetimibe. PCSK9 inhibitors are also recommended in FH patients who cannot tolerate
statins. [366][,][367]

9.1.2.2 Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. HoFH is a rare and
life-threatening disease. The clinical picture is characterized by extensive xanthomas, marked premature and progressive CVD, and TC
>13 mmol/L (>500 mg/dL). Most patients develop CAD and aortic
stenosis before the age of 20 years and die before 30 years of age.
The frequency of HoFH is estimated to be 1/160000�1/320 000.
The early identification of these children and prompt referral to a
specialized clinic is crucial. The patients should be treated with intensive LDL-lowering drug therapy and, when available, with lipoprotein

�
apheresis. This treatment (every 1 2 weeks) can decrease plasma

�
LDL-C levels by 55 70%. The procedure frequency may be adjusted
for each patient as lipid levels, symptoms, and other disease-related
parameters change. Maximally tolerated pharmacological therapy
must be maintained. [368] For a more detailed discussion on HoFH, see
the EAS consensus statements. [366][,][368]

9.1.2.3 Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children. FH is diagnosed in
children based on phenotypic criteria including elevated LDL-C plus a
family history of elevated LDL-C, premature CAD, and/or positive
genetic testing. [369] Testing during childhood is optimal to discriminate
between FH and non-FH using LDL-C. In children with a family history
of high cholesterol or premature CHD, an accepted cut-off is >_4.0
mmol/L (>_160 mg/dL). If a parent has a known genetic defect, the diagnostic level for the child is >_3.5 mmol/L (>_130 mg/dL). If possible,
genetic testing of the child is suggested.

Although there have been no placebo-controlled trials in children,
observational studies have suggested that early treatment can reduce
LDL-C burden, improve endothelial function, substantially attenuate
the development of atherosclerosis, and improve coronary outcomes. [369][�][371] Treatment of children with FH includes a healthy lifestyle and statin treatment. A heart-healthy diet should be adopted

�
early in life and statin treatment should be considered at 6 10 years
of age. Statin treatment should be started with low doses and the
dose should be increased to reach goals. [372] The goal in children >10
years of age is an LDL-C <3.5 mmol/L (<135 mg/dL) and at younger
ages a >_50% reduction of LDL-C.

9.1.3 Familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia
Familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia (i.e. type III hyperlipoproteinaemia;
remnant removal disease) is rare and is generally inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder with variable penetrance. Familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia produces a characteristic clinical syndrome in which
both TC and TGs are elevated before treatment, usually both in the

�
range of 7 10 mmol/L. In severe cases, patients develop tuberoeruptive xanthomas, particularly over the elbows and knees, and palmar

xanthomata in the skin creases of the hands and wrists. The risk of

CAD is very high, and accelerated atherosclerosis of the femoral and
tibial arteries is also prevalent. The syndrome is usually not expressed
at a young age or in women before menopause. The majority of cases
are homozygous for the E2 isoform of ApoE. ApoE is important for
the hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants and IDL. ApoE2 binds
less readily than the E3 and E4 isoforms to hepatic receptors.
However, without some coincidental cause of dyslipidaemia such as
dyslipidaemia associated with HTG, DM, obesity, or hypothyroidism, [373][�][375] ApoE2 homozygosity does not generally cause

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


The detection of ApoE2 homozygosity in a dyslipidaemic patient is
diagnostic and analysis of ApoE isoforms is now available in most
clinical laboratories. The presence of cholesterol remnants characteristic of familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia can be reliably predicted
on the basis of plasma levels of cholesterol, TGs, and ApoB. [376] If suspicion is confirmed, ApoE genotyping can be performed. In older
patients with xanthomata resembling those of familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia who prove not to be homozygous for ApoE2, a paraprotein should be sought. The treatment of familial
dysbetalipoproteinaemia should be undertaken in a specialist clinic.
Most cases respond well to treatment with a statin or, if dominated
by high TGs, a fibrate; often a combination of a statin and a fibrate
may be needed.

9.1.4 Genetic causes of hypertriglyceridaemia
Although the genetic aetiology for HTG seems to be very complex,
recent data have extended our genetic understanding of HTG, in particular that of chylomicronaemia. [37][,][226][,][377] Moderate elevation of TG

�
levels (between 2.0 10.0 mmol/L) is caused by the polygenic effect
of multiple genes influencing both VLDL production and removal.
Monogenic severe HTG causes chylomicronaemia, pancreatitis, and
lipid deposits. Thus far, mutations in six genes (LPL, apoC2, apoA5,
LMF1, GPIHBP1, and GPD1) with monogenic effects have been recognized to lead to severe elevation of serum TGs due to disruption of
the chylomicron removal pathways. These mutations are inherited as
autosomal recessive traits and are rare. The profound defect in the
catabolism of chylomicrons and VLDL results in chylomicronaemia
and TG levels >11.2 mmol/L (>1000 mg/dL), with turbid and milky
serum. Severe HTG is seen in patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations of the enzyme LPL, and in other
genes linked to the catabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins.
Heterozygous carriers of these same gene mutations commonly
express moderate elevations of serum TG levels that expose them
to increased CVD risk. [378] Recently, gene therapy for LPL deficiency
has been developed and tested in clinical trials, [379] and the alipogene
tiparvovec was approved by the EMA in 2013. However, this therapy
is no longer available. A gain-of-function mutation in apoC3 that leads
to high ApoC-III levels can also cause severe HTG by inhibiting the
activity of LPL, whereas loss-of-function mutations are associated
with a favourable lipid profile with low TG levels. [380] These findings
have raised the possibility of ApoC-III being a novel lipid drug target.

9.1.4.1 Action to prevent acute pancreatitis in severe hypertriglyceridaemia. The risk of pancreatitis is clinically significant if TGs are >10 mmol/L
(880 mg/dL), particularly when occurring in association with familial chylomicronaemia, and actions to prevent acute pancreatitis are mandatory. [381][,][382] Notably, HTG is the cause of �10% of all cases with
pancreatitis, and patients can develop pancreatitis even when their TG
concentration is 5�10 mmol/L (440�880 mg/dL). Recent data from a
prospective cohort study reported that the risk of acute pancreatitis
increased significantly over the quartiles of serum TGs, highlighting the
fact that, as a risk factor, serum TGs may have been underestimated. [383]

Any factor that increases VLDL production can aggravate the risk of pancreatitis, with alcohol consumption being the most common contributing
factor. Either a patient should be admitted to hospital if symptomatic, or
careful and close follow-up of the patient’s TG values should be


9.1.2.3 Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children. FH is diagnosed in
children based on phenotypic criteria including elevated LDL-C plus a
family history of elevated LDL-C, premature CAD, and/or positive
genetic testing. [369] Testing during childhood is optimal to discriminate
between FH and non-FH using LDL-C. In children with a family history
of high cholesterol or premature CHD, an accepted cut-off is >_4.0
mmol/L (>_160 mg/dL). If a parent has a known genetic defect, the diagnostic level for the child is >_3.5 mmol/L (>_130 mg/dL). If possible,
genetic testing of the child is suggested.

Although there have been no placebo-controlled trials in children,
observational studies have suggested that early treatment can reduce
LDL-C burden, improve endothelial function, substantially attenuate
the development of atherosclerosis, and improve coronary outcomes. [369][�][371] Treatment of children with FH includes a healthy lifestyle and statin treatment. A heart-healthy diet should be adopted

�
early in life and statin treatment should be considered at 6 10 years
of age. Statin treatment should be started with low doses and the
dose should be increased to reach goals. [372] The goal in children >10
years of age is an LDL-C <3.5 mmol/L (<135 mg/dL) and at younger
ages a >_50% reduction of LDL-C.

remnant removal disease) is rare and is generally inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder with variable penetrance. Familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia produces a characteristic clinical syndrome in which
both TC and TGs are elevated before treatment, usually both in the

�
range of 7 10 mmol/L. In severe cases, patients develop tuberoeruptive xanthomas, particularly over the elbows and knees, and palmar

xanthomata in the skin creases of the hands and wrists. The risk of

CAD is very high, and accelerated atherosclerosis of the femoral and
tibial arteries is also prevalent. The syndrome is usually not expressed
at a young age or in women before menopause. The majority of cases
are homozygous for the E2 isoform of ApoE. ApoE is important for
the hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants and IDL. ApoE2 binds
less readily than the E3 and E4 isoforms to hepatic receptors.
However, without some coincidental cause of dyslipidaemia such as
dyslipidaemia associated with HTG, DM, obesity, or hypothyroidism, [373][�][375] ApoE2 homozygosity does not generally cause
familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia.

undertaken. Restriction of calories and fat content (10�15% recommended) in the diet, and alcohol abstinence are obligatory. Fibrate ther
�
apy (fenofibrate) should be initiated, with n-3 fatty acids (2 4 g/day) as
adjunct therapy. Lomitapide may also be considered in severe cases. [37] In
patients with DM, insulin therapy should be initiated to achieve good glycaemic control. In general, a sharp decrease of TG values is seen within
2�5 days. In the acute setting, plasmapheresis is able to rapidly lower
TG levels. [384] Volanesorsen has been recently approved by the EMA as
an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS who
are at high-risk for pancreatitis.

9.1.5 Other genetic disorders of lipoprotein metabolism
Sometimes patients are encountered with extremely low levels of
LDL-C or HDL-C. The most common form of genetic hypolipidaemia is hypobetalipoproteinaemia, which is dominantly inherited and
often due to truncation of ApoB. Serum LDL-C is typically between
0.5�1.5 mmol/L (20�60 mg/dL). A more profound deficiency of
ApoB occurs in abetalipoproteinaemia when steatorrhoea, and neurological or other complications require specialist treatment. Almost
absent levels of HDL-C occur in Tangier disease (analphalipoproteinaemia) and very low levels of HDL-C occur in lecithin cholesterol
acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency. Both these conditions are associated with distinct clinical syndromes and require specialist investigation. Very high levels of HDL-C are detected in patients with CETP
deficiency. In the heterozygous form, levels of 2.0�2.3 mmol/L

�
(80 90 mg/dL) are typically observed, and levels >_5 mmol/L (>_200
mg/dL) are observed in homozygotes. This is not associated with
atherosclerotic disease and may be associated with reduced risk.
Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency or cholesterol ester storage disease (in children with Wolman disease) is a rare cause (recessive
transmission) of elevated LDL-C and low HDL-C, accompanied by
hepatomegaly and microvesicular hepatosteatosis. Statin treatment

. [....................................................................................................]

does decrease LDL-C levels and could therefore prevent ASCVD in
these patients, but it cannot stop the progression of liver damage.
Treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor may lead to an even greater overload of lysosomes. [385] Enzyme replacement therapy with sebelipase
alfa might offer a treatment solution in the near future. [386]

9.2 Women

Few randomized trials of statin therapy have reported independently
significant CV benefits in women, [387][,][389] chiefly because women have
not been adequately represented in statin trials.

9.2.1 Effects of statins in primary and secondary
prevention
There has previously been controversy over whether statins are
effective for primary prevention in women. Using published data, a
2013 Cochrane analysis showed that statin therapy reduced all-cause
mortality, vascular events, and revascularizations in primary prevention, and the proportional effects in women were similar to those in
men. [213] The CTT collaboration has provided a more complete
assessment of the evidence through a comprehensive analysis of IPD

from 22 trials of statins vs. control and five trials of more- vs. lessintensive statin therapy. [35] Overall, 46 675 (27%) of 174 149 participants were women, and after adjustment for non-gender differences,
the proportional reductions per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C in major


vascular events, major coronary events, coronary revascularization,
and stroke were similar in women and men. [35]

9.2.2 Non-statin lipid-lowering drugs
Definitive evidence of the cardioprotective effects of non-statin drugs

that lower LDL-C is now available, and the beneficial effects are similar in both women and men. In the IMPROVE-IT study, [33] the relative
benefit of adding ezetimibe to simvastatin was similar in women and
men. [33] In the ACCORD lipid study, there was no evidence that fenofibrate added to the effects of simvastatin in patients with T2DM, [306]

but an analysis of the FIELD study showed consistent CV event
reduction in both women and men. [389] Several outcome trials assess
ing the effects of adding a PCSK9 inhibitor to high-intensity statin
therapy have now been reported, with similar proportional reductions in major vascular events in women and men. [120][,][286][,][290]

9.2.3 Hormone therapy

�
Currently prescribed third-generation, low-dose oestrogen progestin
oral contraceptives do not appear to increase adverse coronary
events [390] and can be used, after baseline lipid profile assessment, in
women with acceptable TC levels. In contrast, alternative contraceptive measures should be recommended in women with hypercholesterolaemia [LDL-C >4 mmol/L (>160 mg/dL)] or with multiple risk
factors, and in those at high-risk of thrombotic events. [391] Oestrogen
replacement therapy, despite some favourable effects on lipid profiles,

has not been demonstrated to reduce CV risk and cannot be recommended for CVD prevention in women. [392] No lipid-lowering drugs
should be administered during pregnancy and the period of breastfeeding because data on possible adverse effects are lacking. However, bile
acid sequestrants may be considered.

Box 6 lists the main measures in the management of dyslipidaemia

in women.

ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; FH = familial hypercholesterolaemia; LDL = low-density lipoprotein.

9.3 Older people
The proportion of older people (defined herein as those aged >65
years) in society is increasing and, as a consequence, >80% of individuals who die from CVD are >65 years of age. The proportion of
patients with MI >85 years of age has increased several-fold. [393]

A meta-analysis of observational studies has shown that higher TC
is associated with increased CAD mortality at all ages. [62][,][394]

However, since the absolute risk of CAD is higher in older persons,

ESC/EAS Guidelines 153


the associated absolute increase in risk for a given increment in TC is
larger with increasing age. [217]

9.3.1 Effects of statins in primary and secondary
prevention
The use of statin therapy declines with increasing age, reflecting differences in both prescription and compliance. [395][,][396] This trend is
even more prominent among older patients who do not have evidence of occlusive vascular disease. [396] One explanation for this pattern may be uncertainty about the effects of statins in older people
due to the relatively small number of people aged >75 years who
have been included in statin trials. [233][,][397][,][398] The CTT collaboration

recently provided a comprehensive assessment of the randomized
evidence on the effects of statin therapy at different ages. [217] Among
186 854 participants in 28 trials, 14 483 (8%) were aged >75 years at
randomization. Overall, statin therapy produced a 21% relative
reduction in major vascular events (relative risk 0.79, 95% CI
0.77�0.81) per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, and there was direct
evidence of benefit among those aged >75 years. The relative reduction in major vascular events was similar, irrespective of age, among
patients with pre-existing vascular disease, but appeared smaller
among older individuals not known to have vascular disease.

Therefore, the available evidence from trials indicates that statin ther
apy produces significant reductions in major vascular events irrespective of age. However, there is less direct evidence of benefit among
patients aged >75 years who do not already have evidence of occlusive vascular disease, and this limitation is currently being addressed
by the STAtin therapy for Reducing Events in the Elderly (STAREE)

trial in Australia.

9.3.2 Adverse effects, interactions, and adherence

The safety and adverse effects of statins are a matter of special concern in older adults because they often have comorbidities, take multiple medications, and have altered pharmacokinetics and

�
pharmacodynamics. Statin drug interactions are a concern, primarily
because of their potential to increase muscle-related statin-associated adverse effects such as myalgia without CK elevation, myopathy
with CK elevation, and the rare but serious rhabdomyolysis. It is recommended that a statin is started at a low dose if there is significant
renal impairment and/or the potential for drug interactions, and then
titrated upwards to achieve LDL-C treatment goals.

9.4 Diabetes and metabolic syndrome
The number of people with DM will increase from �415 million
today up to 550 million by 2030, but the situation may get even
worse. [399] Despite significant advantages in the management strategies that lessen atherosclerotic CVD risk factors, CVD has remained
the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with T2DM.
The good news is that fatal CVD outcomes have declined significantly
in both T1DM and T2DM between 1998 and 2014. [400] DM itself is an

independent risk factor for CVD and is associated with a higher risk

of CVD, even more so in women. The difference in CVD risk

between individuals with and without DM has narrowed substantially
over the last few decades, [401] and there are strong associations
between DM and vascular outcomes. [402][,][403] Recent data indicate that

DM per se increases CVD risk about two-fold on average, but the risk
is subject to wide variation depending on the population and current
aggressive prophylactic therapy. [401][,][404] Importantly, those with DM
and CAD are at substantially higher CVD risk for future events. In
T2DM, the risk of ASCVD is strongly determined by the presence of
target organ damage—including nephropathy (microalbuminuria),
neuropathy, or retinopathy—with the risks increasing in relation to
the number of conditions present. [405] Hypertension, dyslipidaemia,
abdominal obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
commonly coexist with T2DM and further aggravate the risk, which
is highest in people with T2DM and multiple cardiometabolic risk
factors. [406][�][408] Importantly, DM confers excess mortality risk following ACS despite modern therapies, highlighting the poor prognosis of
coronary patients with T2DM and the need for intensive therapy. [409]

How to capture the extra risk beyond the traditional risk factors in
clinical practice is a debated issue. A practical approach is that if one
component is identified, a systematic search should be made for the
others. [410]

9.4.1 Specific features of dyslipidaemia in insulin
resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus
Diabetic dyslipidaemia is a cluster of plasma lipid and lipoprotein
abnormalities that are metabolically interrelated. The increase in
large VLDL particles in T2DM initiates a sequence of events that
generates atherogenic remnants, small dense LDL, and small TGrich dense HDL particles. [411] These components are not isolated
abnormalities but are closely linked to each other. Both LDL and
HDL particles show variable compositional changes that are
reflected in their functions. Notably, ApoC-III levels are increased
in people with T2DM. [412] High ApoC-III concentrations prevent

the clearance of both TRLs and remnants, resulting in prolonged
residence times of these particles in the circulation. [413][,][414] In fact,
the defective catabolism of TRLs seems to be a more important
contributor to the elevation of plasma TGs than the increased
production rate leading to an excess of remnant particles.
Together, TRL remnants, small dense LDL, and small dense HDL
comprise the atherogenic lipid profile, which is also characterized
by an increase in ApoB concentration due to an increased number
of ApoB-containing particles. Importantly, TRLs—including chylomicrons, VLDL, and their remnants—carry a single ApoB molecule, also like LDL particles. Therefore, the malignant nature of
diabetic dyslipidaemia is not always revealed by the lipid measures
used in clinical practice, as LDL-C levels may remain within the
normal range. It may be better revealed by non-HDL-C levels. [415]

Elevation of TGs or low HDL-C levels in the fasting or post-prandial state is seen in about one-half of all people with T2DM, [416][,][417]

and is also often present in people with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance or impaired glucose tolerance. [413]

low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; TG = triglyceride; TRLs = triglyceride-rich
lipoproteins.

9.4.2 Evidence for lipid-lowering therapy
9.4.2.1 Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. LDL-C is the primary target
of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with DM. Trials specifically performed in people with T2DM, as well as subsets of individuals with
DM in major statin trials, have consistently demonstrated significant
benefits of statin therapy on CVD events in people with T2DM. [418]

Statin therapy reduces the 5 year incidence of major CVD events by
23% per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, regardless of the initial LDLC level or other baseline characteristics based on meta-analysis. [418]

The CTT meta-analysis further indicates that people with T2DM will
have a relative risk reduction that is comparable to that seen in nondiabetic patients; however, being at higher absolute risk, the absolute
benefit will be greater, resulting in a lower number needed to treat
(NNT). Thus, statin therapy is the first-line treatment for LDL-C lowering and for the reduction of CVD burden. [419] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Ezetimibe lowers LDL-C by �24% and, when added to statin therapy, decreases the risk of major vascular events. [33] The relative risk
reduction in major vascular events is proportional to the absolute
degree of LDL-C lowering and consistent with the relationship seen
for statins. The subset of patients with DM in IMPROVE-IT had, as
expected, a higher rate of major vascular events than patients with
�
out DM (46 vs. 31% 7 year Kaplan Meier rate in the placebo arm).
Ezetimibe appeared particularly efficacious in patients with DM, with

�
a relative risk reduction of 15% (95% CI 6 22%) and an absolute risk
reduction of 5.5%. [299]

The mAb PCSK9 inhibitors evolocumab and alirocumab lower

LDL-C levels by �60% and, when added to statin therapy, decrease
the risk of major vascular events. [119] In the FOURIER study, the relative risk reduction for major vascular events was similar in patients
with and without DM; however, given the higher baseline risk in
patients with DM, the absolute risk reductions tended to be greater
in patients with DM (2.7% absolute decrease in major vascular events
over 3 years). [297] Of note, the achieved LDL-C in the evolocumab
arm was 0.8 mmol/L. The same benefits were also recently demonstrated for diabetic patients after ACS in the ODYSSEY trial. [420]

Recent studies have suggested an increased incidence of DM in
patients treated with statins. [247] These observations have been seen
in Mendelian randomization studies and in clinical trials, although the
effect appears greatest in patients already at high risk for DM (e.g.
those with pre-diabetes). These observations should not lessen our
attention to the treatment of patients, as the overall benefits in CV
event reduction remain and greatly outweigh the increased incidence

of DM. In RCTs, neither ezetimibe nor the PCSK9 inhibitors have
been reported to increase the risk of DM. [297]

9.4.2.2 Triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Lifestyle
modification provides the first option to improve atherogenic dyslipidaemia due to its multifaceted effects. Weight loss is, in most cases,
the most effective measure since it is associated with very pronounced effects on plasma TG and HDL levels, together with a modest decrease in TC and LDL-C levels. Moderate-to-heavy aerobic
exercise is also associated with improvement of the plasma lipid profile by reducing TG levels and increasing HDL-C concentrations. In
relation to diet composition, besides the need to eliminate trans fat,
the available evidence supports the reduction of saturated fat intake
and its substitution with unsaturated fat, as well as the replacement
of a major proportion of refined starchy foods and simple sugars with
fibre-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and wholegrains. [179]

The clinical benefits achieved by the treatment of high TG and low
HDL-C levels (frequently seen with DM) are still a matter of debate,
as the effects of fenofibrate therapy on the major outcome (MACE)
remained negative in both the FIELD and the ACCORD studies performed in T2DM cohorts. [306][,][307] In a post hoc analysis of the FIELD
study, fenofibrate reduced CVD events by 27% in those with elevated
TGs [�2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)] and increased HDL-C levels (NNT
= 23). [416] The ACCORD trial confirmed the following: patients who
had both TG levels in the higher third [�2.3 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)]
and an HDL-C level in the lower third [<_0.4 mmol/L (<_34 mg/dL)],
representing 17% of all participants, appeared to benefit from the
addition of fenofibrate to simvastatin. [306]

Recently, post-trial follow-up of the ACCORD lipid trial participants reported the beneficial effect of fenofibrate in people with


Elevation of TGs or low HDL-C levels in the fasting or post-prandial state is seen in about one-half of all people with T2DM, [416][,][417]

and is also often present in people with abdominal adiposity, insulin resistance or impaired glucose tolerance. [413]

HTG and low HDL-C levels at baseline. [421] Consistent with these

findings, a meta-analysis of fibrates in the prevention of CVD in
11590 people with T2DM showed that fibrates significantly reduced
the risk of non-fatal MI by 21%, but had no effect on the risk of overall
mortality or coronary mortality. [422] In CV outcome trials of fibrates,
the risk reduction has appeared to simply be proportional to the
degree of non-HDL-C lowering. [50]

Overall, available data indicate that diabetic patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia may derive clinical benefits from TG-lowering
therapy as an add-on to statin treatment. [354] The ongoing
PROMINENT trial is exploring the efficacy of pemafibrate, a new
selective PPAR-a modulator, in reducing CVD outcomes in �10 000
diabetic patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia on a statin. [317][,][423]

There are limited data on the impacts on CVD of adding omega-3
fatty acids to statin therapy in patients with high plasma TG levels

who are treated with statins. The REDUCE-IT trial examined the

effects of icosapent ethyl 2 g b.i.d. on CV events in 8179 high-risk
patients with HTG who were taking a statin. Over a median of 4.9
years, there was a significant (P < 0.001) 25% reduction in the composite primary outcome of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, cor- . [............................................................]
onary revascularization, or unstable angina, corresponding with an
absolute reduction of 4.8%, which was offset by a 1% increased absolute risk of hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or flutter. [194] The
STRENGTH trial is investigating the effect of omega-3 fatty acids, in

addition to a statin, in individuals with HTG and low HDL-C levels

who are at high-risk for CVD. The ASCEND trial was a randomized
2�2 factorial design study of aspirin and omega-3 fatty acid supplements for the primary prevention of CV events in people with DM,
but not specifically with HTG. Among 15 480 people randomized to
omega-3 fatty acid supplements vs. placebo over a mean follow-up of

�
7.4 years, there was no significant effect (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 1.08)
on serious vascular events [non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, transient
ischaemic attack (TIA), or vascular death]. [329][,][424][�][426]

9.4.3 Type 1 diabetes mellitus
T1DM is associated with high CVD risk, in particular in patients with
microalbuminuria and renal disease. [427] Conclusive evidence supports
the proposition that hyperglycaemia accelerates atherosclerosis.
Emerging evidence highlights the frequent coexistence of MetS with
T1DM, resulting in the so-called double diabetes increasing CVD risk. [428]

The lipid profile in T1DM patients with good glycaemic control is
‘supernormal’, and is characterized by subnormal TG and LDL-C levels, whereas HDL-C levels are usually within the upper normal range
or slightly elevated. This is explained by subcutaneous administration
of insulin that increases LPL activity in adipose tissue and skeletal
muscle, and consequently the turnover rate of VLDL particles. [429]

However, there are potentially atherogenic changes in the compositions of both HDL and LDL particles.

Consistent data have demonstrated the efficacy of statins in
preventing CV events and reducing CV mortality in patients with
DM, with no evidence of sex differences. [430][,][431] A meta-analysis
including 18 686 patients with DM demonstrated that a statininduced reduction of LDL-C yielded a 9% reduction in all-cause
mortality and a 21% reduction in the incidence of major CV events
per 1.0 mmol/L (40mg/dL) lower LDL cholesterol. [418] Similar


benefits were seen in patients with T1DM and T2DM. In diabetic
patients with ACS, intensive statin treatment led to a reduction in
all-cause mortality and CV death, and contributed to a reduction
in atheroma progression. [432]

9.4.4 Management of dyslipidaemia for pregnant women

with diabetes

In both T1DM and young-onset T2DM patients, there is a paucity of
evidence to indicate the age at which statin therapy should be initiated. To guide an approach, statins are not indicated in pregnancy, [433]

and should be avoided in both T1DM and T2DM individuals who are

planning pregnancy. If diabetic individuals aged <_30 years have no evidence of vascular damage and, in particular, microalbuminuria, it
seems reasonable to delay statin therapy in asymptomatic patients
until the age of 30. Below this age, statin therapy should be managed
on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the presence of microalbuminuria, end organ damage, and ambient LDL-C levels.

Recommendations for the treatment of dyslipidaemias in DM are

shown in the table below.

9.5 Patients with acute coronary
syndromes and patients undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention
Patients who present with ACS are at increased risk of experiencing
recurrent CV events. For these patients, lipid management should be
undertaken in the context of a comprehensive global risk reduction
strategy including lifestyle adaptations, risk factor management, and
the implementation of cardioprotective drug strategies. Ideally,
patients should be signed up to cardiac rehabilitation programmes to
enhance the control of lipid levels [434] and improve overall survival following ACS. [435] Despite the acknowledged clinical benefits of lowering LDL-C in patients with ACS, [436] attainment of LDL-C target
values remains suboptimal in this very high-risk setting. [437]

9.5.1 Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with acute
coronary syndromes
LDL-C levels tend to decrease during the first days of ACS and therefore a lipid profile should be obtained as soon as possible after admission for ACS. Patients do not have to be fasting as this has little
impact on LDL-C levels. [100] Lipid-lowering treatment should be initiated as early as possible to increase patient adherence after discharge. Lipid levels should be re-evaluated 4�6 weeks after ACS to
determine whether treatment goals have been achieved and to check
for any safety issues; the therapeutic regimen can then be adapted
accordingly.

9.5.1.1 Statins. Data from RCTs and meta-analyses indicate that routine early use of high-intensity statin therapy is associated with rapid
and sustained clinical benefits. [438][�][442] We recommend the initiation

of high-intensity statin therapy in all statin-naı¨ve ACS patients with no
contraindication, regardless of initial LDL-C values; the treatment
goal is to reach a 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline and an LDL-C
goal of <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL). In those with recurrent events
within 2 years while taking maximally tolerated statin therapy, a goal
of <1.0 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL) for LDL-C should be considered. The
intensity of statin therapy should be increased in those patients
receiving low- or moderate-intensity statin treatment at presentation, unless there is a definite history of intolerance to high-intensity
statin therapy. The use of lower-intensity statin therapy should be
considered in patients at increased risk of adverse effects with highintensity statin therapy, such as in the elderly, patients diagnosed with
hepatic or renal impairment, or in the case of a potential risk of

�
drug drug interactions with other essential concomitant therapies.

Regarding the timing of statin treatment initiation, the Statins
Evaluation in Coronary Procedures and Revascularization (SECUREPCI) randomized, placebo-controlled trial recently assessed the
impact of peri-procedural loading with atorvastatin [two loading
doses of 80 mg, before and 24 h after the planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)] on MACE at 30 days in 4191 patients with
ACS and planned invasive management. [443] All patients received atorvastatin 40 mg per day starting 24 h after the second loading dose.
The authors found no significant treatment benefit in the overall
study population. In a pre-specified analysis, a significant 28% relative
risk reduction in MACE was observed among patients who under
. [.........................................................................................................................................................................]


pronounced (46% relative risk reduction) in a post hoc analysis including 865 ST-elevation MI (STEMI) patients undergoing reperfusion by
primary PCI. [443] Based on current evidence, we recommend the initia
�
tion of high-intensity statin therapy during the first 1 4 days of hospitalization for the index ACS. [438][�][442] Moreover, pre-treatment (or
loading dose for patients already on a statin) with a high-intensity statin should be considered in ACS patients with planned invasive
management. [443]

9.5.1.2 Ezetimibe. In the IMPROVE-IT trial, the addition of ezetimibe

to simvastatin therapy provided an additional benefit (6.4% relative
risk reduction in the composite clinical endpoint) to post-ACS
patients. [33] The clinical benefit of adding ezetimibe was consistent
across patient subgroups [299][,][444] and also led to a reduction of total
CV events, [445] stroke, [446] and rehospitalizations. [447] Patients at higher
atherothrombotic risk [as assessed by the TIMI (Thrombolysis In
Myocardial Infarction) risk score for secondary prevention] benefitted the most from the addition of ezetimibe. [448] In another random
ized, open-label trial including 1734 patients with ACS, the addition
of ezetimibe to moderate-intensity statin (pitavastatin 2 mg) therapy
failed to improve outcomes overall, but did reduce the composite
primary endpoint (death, MI, stroke, unstable angina, and ischaemiadriven revascularization) during 3.9-year follow-up in patients with
increased intestinal absorption of cholesterol (as assessed by elevated levels of sitosterol) [449] ; however, this finding requires further

confirmation.

9.5.1.3 Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors. In the
FOURIER trial, which included 27 564 patients with atherosclerotic
CV disease, the addition of evolocumab to statin therapy (69% highintensity therapy) resulted in a 15% relative risk reduction of the
composite primary endpoint throughout a 2.2 year follow-up.
Results were consistent in the subgroup of patients with a history of
MI (81% of all patients). [119][,][450] A subanalysis of the FOURIER trial
showed that patients who achieved the lowest LDL-C values under
PCSK9 treatment also had the lowest risk of future MACE. [451] In the

ODYSSEY Outcomes trial, which included 18 924 patients with

�
recent ACS (1 12 months prior to enrolment, median 2.6 months),
alirocumab added to statin therapy (89% high-intensity therapy) also
resulted in a 15% relative risk reduction in the primary composite
endpoint and was associated with a 15% relative reduction in allcause mortality throughout a 2.8 year follow-up. [120] No serious side
effects or safety concerns were reported in these two large trials.
The optimal timing of initiating PCSK9 inhibition after ACS and its
impact on clinical outcomes remain to be determined. Regarding the
timing of PCSK9 inhibitor treatment initiation, post hoc analyses from

the FOURIER trial have shown that the closer to the event this is

done, the better. Treatment initiation with PCSK9 inhibitors during
the acute phase of ACS is under investigation in the EVOlocumab for
Early Reduction of LDL-cholesterol Levels in Patients With Acute
Coronary Syndromes (EVOPACS) trial. [452] Based on current evi
dence, we recommend the initiation of treatment with PCSK9 inhibi
tors in patients with ACS who do not reach their respective LDL-C
goals (as outlined in Table 7) after 4�6 weeks of maximum tolerated
statin and ezetimibe therapy. In patients who present with an ACS
and whose LDL-C levels are not at goal, despite already taking a

LDL-C levels tend to decrease during the first days of ACS and therefore a lipid profile should be obtained as soon as possible after admission for ACS. Patients do not have to be fasting as this has little
impact on LDL-C levels. [100] Lipid-lowering treatment should be initiated as early as possible to increase patient adherence after discharge. Lipid levels should be re-evaluated 4�6 weeks after ACS to
determine whether treatment goals have been achieved and to check
for any safety issues; the therapeutic regimen can then be adapted
accordingly.


9.5.1.1 Statins. Data from RCTs and meta-analyses indicate that routine early use of high-intensity statin therapy is associated with rapid
and sustained clinical benefits. [438][�][442] We recommend the initiation

of high-intensity statin therapy in all statin-naı¨ve ACS patients with no
contraindication, regardless of initial LDL-C values; the treatment
goal is to reach a 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline and an LDL-C
goal of <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL). In those with recurrent events
within 2 years while taking maximally tolerated statin therapy, a goal
of <1.0 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL) for LDL-C should be considered. The
intensity of statin therapy should be increased in those patients
receiving low- or moderate-intensity statin treatment at presentation, unless there is a definite history of intolerance to high-intensity
statin therapy. The use of lower-intensity statin therapy should be
considered in patients at increased risk of adverse effects with highintensity statin therapy, such as in the elderly, patients diagnosed with
hepatic or renal impairment, or in the case of a potential risk of

�
drug drug interactions with other essential concomitant therapies.

Regarding the timing of statin treatment initiation, the Statins
Evaluation in Coronary Procedures and Revascularization (SECUREPCI) randomized, placebo-controlled trial recently assessed the
impact of peri-procedural loading with atorvastatin [two loading
doses of 80 mg, before and 24 h after the planned percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)] on MACE at 30 days in 4191 patients with

The authors found no significant treatment benefit in the overall
study population. In a pre-specified analysis, a significant 28% relative
risk reduction in MACE was observed among patients who underwent PCI (65% of all patients). The benefit was even more

maximally tolerated statin dose and ezetimibe prior to the event,
the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor early after the event (during
the hospitalization for the ACS event if possible) should be

considered.

9.5.1.4 n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oral supplementation with
highly purified n-3 PUFAs reduced mortality in survivors of MI in one
study [Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Infarto
Miocardico-Prevenzione (GISSI-P)] but failed to affect clinical outcomes in subsequent trials using contemporary secondary prevention therapies. A recent meta-analysis of available RCTs showed no
reduction in mortality, MI, or major vascular events associated with
n-3 PUFAs, including the subgroup of patients with known CAD. [453]

Therefore, routine treatment with n-3 PUFAs cannot be

recommended.

9.5.1.5 Cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors. In 2007, a large prospective study using the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib failed to show
any clinical benefit in more than 15 000 high-risk patients, and was
potentially harmful. [336] The CETP inhibitors dalcetrapib (in >30 000
patients with recent ACS [65] ) and evacetrapib (in >12 000 high-risk
patients [63] ) were investigated in 2012 and 2017, respectively. Neither
clinical study was able to show any clinical benefit associated with
CETP inhibitors. [65] More recently, the REVEAL study investigated
anacetrapib in >30 000 patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease
and resulted in a lower incidence of MACE compared with placebo
after 4 years, with no safety concerns. [64] However, this compound
was not filed for marketing authorization.

9.5.2 Lipid-lowering therapy in patients undergoing
percutaneous coronary intervention
In a meta-analysis of 13 randomized studies including 3341
patients who were planned to undergo PCI, pre-treatment with a
high-dose statin (statin-naı¨ve patients, 11 studies) or a highdose statin loading dose reduced the risk of MACE (death, MI, or
target vessel revascularization) by 44% both for peri-procedural
MI and MACE at 30 days. [454] In all but one study, PCI was
performed in the setting of stable angina or in a non-emergency
setting in non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). One of the studies
that was included in the meta-analysis showed an improvement in
coronary flow when primary PCI was used for the treatment
of STEMI. [455] A routine strategy of either short pre-treatment
or loading (on the background of pre-existing therapy) with a
high-dose statin before PCI should be considered in elective
PCI or NSTE-ACS. [454][,][456][,][457]

In addition, pre-treatment with a statin has also been shown to
reduce the risk of contrast-induced acute kidney injury after coronary
angiography or intervention. [458]

and patients undergoing PCI are summarized below.

9.6 Stroke

Stroke has a heterogeneous aetiology, including cardiac thromboembolism [often associated with atrial fibrillation, but also of
uncertain source (embolic stroke of undetermined source)], carotid
artery and proximal aortic atherosclerosis and thromboembolism,
small-vessel CVD, and intracranial haemorrhage (including intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage). Dyslipidaemia may play a variable role in the pathogenesis of stroke according to the particular
aetiology. The relationship between dyslipidaemia and atherothrombotic events, including ischaemic stroke and TIA, is well recognized,
while the association of dyslipidaemia with other types of stroke is
uncertain. Notwithstanding, concomitant control of other aetiological factors, such as hypertension, is of paramount importance.
Following ischaemic stroke or TIA, patients are at risk not only of
recurrent cerebrovascular events, but also of other major CV events,
including MI. Secondary prevention therapy with statins reduces the
risk of recurrent stroke (by 12% per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol), MI, and vascular death. [459][,][460] Statin pre-treatment at TIA
onset was associated with reduced recurrent early stroke risk in
patients with carotid stenosis in a pooled data analysis, supporting asearly-as-possible initiation of statins after stroke. [460][�][462] Statin therapy may yield a small increase in the risk of haemorrhagic stroke, but
the evidence regarding this risk is uncertain. [34][,][36][,][251][,][252]

9.7 Heart failure and valvular diseases

9.7.1 Prevention of incident heart failure in coronary
artery disease patients
Cholesterol lowering with statins reduces the incidence of HF in
patients with CAD (stable CAD or a history of ACS) without previous
HF; this has been shown consistently in RCTs that have compared statin vs. no statin treatment [463][,][464] as well as more-intensive vs. lessintensive statin therapy. [465][�][468] A large-scale meta-analysis of primary
and secondary prevention RCTs with statins showed a modest (10%)
reduction in first non-fatal HF hospitalizations with statin treatment,
with no effect on HF death within the limited RCT period. [469] There is
no evidence that statins can prevent HF of non-ischaemic origin.

9.7.2 Chronic heart failure
Two large RCTs [466][,][470] (mainly including patients with systolic HF), as
well as a meta-analysis of 24 RCTs, have shown no benefit of statin

[471] a reduction in HF . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


hospitalizations, [218][,][471] as well as a small reduction in MI, was
observed in a pooled analysis of the Controlled Rosuvastatin
Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA) and GISSI-HF trials. [472] Based on current evidence, routine administration of statins in

patients with HF without other indications for their use (e.g. CAD) is
not recommended. Because there is no evidence of harm in patients

on statin treatment after the occurrence of HF, there is no need for

statin discontinuation for patients already on treatment.

There is no evidence regarding the effect of PCSK9 inhibition in
patients with chronic HF. In the recent PCSK9 clinical outcomes trials, FOURIER [119] and ODYSSEY Outcomes, [120] PCSK9 inhibition in

patients with atherosclerotic CVD or after an ACS did not reduce
the risk of HF hospitalization. In the BIOlogy Study to TAilored
Treatment in Chronic Heart Failure (BIOSTAT-CHF) study of 2174
patients with worsening HF, multivariable analysis revealed a positive
linear association between PCSK9 levels and the risk of mortality,
and the composite of mortality and unplanned HF hospitalization. [473]

Similarly, there was a negative association between LDLR levels and
mortality, indicating a potential relationship between the
PCSK9�LDLR axis and outcomes among patients with HF that
requires further investigation. [473][,][474]

Treatment with n-3 PUFAs 1 g o.d. may confer a small benefit in
patients with chronic HF, as shown by a significant 9% relative risk
reduction for mortality in the GISSI-HF RCT. [475]

9.7.3 Valvular heart diseases

Aortic stenosis increases the risk of CV events and mortality, and frequently coexists with atherosclerotic CVD. Life-long high levels of
LDL-C [476] and Lp(a) [477] have been associated with incident aortic
valve stenosis and aortic valve calcification in genetic Mendelian randomization studies. Observational studies have suggested possible
beneficial effects of intensive lipid lowering in slowing the progression
of native valve aortic stenosis. [478] However, this has not been confirmed in RCTs, [266][,][479][�][481] or in meta-analyses of observational and
randomized trials. [482][,][483] Three modestly sized trials [479][�][481] and one
large randomized trial (SEAS, which included 1873 patients treated
with simvastatin 40 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg or placebo) [266] failed to
show a reduction in the clinical progression of aortic stenosis in
patients with mild-to-moderate native valve aortic stenosis. In a post
hoc analysis of the SEAS trial, the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy in
impeding the progression of aortic stenosis increased with higher
pre-treatment LDL-C levels and lower peak aortic jet velocity (i.e.
milder stenosis at baseline). [484] Similarly, a post hoc analysis of three
RCTs, including patients without known aortic valve stenosis at baseline [Treating to New Targets (TNT), Incremental Decrease In Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid-lowering (IDEAL), and Stroke
Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels
(SPARCL)] showed no impact of high-dose vs. usual-dose statin therapy on the incidence of aortic valve stenosis. [485] In patients who
underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement, statin therapy
was associated with improved outcomes in a small observational
study. [486]

Aortic valve sclerosis (calcification of the aortic leaflets without significant transvalvular pressure gradient) is associated with an increased
risk of CAD even in the absence of increased risk profiles. Whether or
not statins may be useful both for aortic valve disease and CAD progression in such patients warrants further investigation. [487]

9.8 Chronic kidney disease
CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present
for >3 months, with implications for health. CKD is classified on the
basis of the cause, GFR category, and category of albuminuria. [488] In the
adult population, decreasing GFR is associated with increased CVD risk,
independent of other CV risk factors. [489][�][492] There is an increased risk
of both atherosclerotic vascular disease and structural heart disease. [492]

Patients with CKD and established CVD have a much higher mortality
rate compared with patients with CVD and normal renal function. [493]

Therefore, patients with CKD are considered to be at high (stage 3
CKD) or very-high risk (stage 4�5 CKD or on dialysis) of CVD, and . [.............................................................................................]


whether statin therapy is effective in more advanced CKD, particularly
dialysis patients. By combining data from the three CKD trials with
other trials in the existing database, the CTT investigators found that,
even after adjusting for the smaller LDL-C reductions achieved among
patients with more advanced CKD and for differences in outcome definitions between dialysis trials, there was a trend towards smaller relative
reductions per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C in major atherosclerotic
events as estimated GFR (eGFR) declines (with little evidence of benefit
among dialysis patients). [214] This diminution in relative risk reduction as
GFR declines implies that, at least in non-dialysis patients, more intensive
LDL-lowering regimens are required to achieve the same benefit.

9.8.3 Safety of lipid management in patients with chronic
kidney disease
Safety issues and dose adjustments are important in advanced stages

�
of CKD (stages 3 5), as adverse events are commonly dose-related
and due to increased blood concentrations of compounds. Although
it has been suggested that preference should be given to regimens

and doses that have been shown to be beneficial in RCTs conducted
specifically in such patients, [494] the CTT meta-analysis makes clear
that the goal—as in patients without CKD—should be to achieve the
largest possible absolute reduction in LDL-C safely. Although there
were no specific safety concerns raised by the 4D, AURORA, or
SHARP trials, statins metabolized via CYP3A4 may result in adverse

�
effects due to drug drug interactions and caution is required.

Based on the evidence for lipid management in patients with CKD,
the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization has developed an updated clinical practice guideline for lipid
management in CKD. [494] In line with this, but with a focus on those
patients at high or very-high risk for developing CVD, recommenda
tions are summarized below.

9.8 Chronic kidney disease
CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present
for >3 months, with implications for health. CKD is classified on the
basis of the cause, GFR category, and category of albuminuria. [488] In the
adult population, decreasing GFR is associated with increased CVD risk,
independent of other CV risk factors. [489][�][492] There is an increased risk
of both atherosclerotic vascular disease and structural heart disease. [492]

Patients with CKD and established CVD have a much higher mortality
rate compared with patients with CVD and normal renal function. [493]

Therefore, patients with CKD are considered to be at high (stage 3

�
CKD) or very-high risk (stage 4 5 CKD or on dialysis) of CVD, and
there is no need to use risk estimation models in these patients.


9.8.1 Lipoprotein profile in chronic kidney disease
In the initial stages of CKD, TG levels are specifically elevated and
HDL-C levels are lowered. LDL subclasses display a shift to an excess
of small dense LDL particles. Studies suggest that the kidney has a
role in Lp(a) catabolism and that Lp(a) levels are increased in association with kidney disease. Such acquired abnormalities can be reversed
by kidney transplantation or remission of nephrosis.

9.8.2 Evidence for risk reduction through statin-based
therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease
In the Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie (4D) trial, which involved
1200 patients with diabetes on haemodialysis, atorvastatin had no significant effect on risk of CVD. [220] Similar results were obtained in the

AURORA (A study to evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in subjects
On Regular haemodialysis: an Assessment of survival and cardiovascular events) trial, which involved 2776 patients on haemodialysis. [221]

In the SHARP study, [222] simvastatin and ezetimibe combination therapy reduced the risk for major atherosclerotic events (coronary death,
MI, non-haemorrhagic stroke, or any revascularization) compared with
placebo in persons with CKD stage 3A�5. The trial did not have sufficient power to separately assess the effects on the primary outcome in
dialysis and non-dialysis patients. Although statin-based therapy is clearly
effective in mild-to-moderate CKD, a major controversy that remained
after the publication of the 4D, AURORA, and SHARP studies was

9.9 Transplantation
Dyslipidaemias are very common in patients who have undergone
heart, lung, liver, kidney, or allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and predispose such patients to an increased risk of developing ASCVD and transplant arterial vasculopathy. [497][�][501] In patients
with CKD undergoing renal transplantation, the risk of ASCVD may
be determined, at least in part, by the increased risk resulting from

CKD itself.

Immunosuppressive drug regimens may have adverse effects on
lipid metabolism leading to increases in TC, VLDL, and TGs, and in
the size and density of LDL particles. These effects vary with different
immunosuppressive drugs. [497][,][498][,][502][�][506]

The management of dyslipidaemias in transplant recipients is comparable to what is recommended for patients at high or very high
ASCVD risk, although more attention is needed regarding the causes

�
of the lipid disturbances and possible side effects due to drug drug
interactions (see Recommendations for low-density lipoprotein in solid
organ transplant patients below).
The clinical effectiveness of statins in renal transplant patients
is uncertain owing to a lack of randomized trials in this population.
A systematic review of the benefits and harms of statins in
patients with a functioning kidney transplant included 3465
patients, free of CHD, from 22 studies. Although the authors concluded that statins may reduce CV events, they also suggested a
need for additional studies. [253] However, in patients with a functioning renal transplant at increased risk of CVD, it may be appropriate
to extrapolate from the clear evidence of benefit from statin therapy, without safety concerns, in people with moderate reductions
in GFR. [214]

Several potential drug interactions must also be considered, especially with ciclosporin, which is metabolized through CYP3A4, and
may increase systemic statin exposure and the risk of myopathy.
Ciclosporin increases the blood levels of all statins.
Fluvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin are metabolized through different CYP enzymes than the others and have less
potential for interaction. [507]

Tacrolimus is also metabolized by CYP3A4, but appears to have
less potential for harmful interaction with statins than ciclosporin.
Other drugs that influence CYP3A4 activity should be avoided if possible, and used with extreme caution in patients receiving both calci
neurin inhibitors and statins.

For transplant patients with dyslipidaemia, ezetimibe could be considered as an alternative for patients unable to take a statin or added
to the highest tolerated statin dose. [507][�][509] No outcome data are
available for this drug, which should generally be reserved for
second-line use. Ciclosporin can induce a 2�12-fold increase in the

ezetimibe level.

Care is required with the use of fibrates, as they can decrease
ciclosporin levels and have the potential to cause myopathy.
Extreme caution is required if fibrate therapy is planned in combination with a statin. Cholestyramine is not effective as monotherapy in heart transplant patients and has the potential to reduce
absorption of immunosuppressants; this potential is minimized by
separate administration.

9.10 Peripheral arterial disease
PAD encompasses all vascular sites, including carotid, vertebral, upper
extremity, mesenteric, renal, and lower extremity arteries. The aorta
is often included in the term. [510] PAD is a common manifestation of

atherosclerosis and such patients are at elevated risk of coronary
events, with PAD representing an independent risk factor for MI and
CV death. [510][,][511] Patients with PAD are at very-high risk and should be
managed according to the recommendations in Table 7. Elevated CV
risk has led to the inclusion of PAD among the list of ‘risk equivalent’
conditions, and therapeutic strategies of secondary prevention should
be implemented [see Recommendations for lipid-lowering drugs in patients
with peripheral arterial disease (including carotid artery disease) below].
Yet, despite the high CV morbidity and mortality risk, PAD patients
are usually inadequately managed compared with CAD patients. [511]

9.10.1 Lower extremity arterial disease
A low ABI (0.90) is diagnostic for lower extremity arterial disease
(LEAD). Either a low (0.90) or high (1.40, related to stiffened arteries)
ABI is predictive of CV morbidity and mortality. Lowering LDL-C levels reduces the risk of ischaemic CV events and worsening of claudication, while it also improves walking performance. As for cardiac
events, a systematic review of 18 trials including 10 000 patients, with
cholesterol levels ranging from normal to elevated, reported that
lipid-lowering therapy in people affected by atherosclerosis of the

lower limbs was associated with a 20% reduction in total CV events,

together with a non-significant 14% reduction of all-cause mortality. [512] In the Heart Protection Study, the need for non-coronary
revascularization was reduced by 16% with statin therapy. [513]

In addition to statins, PSCK9 inhibitors have also been shown to

reduce CV events in PAD patients. In a pre-specified subgroup analysis of the FOURIER trial, evolocumab significantly reduced the primary endpoint in patients with PAD. [514] PAD had larger absolute risk
reductions for the primary endpoint (3.5% with PAD and 1.6% without PAD). Evolocumab also reduced the risk of major adverse limb
events by 42% in patients, with consistent effects in those with and

without known PAD. In the FIELD trial, fenofibrate reduced the risk

of amputations, particularly minor amputations without known largevessel disease, probably through non-lipid mechanisms. [515]

ESC/EAS Guidelines 161


9.10.2 Carotid artery disease
While there are currently no randomized studies that have assessed
whether lipid-lowering treatments reduce the incidence of CV events
in patients enrolled on the basis of carotid atherosclerotic disease
and without previous CV events, lipid-lowering therapy had
reduced stroke in numerous studies. In a meta-analysis of RCTs
enrolling >90 000 patients, statin therapy did lead to a 21% reduction
in the incidence of all strokes in different populations; this effect was
mainly driven by the extent of LDL-C reduction. [460]

9.10.3 Retinal vascular disease

Atherosclerotic changes of retinal arteries correlate with TC, LDL-C,
TG, and apoB levels and also with CAD. [516] Fenofibrate reduces the
progression of diabetic retinopathy. [517][,][518]

9.10.4 Secondary prevention in patients with abdominal
aortic aneurysm
The presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm represents a riskequivalent condition for CAD and is associated with age, male gender,
personal history of atherosclerotic CVD, smoking, hypertension, and
dyslipidaemia; [519] in contrast, diabetic patients are at decreased risk.

There are currently no available clinical trials on the reduction of CV
risk with lipid-lowering therapy in patients affected by this condition.
Systematic reviews, [520] mostly based on retrospective non-randomized
studies, have reported that there is still inconclusive evidence that statin therapy reduces peri-operative CV morbidity and mortality. In an
RCT comparing atorvastatin 20 mg with placebo, the composite endpoint of cardiac death, MI, stroke, and unstable angina was significantly
reduced in 100 patients undergoing vascular non-cardiac surgery,
including abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. [521] In another double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial in 497 patients undergoing vascular surgery,
peri-operative fluvastatin therapy (80 mg/day) was associated with an
improvement in post-operative cardiac outcome. [522]

9.10.5 Renovascular atherosclerosis

Lipid-lowering therapy has never been tested in an RCT in patients
affected by renovascular atherosclerosis; however, a recent nonrandomized population-based study showed that in patients older
than 65 years of age with atherosclerotic renovascular disease raised
the hypothesis that such treatment may yield cardiorenal benefits;
the risk of a major cardiorenal composite endpoint (MI, stroke, HF,
acute renal failure, dialysis, and death) was significantly lower in statin
users than in non-users. [523]

9.11 Other special populations at risk of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease

In general, the effects of lowering LDL-C are determined by the abso
lute risk of ASCVD and the achieved reduction in LDL-C, so it is

important to identify and treat all those at increased risk of ASCVD.
There are a few specific groups of patients in whom an underlying dis
ease confers such increased risk, and in addition in whom the stand
ard treatments may themselves cause dyslipidaemia that may
contribute to the risk of ASCVD. These include: (i) chronic immunemediated inflammatory disease, (ii) patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and (iii) patients with severe mental illness. The
management principles are the same in these patient groups, but their
management may need to address specific issues related to individual
dyslipidaemias and drug safety. Details are provided in the

### 10 Inflammation

Recent advances in basic science have established a fundamental role

for low-degree chronic inflammation in mediating all stages of atherosclerosis, from initiation through progression and, ultimately, to the
rupture of plaque and ensuing thrombotic complications of atherosclerosis. The cellular and molecular interactions involved during atherogenesis are fundamentally not different from those in chronic

�
inflammatory fibroproliferative diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis
(RA), glomerulosclerosis, or pulmonary fibrosis. [525] Almost all cell types
of the immuno-inflammatory system, such as macrophages, and T- and
B-cells, as well as many pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, have been identified during the process of atherosclerosis. [526]

Interestingly, cholesterol accumulation in cells triggers the inflammasome response and results in the production of inflammatory
mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1b. Numerous animal studies, using

the knockout model, have demonstrated that inflammation and the
immune system both play crucial roles during atherogenesis. [527]

During inflammatory processes, large numbers of acute-phase
proteins have been identified, and several clinical studies have
reported C-reactive protein [528] to be the most useful serum marker
of inflammation, even though it has poor specificity for any particular
inflammation process, including atherosclerosis. The high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein diagnostic test was developed to detect very low
levels of C-reactive protein, and thereby enable a more accurate and
precise measure of chronic inflammation compared with standard Creactive protein. [529] This diagnostic tool differs only in the range of Creactive protein levels that it can detect. Several studies have found
that elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in the blood

are associated with an increased risk of CV events and could be used

to predict clinical outcomes independently of cholesterol levels. [530][,][531] Other studies have not been able to show any relationship
between low-grade chronic inflammation, as indicated by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, and increased risk of CV. [532][�][535]

Finally, genetic studies of large population cohorts have not demonstrated that chronic elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
increases the risk of atherosclerotic events. [536] Nevertheless, in some

guidelines, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein has been added to traditional risk factors for prognostic information, especially for patients
at intermediate risk. [537][,][538]


9.10.3 Retinal vascular disease

Atherosclerotic changes of retinal arteries correlate with TC, LDL-C,
TG, and apoB levels and also with CAD. [516] Fenofibrate reduces the
progression of diabetic retinopathy. [517][,][518]


9.10.4 Secondary prevention in patients with abdominal
aortic aneurysm
The presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm represents a riskequivalent condition for CAD and is associated with age, male gender,
personal history of atherosclerotic CVD, smoking, hypertension, and
dyslipidaemia; [519] in contrast, diabetic patients are at decreased risk.

There are currently no available clinical trials on the reduction of CV
risk with lipid-lowering therapy in patients affected by this condition.
Systematic reviews, [520] mostly based on retrospective non-randomized
studies, have reported that there is still inconclusive evidence that statin therapy reduces peri-operative CV morbidity and mortality. In an
RCT comparing atorvastatin 20 mg with placebo, the composite endpoint of cardiac death, MI, stroke, and unstable angina was significantly

including abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. [521] In another double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial in 497 patients undergoing vascular surgery,
peri-operative fluvastatin therapy (80 mg/day) was associated with an
improvement in post-operative cardiac outcome. [522]

Statins have been shown to reduce C-reactive protein secretion
by hepatocytes, [539] and a series of clinical trials and post hoc analyses
have found that beneficial outcomes after statin therapy relate both
to a reduction in cholesterol levels and reduced inflammation. [540][�][544]

The Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention
Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial [542] demonstrated that in
primary prevention for individuals with chronically elevated C-reactive protein (>2 mg/L), statin treatment markedly reduced CV
events. [545] It is of note that other lipid-lowering agents, such as ezetimibe and more recently the anti-PCSK9 mAbs, do not influence highsensitivity C-reactive protein levels, [546][,][547] but lead to further significant reductions in CV events when added to statin therapy.

Specific anti-inflammatory treatment was tested in the
Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study
(CANTOS) trial. [548] In patients with previous MI and chronic elevated
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, all on optimal medical treatment, including statins, the anti-IL-1b mAb canakinumab dosedependently reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and significantly lowered the rate of recurrent CV events compared with placebo, independently of the level of lipid lowering. Not surprisingly,
there was a slight increase in the risk of severe and fatal infections associated with canakinumab. This study was the first to highlight the positive correlation between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and CV
events, where lower achieved high-sensitivity C-reactive protein values
were directly correlated with a lower risk of future CV events. [548]

Nevertheless, the FDA declined to approve canakinumab for CV risk
reduction on the strength of data from the CANTOS study. As canakinumab treatment has not been tested against anti-PCSK9 mAb and/or
ezetimibe added to statin therapy, the question of residual risk remains
for patients with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein despite
achieving very low (below goal) LDL-C values, and whether patients
with very low LDL-C would benefit from anti-IL-1b treatment or
other anti-inflammatory agents. In addition, all currently recommended
lipid-lowering drugs, including anti-PCSK9 mAbs, have demonstrated
beneficial effects on atherosclerotic plaque composition as well as plaque volume regression; such results are still missing for antiinflammatory treatment. Another anti-inflammatory approach using

methotrexate was tested in the Cardiovascular Inflammation
Reduction Trial (CIRT). [549] Very low-dose methotrexate (10 mg
weekly), a proven anti-inflammatory regimen that reduces tumour
necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, and C-reactive protein levels and is widely
used in the treatment of RA, was allocated vs. placebo to 7000 stable
CAD patients. This study was stopped prematurely due to futility.
Interestingly, this regimen of methotrexate had no effect on either IL-6
or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein blood levels in this population,
which could explain the neutral results of this trial. [550] Based on the cur
rent level of evidence, no further recommendations on the use of antiinflammatory agents can be made. [551]
### 11 Monitoring of lipids and enzymes in patients on lipid-lowering therapy

Evidence concerning which tests should be carried out to monitor

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


applies to tests of possible toxicity, such as ALT and CK.

Recommendations stem from consensus rather than evidence-based

medicine.

Response to therapy can be assessed at 6�8 weeks from initiation
of therapy, but response to lifestyle may take longer. Standard prac
�
tice for subsequent follow-up monitoring is 6 12 months, but such
monitoring intervals are arbitrary. As a minimum, LDL-C should be
assessed whenever available, but better management decisions will
probably occur if a full lipid profile is performed, including HDL-C
and TGs. Non-HDL-C or ApoB should also be analysed, and used as
a secondary treatment target. A separate issue is the impact of regular lipid monitoring in promoting patient adherence to lifestyle
changes or drug regimens that impact positively on their health, as
found in a range of studies. It is unclear whether only the process of
monitoring is critical in achieving this or whether a combination of
education, regular contact, and adherence assessment is required.
Where pharmacological lipid-lowering therapy is implemented,
safety blood tests are advised, including ALT and CK at baseline, to
identify the limited number of patients where treatment is contraindicated. CK should be checked in patients at high-risk for myopathy,
such as the very elderly with comorbidities, patients with antecedents
of muscle symptoms, or patients receiving interacting drugs. A mild
and typically transient elevation of ALT is seen in about 2% of patients
and normalization is seen with continuing therapy. [240][,][244][,][552] Recent
reviews are encouraging regarding the safety of long-term statin therapy and statin-induced liver injury is reported to be very
uncommon. [243][,][244][,][553][�][555] ALT is recommended before the start of

statin therapy; routine control of ALT during treatment is not recommended but should be performed, if indicated, based on clinical
observations. During fibrate therapy, regular ALT control is still recommended. In patients whose liver function tests increase to above
three times the ULN, explanations such as alcohol ingestion or
NAFLD should be sought, and the levels monitored. If levels remain
elevated then lipid-lowering therapy should be stopped, but may be
cautiously reintroduced under monitoring after levels have returned

to normal.

There is no predictive value of routine repeat CK testing for rhabdomyolysis since the level can increase for many reasons, including
muscle injury or excess muscular exercise. However, CK must be
assessed immediately in patients who present with muscle pain and
weakness, and especially in the elderly, and treatment stopped if CK
rises to >10 times the ULN. Strategies to handle CK elevations are
given in Table 13.
Due to the increased frequency of DM during statin treatment, [247][,][249][,][556][,][557] regular checks of HbA1c should be considered in
patients at high-risk of developing DM and under high-dose statin
treatment. Groups to be considered for glucose control are the elderly or those with MetS, obesity, or signs of insulin resistance.

increasing obesity, and diabetes [560][�][563] are the main contributors.
CVD cost the European Union about e210 billion in 2015, one-half
of which was in healthcare costs (�8% of total healthcare expenditure), and the other half in productivity losses and informal care. [558]

In these Guidelines, the Joint Task Force recommends a range of
actions to reduce CVD by targeting plasma lipids, ranging from
population-wide initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles to individuallevel interventions to reduce CVD risk factors, such as unhealthy
diets and high lipid levels. Cost-effectiveness analysis can help target
resources for interventions where the net health gain is greatest in
relation to the net resources, and is increasingly required across
Europe. [564] However, cost-effectiveness depends on available resources, the costs of services, and disease risk in the population, and
results obtained in one country might not be valid in another. [565] In
addition, to fully capture the long-term effects of interventions, costeffectiveness studies combining evidence from RCTs with modelling
and limitations in both could affect the reliability of findings. Here, the
evidence for the cost-effectiveness of ASCVD preventive interventions with respect to lipid modification is summarized; further scrutiny in view of local circumstances is recommended.

The health impact pyramid summarizes the evidence on the relative effort in relation to health impact (Figure 5), with interventions
with the broadest impact on populations at the base and interventions requiring considerable individual effort at the top. [566] There is
consensus that all the levels of the pyramid should be targeted but
that emphasis should be placed on the lower levels. This would
address the persistent socio-economic divide in CV health despite
major improvements in ASCVD treatment. [558]

More than one-half of the reduction in CV mortality over the
last three decades has been attributed to population-level changes

address the persistent socio-economic divide in CV health despite
major improvements in ASCVD treatment. [558]

More than one-half of the reduction in CV mortality over the
last three decades has been attributed to population-level changes


in CV risk factors, primarily reductions in plasma cholesterol, BP
levels, and smoking. [560][�][563][,][567] Lifestyle changes at the population
level may be more cost-effective than lifestyle and drug interventions at the individual level, particularly when targeted to populations at increased risk. Awareness and knowledge of how lifestyle

risk factors lead to CVD has increased in recent decades.

Moreover, legislation promoting a healthy lifestyle, such as
reduced salt intake and smoking bans, has been reported to be
cost-effective in preventing CVD, [568][�][573] and initiatives to
improve infrastructure and promote physical activity have shown
promise. [574][,][575] A number of structural strategies at international,
national, and regional levels combined can substantially reduce
CVD morbidity and mortality. [576][,][577] Individual-level interventions
to improve diet, [578][,][579] increase physical activity, [580] and
stop smoking [581] could also be cost-effective. [582] However, suboptimal adherence limits benefits, [583][,][584] and interventions to

improve adherence, such as electronic device reminders to reinforce favourable health behaviours, are increasingly being
investigated. [585]

All statin regimens and ezetimibe are now generically available
across Europe. There is strong evidence that lowering blood cholesterol levels using low-cost statins is widely cost-effective [586][�][590] in
many categories of patients. For secondary prevention of CVD, the
evidence suggests that statin treatments are highly cost-effective, [586][,][590][,][591] and adding low-cost ezetimibe to high-intensity statin
therapy further reduces LDL-C and CVD risk cost-effectively. [592] In
primary ASCVD prevention, the evidence indicates that generic
statin-based treatments are cost-effective for people at least down to

1% annual total CVD risk and could be cost-effective at even lower
risk, [589] with the highest tolerated statin dose likely the most costeffective. [591][,][593][,][594] Importantly, many patients on statin treatment fail
to take their medications adequately and/or to reach their therapeutic goals, [595] with clinical and economic consequences. [596][,][597]

Reinforcing measures aimed at improving adherence to treatment is
cost-effective. [598][�][600]

Studies have shown that at mid-2018 prices PCSK9 inhibitors
were largely not cost-effective. [601][�][604] Their cost-effectiveness is
improved in selected high-risk patients, such as those with clinical
CVD or FH, other comorbidities, and high LDL-C levels. [605][,][606]

However, at lower prices, PCSK9 inhibitors would become costeffective in a wider range of high-risk patients; recent price reductions
may therefore lead to increased use. [607] Cost-effectiveness evidence
for other lipid-modifying therapies is lacking.

Effective interventions to prevent ASCVD, including statins, typically exhibit similar relative risk reductions across categories of
patients, including by ASCVD risk; therefore, health benefits and
cost-effectiveness are greater among people at higher ASCVD risk
(Figure 6). [36][,][233] Consequently, increased efforts and higher-intensity
interventions should be aimed at individuals and populations at higher

ASCVD risk.

### 13 Strategies to encourage adoption of healthy lifestyle changes and adherence to lipid- modifying therapies

Helping patients to change to healthier lifestyle habits is most effectively achieved through formal programmes of preventive care, possibly because of the intensive follow-up and multidisciplinary expertise
they provide. [608] However, in everyday care, adherence to both
healthy lifestyle changes and medication regimens is a challenge to
patients and professionals.

A comprehensive patient- and family-centred approach located in
one healthcare setting is recommended rather than addressing single

risk factors with more than one intervention in different locations.

Box 10 includes some useful techniques when counselling patients for
behavioural change.

### 14 Key messages

(1) Cholesterol and risk. Prospective studies, randomized trials,

and Mendelian randomization studies have all shown that raised

LDL-C is a cause of ASCVD. Throughout the range of LDL-C lev
els, ‘lower is better’ with no lower threshold, at least down to �1

mmol/L. Lowering LDL-C may yield worthwhile benefits in

patients with average or below average LDL-C who are already

receiving LDL-C-lowering treatment. The proportional reduction

in ASCVD risk achieved by lowering LDL-C (e.g. with a statin, eze
timibe, or PCSK9-inhibitor) depends on the absolute reduction in

LDL-C, with each 1 mmol/L reduction corresponding to a reduc
tion of about one-fifth in ASCVD.

(2) PCSK-9 inhibitors. Large trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibi
tors further reduce ASCVD risk when given on top of statin-based

therapy and their use may need to be restricted to those at the

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


(3) Use of cardiac imaging for risk stratification. CAC score

assessment with CT may be helpful in reaching decisions about

treatment in people who are at moderate risk of ASCVD.

Obtaining such a score may assist in discussions about treatment

strategies in patients where the LDL-C goal is not achieved with

lifestyle intervention alone and there is a question of whether to

institute LDL-C-lowering treatment. Assessment of arterial (caro
tid or femoral) plaque burden on ultrasonography may also be

informative in these circumstances.

(4) Use of ApoB in risk stratification. ApoB may be a better

measure of an individual’s exposure to pro atherogenic lipopro
teins, and hence its use may be particularly helpful for risk assess
ment in people where measurement of LDL-C underestimates

this burden, such as those with high TG, DM, obesity, or very low

LDL-C.

(5) Use of Lp(a) in risk stratification. A one-off measurement of

Lp(a) may help to identify people with very high inherited Lp(a)

levels who may have a substantial lifetime risk of ASCVD. A high

Lp(a) plasma level may also be helpful in further risk stratification

of patients at high risk of ASCVD, in patients with a family history

of premature CVD, and to determine treatment strategies in peo
ple whose estimated risk is on the border of risk categories.

(6) Intensification of treatment goals. It is important to ensure

that treatment of the highest-risk patients achieves the largest

LDL-C reduction possible. These Guidelines aim to support this

by setting both a minimum percentage LDL-C reduction (50%)

and an absolute LDL-C treatment goal of <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/

dL) for very-high-risk patients, and <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) for

high-risk patients. It is recommended that FH patients with

ASCVD or who have another major risk factor are treated as

very-high-risk, and those with no prior ASCVD or other risk fac
tors as high-risk.

(7) Treatment of patients with recent ACS. New randomized

trials support a strategy of intensification of LDL-C-lowering ther
apy in very-high-risk patients with ACS (MI or unstable angina). If

the specified LDL-C treatment goal is not achieved after 4�6

weeks with the highest tolerated statin dose and ezetimibe, it is

appropriate to add a PCSK9 inhibitor.

(8) Safety of low LDL cholesterol concentrations. To date

there are no known adverse effects of very low LDL-C concentra
tions [e.g. <1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL)].

(9) Management of statin ‘intolerance’. While statins rarely

cause serious muscle damage (myopathy, or rhabdomyolysis in the

most severe cases), there is much public concern that statins may

commonly cause less serious muscle symptoms. Such statin ‘intol
erance’ is frequently encountered by practitioners and may be diffi
cult to manage. However, placebo-controlled randomized trials

have shown very clearly that true statin intolerance is rare, and

that it is generally possible to institute some form of statin therapy

(e.g. by changing the statin or reducing the dose) in the over
whelming majority of patients at risk of ASCVD.

(10) Statin treatment for older people. A meta-analysis of

randomized trials has shown that the effects of statin therapy are

determined by the absolute reduction in LDL-C as well as the

baseline ASCVD risk, and are independent of all known risk fac
tors, including age. Statin therapy in older people should therefore

be considered according to the estimated level of risk and baseline
