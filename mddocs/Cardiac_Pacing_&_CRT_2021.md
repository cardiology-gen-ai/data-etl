### 1 Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management
strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines
and their recommendations should facilitate decision-making of
health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and

caregiver, as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other societies and organizations. Because of their impact on clinical practice,
quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be
[found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines).](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a
given topic and are regularly updated.
In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the ESC
carries out the EurObservational Research Programme of international
registries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions which are essential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources, and
adherence to guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better
understanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world,
based on high-quality data collected during routine clinical practice.
Furthermore, the ESC has developed and embedded in this document a set of quality indicators (QIs), which are tools to evaluate the
level of implementation of the guidelines and may be used by the
ESC, hospitals, healthcare providers, and professionals to measure
clinical practice as well as in educational programmes, alongside the
key messages from the guidelines, to improve quality of care and clini
cal outcomes.

The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including representation from its relevant ESC subspecialty groups, in order
to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients
with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of a
given condition according to ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines
Committee (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the
risk�benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and
graded according to pre-defined scales, as outlined below.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as

ESC Guidelines 7

Table 1 Classes of recommendations

Wording to use










Table 2 Levels of evidence


real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of
interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest
[rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[guidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
supplementary document simultaneously with the guidelines.
This process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in
the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations
of interest that arose during the writing period were notified to the
ESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support
from the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of
new guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the . [...................................]


endorsement process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines
undergo extensive review by the CPG and external experts. After
appropriate revisions, the guidelines are signed-off by all the
experts involved in the Task Force. The finalized document is
signed-off by the CPG for publication in the European Heart
Journal. The guidelines were developed after careful consideration
of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available
at the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation
of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary
slides, summary cards for non-specialists, and an electronic version

8 ESC Guidelines


for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions are
abridged and thus, for more detailed information, the user should
always access to the full text version of the guidelines, which is freely
available via the ESC website and hosted on the EHJ website. The
National Cardiac Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse,
adopt, translate, and implement all ESC Guidelines. Implementation
programmes are needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough appli
cation of clinical recommendations.

Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well as
in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines
do not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility
of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in
consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation
with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or
necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify
the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.

### 2 Introduction


Pacing is an important part of electrophysiology and of cardiology in
general. Whereas some of the situations requiring pacing are clear and
have not changed over the years, many others have evolved and have
been the subject of extensive recent research, such as pacing after syncope (section 5), pacing following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI; section 8), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for
heart failure (HF) and for prevention of pacing-induced cardiomyopathy (section 6), and pacing in various infiltrative and inflammatory diseases of the heart, as well as in different cardiomyopathies (section 8).
Other novel topics include new diagnostic tools for decision-making
on pacing (section 4), as well as a whole new area of pacing the His bundle and the left bundle branch (section 7). In addition, attention has
increased in other areas, such as how to systematically minimize procedural risk and avoid complications of cardiac pacing (section 9), how
to manage patients with pacemakers in special situations, such as when
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or irradiation are needed (section
11), how to follow patients with a pacemaker with emphasis on the
use of remote monitoring, and how to include shared decision-making
in caring for this patient population (section 12).
The last pacing guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology
(ESC) were published in 2013; therefore, a new set of guidelines was
felt to be timely and necessary.
To address these topics, a Task Force was established to create
the new guidelines. As well as receiving the input of leading experts in
the field of pacing, the Task Force was enhanced by representatives

from the Association for Acute CardioVascular Care, the Heart

Failure Association, the European Association of Cardiothoracic
Surgery, the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular
Interventions, the ESC Working Group on Myocardial and

Pericardial Diseases, as well as the Association of Cardiovascular

Nursing & Allied Professions.

2.1 Evidence review

This document is divided into sections, each with a section coordina
tor and several authors. They were asked to thoroughly review the
recent literature on their topics, and to come up with recommendations and grade them by classification as well as by level of evidence.
Where data seemed controversial, a methodologist (Dipak Kotecha)
was asked to evaluate the strength of the evidence and to assist in
determining the class of recommendation and level of evidence. All
recommendations were voted on by all authors of the document and
were accepted only if supported by at least 75% of the co-authors.
The leaders (Jens Cosedis Nielsen and Michael Glikson) and the
coordinators of this document (Yoav Michowitz and Mads Brix
Kronborg) were responsible for alignment of the recommendations
between sections, and several members of the writing committee
were responsible for overlap with other ESC Guidelines, such as the
HF guidelines and the valvular heart disease guidelines.

2.2 Relationships with industry
All work in this document was voluntary and all co-authors were
required to declare and prove that they do not have conflicts of interests, as defined recently by the Scientific Guideline Committee of the

ESC and the ESC board.

### 3 Background

3.1 Epidemiology
The prevalence and incidence of pacemaker implantation are
unknown in many countries, yet several estimations have been published based on the analysis of large observational studies and databases. There is considerable variability in reported pacemaker
implant rates between European countries, ranging from <25

14 ESC Guidelines










Figure 1 The 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiac pacing and CRT present new and updated recommendations for these treatments in relevant patient
populations.


pacemaker implantations per million people in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and Kyrgyzstan, to >1000 implantations per million
people in France, Italy, and Sweden. [1] These differences may result
from under- or overtreatment with pacemaker therapy in some
countries, or from variations in sociodemographic characteristics
and pathological conditions. There is a continuous growth in the
use of pacemakers due to the increasing life expectancy and ageing of populations. [2][�][8] The estimated number of patients globally
undergoing pacemaker implantation has increased steadily up to
an annual implant rate of �1 million devices. [2] Degeneration of the
cardiac conduction system and changes in intercellular conduction can be manifestations of cardiac pathology or non-cardiac
disease, and are most prevalent in older patients. Therefore, most
bradycardias requiring cardiac pacing are observed in the elderly,
with >80% of pacemakers being implanted in patients above the
age of 65 years.

3.2 Natural history
High-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) and sinus node dysfunction
(SND) are the most common indications for permanent pacemaker
therapy. Conservatively treated (i.e. non-paced) patients with highdegree AVB have notably poorer survival compared with . [...................................................................]


pacemaker-treated patients. [9][�][12] In contrast, SND follows an unpredictable course, and there is no evidence to show that pacemaker
therapy results in improved prognosis. [13][�][15]

Improving life expectancy is not, however, the only objective of
pacemaker therapy. Quality of life is an essential metric for measuring
a patient’s clinical status and outcome, and provides a holistic picture
of clinical treatment effectiveness. [16] Studies have been unanimous in

finding improved quality of life in patients receiving pacing
therapy. [17][�][22]

3.3 Pathophysiology and classification of
bradyarrhythmias considered for
permanent cardiac pacing therapy
Definitions of various conduction disturbances are presented in
[Supplementary Table 1.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
Sinus bradycardia can be considered physiological in response to
specific situations, such as in well-conditioned athletes, young individuals, and during sleep. Pathological bradyarrhythmias are dependent
on their underlying cause and can be broadly categorized into intrinsic and extrinsic aetiologies. Advanced age and age-related degenerative changes are important intrinsic causes of modifications in
electrical impulse initiation and propagation of the conduction

ESC Guidelines 15

system. In addition, genetic mutations have been linked to conduction
disorders (see section 4.3.5), and atrial cardiomyopathy [23] may be a
specific disease that can result in supraventricular tachyarrhythmia,
SND, and atrioventricular node (AVN) disease. [24]

It is essential to differentiate reversible from non-reversible

causes of bradycardia. Potential reversible causes of bradycardia
include adverse drug effects, myocardial infarction (MI), toxic
exposure, infections, surgery, and electrolyte disorders. In a study
including 277 patients referred to the emergency department
with bradycardia, electrolyte disorders were the underlying cause
in 4%, intoxication in 6%, acute MI in 14%, and adverse drug effects
in 21%. [25]

In the case of non-reversible pathological causes of slow heart
rate, the presence and severity of symptoms play an essential role
in the consideration for permanent antibradycardia pacemaker
therapy. This may be challenging in patients with competing mechanisms for their symptoms. In general, candidates for pacing therapy can be broadly classified into two groups: patients with
persistent bradycardia and patients with intermittent [with or
without electrocardiographic (ECG) documentation] bradycardia. Persistent bradycardia usually indicates an intrinsic disease in
the sinus node tissue or the atrioventricular (AV) conduction system, whereas intermittent bradycardia can be a result of a wide
variety of intrinsic and extrinsic pathological processes, as illustrated in Figure 2. [26][�][31] . [..........................................................................]


3.4 Types and modes of pacing: general
description
3.4.1 Endocardial pacing
Endocardial lead-based pacemakers consist of a pulse generator commonly placed in the pectoral region and transvenous lead(s)
implanted into the myocardium with the ability to sense cardiac activity and provide therapeutic cardiac stimulation. Since the introduction of transvenous endocardial pacemakers in the 1960s, major
technological advances have improved their efficacy and safety. In
general, pacemaker implantation is considered a low-risk procedure,
yet it is not exempt from device- and procedure-related complications and malfunction. Pacemaker implantation is covered in detail in
a recent European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) consensus
document. [34]

3.4.2 Epicardial pacing
Some clinical scenarios dictate implantation of an epicardial pacemaker system. These include patients with congenital anomalies and
no venous access to the heart or with an open shunt between the
right and left sides of the circulation, recurrent device infections,
occluded veins, and—most commonly today—in conjunction with
open cardiac surgery. Epicardial leads are currently implanted using
various (minimally invasive) thoracotomy or thoracoscopy and
robotic techniques. [35]

16 ESC Guidelines


3.4.3 Cardiac resynchronization therapy (endo- and/or
epicardial)
Cardiac dyssynchrony is a difference in the timing of electrical and
mechanical activation of the ventricles, which can result in impaired
cardiac efficiency. CRT delivers biventricular pacing to correct electromechanical dyssynchrony in order to increase cardiac output. [36] In
multiple trials, CRT has shown a significant morbidity and mortality
benefit in specific patient groups with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). [37][�][40]

3.4.4 Alternative methods (conduction system pacing,
leadless pacing)
3.4.4.1 Conduction system pacing
Compared with right ventricular (RV) pacing, His bundle pacing
(HBP) provides a more physiological simultaneous electrical activation of the ventricles via the His�Purkinje system. HBP can restore
conduction in a subset of patients with high-degree AVB, and shorten
QRS duration in some patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB)
or right bundle branch block (RBBB). [41][�][44] More studies are ongoing
and required to evaluate whether HBP has clinical benefits over CRT
or RV pacing. In addition, left bundle branch area pacing is being
studied as a pacing modality for patients in whom the conduction disease is too distal for HBP (see section 7.3).

3.4.4.2 Leadless pacing
Miniaturized, intracardiac leadless pacemakers have been introduced.
These devices are inserted percutaneously through the femoral vein
and implanted directly in the RV wall using customized catheterbased delivery systems. The first-generation leadless pacemakers
have been proven to provide effective single-chamber pacing
therapy. [45][�][50] Albeit a promising technology, potential difficulty with
leadless pacemaker retrieval at the end of service is a limitation. Thus
far, there are no randomized controlled data available to compare
clinical outcomes between leadless pacing and single-chamber trans
venous pacing.

3.4.5 Pacing modes
Technological advances in pacemaker therapy have resulted in a wide
variety of pacing modalities. Pacemakers can sense the heart’s intrinsic electrical activity and restore the rate and AV sequence of cardiac
activation. Abnormal cardiac automaticity and conduction may be
treated by single-lead atrial sensing/pacing, single-lead ventricular
sensing/pacing, single leads that pace the right ventricle (RV) and
sense both the atrium and ventricle, and dual-lead systems that sense
and pace the right atrium (RA) and RV. For common pacing modes,
[refer to Supplementary Table 2. The choice of the optimal pacing](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
mode in the presence of conduction disturbances is driven by the
underlying morbidity, the impact of pacing therapy on morbidity, and
the potential harmful effect of the chosen pacing modality. The
choice of pacing modes in specific situations is discussed in section 5.

3.4.6 Rate-responsive pacing
The sinus node modulates the heart rate during different types and
loads of exercise (i.e. physical exercise, emotions, postural change,
and fever) proportional to the metabolic demand. Rate-responsive

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


heart rate during emotional or physical activity by sensing body
motion/acceleration, minute ventilation, intracardiac impedance, or
other surrogates of physical and mental stress, and are indicated in
cases of chronotropic incompetence. [51][�][57] Dual-sensing rate-responsive pacing (e.g. accelerometer and minute ventilation) may be used
in selected patients. [58] A brief overview of the most commonly used
[rate-responsive pacing sensors is given in Supplementary Table 3.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)

3.5 Sex differences

Pacing indications and complication rates differ between male and
female patients. In male patients, primary pacemaker implantation is

more often indicated for AVB and less so for SND and atrial fibrillation (AF) with bradycardia. [59][,][60] In female patients, the rate of
procedure-related adverse events is significantly higher, corrected
for age and type of device. This higher rate is driven mostly by pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, and pocket haematomas. [59][�][61]

Possible explanations for this are a smaller body size in women and

anatomical differences, such as smaller vein diameters and RV

diameters.
### 4 Evaluation of the patient with suspected or documented bradycardia or conduction system disease

4.1 History and physical examination
A careful history and physical examination are essential for the evaluation of patients with suspected or documented bradycardia
(Figure 3). Current guidelines emphasize the importance of the history and physical examination in the initial evaluation, particularly for
identifying patients with structural heart disease. [62][,][63]

A complete history should include family history, comprehensive
cardiovascular risk assessment, and recent/historical diagnoses that
may cause bradycardia. The history should be focused on frequency,
severity, and duration of symptoms that might suggest bradycardia or
conduction system disease. The relationship of symptoms to physical
activity, emotional distress, positional changes, medical treatment
(Table 6), and typical triggers (e.g. urination, defecation, cough, prolonged standing, and shaving) should be explored too, as well as pulse
rate if measured during an episode.
Family history may be especially important in young patients with
progressive cardiac conduction disease either isolated or in association with cardiomyopathies and/or myopathies. [64][,][65]

Physical examination should focus on manifestations of bradycardia and signs of underlying structural heart disease or systemic disorders (Table 7). Symptomatic slow peripheral pulses should be

confirmed with cardiac auscultation or ECG to ensure that other

rhythms are not misrepresented as bradycardia (e.g. premature ventricular contractions).
Autonomic regulation disorders are important in the differential
diagnosis of syncope or near syncope, and, therefore, orthostatic
changes in heart rate and blood pressure may help in the evaluation
of the patients.


3.4.4 Alternative methods (conduction system pacing,
leadless pacing)
3.4.4.1 Conduction system pacing
Compared with right ventricular (RV) pacing, His bundle pacing
(HBP) provides a more physiological simultaneous electrical activation of the ventricles via the His�Purkinje system. HBP can restore
conduction in a subset of patients with high-degree AVB, and shorten
QRS duration in some patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB)
or right bundle branch block (RBBB). [41][�][44] More studies are ongoing
and required to evaluate whether HBP has clinical benefits over CRT
or RV pacing. In addition, left bundle branch area pacing is being
studied as a pacing modality for patients in whom the conduction disease is too distal for HBP (see section 7.3).


3.4.4.2 Leadless pacing
Miniaturized, intracardiac leadless pacemakers have been introduced.
These devices are inserted percutaneously through the femoral vein
and implanted directly in the RV wall using customized catheterbased delivery systems. The first-generation leadless pacemakers
have been proven to provide effective single-chamber pacing
therapy. [45][�][50] Albeit a promising technology, potential difficulty with
leadless pacemaker retrieval at the end of service is a limitation. Thus
far, there are no randomized controlled data available to compare
clinical outcomes between leadless pacing and single-chamber trans
venous pacing.


3.4.5 Pacing modes
Technological advances in pacemaker therapy have resulted in a wide
variety of pacing modalities. Pacemakers can sense the heart’s intrinsic electrical activity and restore the rate and AV sequence of cardiac
activation. Abnormal cardiac automaticity and conduction may be
treated by single-lead atrial sensing/pacing, single-lead ventricular
sensing/pacing, single leads that pace the right ventricle (RV) and
sense both the atrium and ventricle, and dual-lead systems that sense
and pace the right atrium (RA) and RV. For common pacing modes,

underlying morbidity, the impact of pacing therapy on morbidity, and
the potential harmful effect of the chosen pacing modality. The
choice of pacing modes in specific situations is discussed in section 5.


3.4.6 Rate-responsive pacing

loads of exercise (i.e. physical exercise, emotions, postural change,
and fever) proportional to the metabolic demand. Rate-responsive
pacemaker systems strive to produce an appropriate compensatory

Carotid sinus massage (CSM) can be helpful in any patient >_40
years old with symptoms suggestive of carotid sinus syndrome (CSS):
syncope or near syncope elicited by tight collars, shaving, or turning
the head. [66][,][67] Methodology and response to CSM are described in

features of spontaneous syncope compatible with a reflex
mechanism. [68][�][70]

4.2 Electrocardiogram
Together with the history and physical examination, the resting ECG
is an essential component of the initial evaluation of patients with
documented or suspected bradycardia. A 12-lead ECG or a rhythm
strip during the symptomatic episode provides the definitive
diagnosis.
For those in whom physical examination suggests a bradycardia, a
12-lead ECG is useful to confirm the rhythm, rate, nature, and extent
[of conduction disturbance (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, an](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)

voltage) that predict adverse outcomes in symptomatic patients. [62]

4.3.1 Ambulatory electrocardiographic
monitoring
The intermittent nature of most symptomatic bradycardia secondary
to conduction system disease often requires prolonged ambulatory
ECG monitoring to correlate rhythm disturbances with symptoms.
This monitoring allows detection of interruption of AV conduction
by either primary disease of the conductive system, a vagal or neurocardiogenic mechanism, or reflex AV block. [72][,][72a]

Ambulatory ECG identifies defects of sinus automaticity, which

�
includes sinus pauses, sinus bradycardia, bradycardia tachycardia
syndrome, asystole post-conversion of atrial flutter or AF, and chro
notropic incompetence.
Different versions of ambulatory ECG monitoring have been
reviewed recently in a comprehensive expert consensus
[(Supplementary Table 4).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data) [73] Ambulatory ECG selection depends on
the frequency and nature of the symptoms (Table 8).

Exercise testing can be used to diagnose symptomatic chronotropic incompetence, defined as an inability to increase the heart rate
commensurate with the increased metabolic demands of physical
activity. [74][,][75] The most commonly used definition of chronotropic
incompetence has been failure to reach 80% of the expected heart
rate reserve. Expected heart rate reserve is defined as the difference
between the age-predicted maximal heart rate (220 � age) and the
resting heart rate. However, some medical treatments and comorbidities cause exercise intolerance and make the diagnosis of chronotropic incompetence by exercise testing more difficult.
In patients with exercise-related symptoms, the development or
progression of AVB may occasionally be the underlying cause.
Tachycardia-related exercise-induced second-degree and complete
AVB have been shown to be located distal to the AVN and predict
progression to permanent AVB. [76][�][78] Usually, these patients show
intraventricular conduction abnormalities on the resting ECG, but a
normal resting ECG has also been described in such cases. [77][,][79]

Exercise testing may expose advanced infranodal AVB in the presence of conduction system disease of uncertain location.
In rare cases, conduction disturbances induced by exercise are
caused by myocardial ischaemia or coronary vasospasm, and exercise
testing may reproduce the symptoms. [80][,][81]

There are no data supporting an indication for exercise testing in
patients without exercise-related symptoms. Exercise testing may be
useful in selected patients to distinguish AVN from conduction disturbances in the His�Purkinje system below the AVN in the setting

of conduction disturbance at an unclear level.

context of haemodynamic instability. When coronary artery disease
is suspected, coronary computed tomography (CT), angiography, or
stress imaging is recommended. [82] Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and nuclear imaging techniques provide information on
tissue characterization (inflammation, fibrosis/scar) and should be
considered before pacemaker implantation when specific aetiologies
associated with conduction abnormalities are suspected (specially in
young patients). Late gadolinium contrast enhanced (LGE) and T2
CMR techniques allow the diagnosis of specific causes of conduction
disturbances (i.e. sarcoidosis and myocarditis). Late gadolinium contrast enhancement CMR helps in the decision-making of individuals
with arrhythmic events; the presence of large areas of LGE (scar/fibrosis) has been linked to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias
regardless of LVEF and may indicate the need for an implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). [83][�][85] T2 CMR sequences are suited
for the detection of myocardial inflammation (i.e. oedema and hyperaemia) as a potential cause of transitory conduction abnormalities
that may not need permanent pacemaker implantation. [86] Similarly,
positron emission tomography (PET) combined with CMR or CT
helps in the diagnosis of inflammatory activity status of infiltrative cardiomyopathies (i.e. sarcoidosis). [87][,][88]

4.3.5 Genetic testing
Most cardiac conduction disorders are due to either ageing or structural abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system caused by
underlying structural heart disease. Genes responsible for inherited

cardiac diseases associated with cardiac conduction disorders have
been identified. [65][,][95][,][96]

Genetic mutations have been linked to a range of abnormalities
that may present in isolated forms of cardiac conduction disorder or
in association with cardiomyopathy, congenital cardiac anomalies, or
extra-cardiac disorders. Most genetically mediated cardiac conduction disorders have an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance [65][,][95]

[(Supplementary Table 5).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
Progressive cardiac conduction disease (PCCD) may be
diagnosed in the presence of unexplained progressive conduction
abnormalities in young (<50 years) individuals with structurally normal hearts in the absence of skeletal myopathies, especially if there is
a family history of PCCD. [97] Common PCCD-associated genes are

SCN5A and TRPM4 for isolated forms and LMNA for PCCD associ
ated with HF.

The diagnosis of PCCD in an index patient is based on clinical data
including history, family history, and 12-lead ECG. The potential presence of congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or cardiomyopathy must
be investigated with cardiac imaging.
Early-onset PCCD, either isolated or with concomitant structural
heart disease, should prompt consideration of PCCD genetic testing,
particularly in patients with a positive family history of conduction
abnormalities, pacemaker implants, or sudden death. [97]

A consensus panel has endorsed mutation-specific genetic testing
for family members and appropriate relatives after the identification
of a PCCD causative mutation in an index case. Such testing can be
deferred in asymptomatic children because of the age-dependent
nature of cardiac conduction diseases and incomplete penetrance. [65]

However, every case should be individually evaluated depending of

the risk of the detected mutation.

Asymptomatic family members who are positive for the family’s
PCCD-associated mutation should be regularly followed for development of cardiac conduction disease-related symptoms, deterioration of cardiac conduction, and beginning of HF.

4.3.6 Sleep evaluation
Nocturnal bradyarrhythmias are common in the general population.
In most circumstances, these are physiological, vagally mediated
asymptomatic events, which do not require intervention. [98][�][100]

Patients with sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) have a higher prevalence of sleep-related bradycardia (both sinus and conduction system
related) during apnoeic episodes. [101][,][102] SAS-induced hypoxaemia is a
key mechanism leading to an increased vagal tone and bradycardic
rhythm disorders. [101][,][102] Another rare mechanism of sleep-related
bradycardia (usually in the form of prolonged sinus arrest) is rapid
eye movement sleep-related bradycardia, unrelated to apnoea. This
mechanism can also be diagnosed by polysomnography. [103] Although
most cases quoted in the literature have been treated with pace
makers, the evidence for this is scant, and there is no consensus on
how to treat these patients. [103]

Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alleviates obstructive sleep apnoea-related symptoms and improves cardiovascular outcomes. Appropriate treatment reduces episodes of

�
bradycardia by 72 89%, [104] and patients are unlikely to develop
symptomatic bradycardia at long-term follow-up. [104][�][106] Therefore,
patients with asymptomatic nocturnal bradyarrhythmias or cardiac
conduction diseases should be evaluated for SAS. If the diagnosis is
confirmed, treatment of sleep apnoea with CPAP and weight loss can
be effective in improving bradyarrhythmias occurring during sleep,
and permanent pacing should be avoided. In patients with known or
suspected SAS and symptomatic bradyarrhythmias not associated
with sleep, a more complex assessment of the risks associated with
bradyarrhythmias vs. the benefit of cardiac pacing is needed.

4.3.7 Tilt testing
Tilt testing should be considered to confirm a diagnosis of reflex syncope in patients in whom this diagnosis was suspected but not confirmed by initial evaluation. [62][,][107] The endpoint of tilt testing is the
reproduction of symptoms along with the characteristic circulatory
pattern of the reflex syncope. The methodology and classification of
[responses are described in section 4.2 in the Supplementary data and](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
[in Supplementary Figure 1.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
A positive cardioinhibitory response to tilt testing predicts, with
high probability, asystolic spontaneous syncope; this finding is relevant for therapy when cardiac pacing is considered (see section 5.4).
Conversely, the presence of a positive vasodepressor, a mixed
response, or even a negative response does not exclude asystole during spontaneous syncope. [62]

4.4 Implantable monitors
Patients with infrequent symptoms of bradycardia (less than once per
month) need a longer duration of ECG monitoring. For these
patients, the implantable loop recorder (ILR) is an ideal diagnostic
tool given its capacity for prolonged monitoring (up to 3 years) and
without the need for active patient participation (Table 8).
In patients with unexplained syncope after the initial evaluation
and infrequent symptoms (less than once a month), several studies
have demonstrated a higher efficacy of initial ILR implantation compared with a conventional strategy. Many conditions diagnosed by
ILR are bradycardia mediated. [108][�][112] For further discussion on the
diagnostic roles of ILR and ambulatory ECG, and indications for their
use, refer to the ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of
syncope. [62]

4.5 Electrophysiology study
The development of non-invasive ambulatory ECG technologies has
reduced the need for the electrophysiology study (EPS) as a diagnostic test. EPS is generally an adjunctive tool in the evaluation of patients
with syncope in whom bradycardia is suspected but has not been
documented after non-invasive evaluation (Figure 4). The goal of an
EPS in the context of bradycardia evaluation is to identify abnormal

sinus node function or the anatomical location of the cardiac conduc
�
tion disorders (in the AVN or in the His Purkinje system distal to
the AVN). . [.............................]


In patients with syncope and sinus bradycardia, the pre-test
probability of bradycardia-related syncope increases when there is a
sinus bradycardia (<50 b.p.m.) or sinoatrial block. Observational
studies have shown a relationship between prolonged sinus node
recovery time with syncope and the effect of pacing on
symptoms. [113][,][114]

In patients with syncope and bifascicular block, a prolonged
His�ventricular interval (HV) >_70 ms, or HV >_100 ms after pharmacological stress (ajmaline, procainamide, flecainide, or disopyramide),
or induction of second- or third-degree AVB by atrial pacing or by

pharmacological stress, identifies a group at higher risk of developing
AVB. [115][�][122]

The efficacy of EPS for the diagnosis of syncope is highest in
patients with sinus bradycardia, bifascicular block, and suspected
tachycardia, [62] and lowest in patients with syncope, a normal ECG, no
structural heart disease, and no palpitations. Therefore, EPS is preferred over ILR in patients with syncope who have a high pre-test
probability for significant conduction disease (e.g. abnormal ECG,
BBB, ischaemic heart disease, or scar-related cardiomyopathy). For
patients with a low pre-test probability (no structural heart disease,
normal ECG), ILR is preferred over EPS. EPS is also preferred when
there is a high likelihood that another syncopal episode will be dangerous or life-threatening and an immediate diagnosis is likely if EPS is
performed.
A negative EPS does not exclude an arrhythmic syncope, and further evaluation is warranted. Approximately one-third of patients
with a negative EPS in whom an ILR is implanted develop AVB at follow-up. [123]

### 5 Cardiac pacing for bradycardia and conduction system disease

5.1 Pacing for sinus node dysfunction
SND, also known as sick sinus syndrome, comprises a wide spectrum
of sinoatrial dysfunctions, ranging from sinus bradycardia, sinoatrial

�
block, and sinus arrest to bradycardia tachycardia syndrome. [124][,][125]

An additional manifestation of SND is an inadequate chronotropic
response to exercise, reported as chronotropic incompetence.

5.1.1 Indications for pacing
5.1.1.1 Sinus node dysfunction
In general, pacing for asymptomatic SND has never been shown to

. [.........................................................................................................................................................................]


be considered as an appropriate indication for permanent pacing
only when bradycardia due to SND is symptomatic. [126] Patients with
SND may manifest symptoms attributable to bradyarrhythmia and/or
symptoms of accompanying atrial tachyarrhythmias in the bradycardia�tachycardia form of the disease. Symptoms may be present
either at rest or at the end of the tachyarrhythmic episode (conversion pause also named pre-automaticity pause), or develop during
exercise, and may range from mild fatigue to light-headedness, dizzy
spells, near-syncope, to syncope. Dyspnoea on exertion may be
related to chronotropic incompetence. Syncope is a common manifestation of SND and has been reported in 50% of patients who
receive a pacemaker for SND. [127]

Establishing a correlation between symptoms and bradyarrhythmia is a crucial step in decision-making. However, age, concomitant
heart disease, and other comorbidities may pose difficulties in

�
establishing a clear cause effect relationship between SND and

symptoms.
The effect of cardiac pacing on the natural history of bradyarrhyth
mias was evaluated in non-randomized studies undertaken at the

beginning of the pacemaker era, which suggested a symptomatic
improvement with cardiac pacing. [128][�][131] This was confirmed by one
randomized controlled trial (RCT) [14] in which 107 patients (aged 73
± 11 years) with symptomatic SND were randomized to no treatment, oral theophylline, or dual-chamber (DDD) rate-responsive
pacemaker therapy. In this study, the occurrence of syncope and HF
was lower in the pacemaker group during a follow-up of 19 ± 14

months.

In patients presenting with exercise intolerance in whom chronotropic incompetence has been identified, the usefulness of cardiac
pacing is uncertain, and the decision to implant a pacemaker in such
patients should be made on a case by case basis.
In some cases, symptomatic bradyarrhythmias may be related to
transient, potentially reversible, or treatable conditions (section 4,
Table 7). In such cases, correction of these factors is required,
whereas permanent pacing is not indicated. In clinical practice, it is
crucial to distinguish physiological bradycardia (due to autonomic
influences or training effects) from inappropriate bradycardia that
requires permanent cardiac pacing. For example, sinus bradycardia,
even when it is 40�50 b.p.m. while at rest or as slow as 30 b.p.m.
while sleeping, particularly in trained athletes, could be accepted as a
physiological finding that does not require cardiac pacing.
Asymptomatic bradycardia (due to either sinus pauses or AVB episodes) is not uncommon and warrants interpretation in the clinical
context of the patient: in healthy subjects, pauses >2.5 s are uncommon, but this per se does not necessarily constitute a clinical disorder;
asymptomatic bradyarrhythmias are common in athletes. [132] In the
absence of published trials, no recommendations for bradycardia
detected in asymptomatic patients can be made. On the other hand,
in patients investigated for syncope in whom asymptomatic pause(s)
>6 s due to sinus arrest are eventually documented, pacing may be
indicated. Indeed, such patients constituted a small minority of those
included in an observational study and a randomized trial on pacing in
reflex syncope. [133][,][134] In patients presenting with sleep-related
asymptomatic intermittent bradycardia (sinus bradycardia or AVB),
sleep apnoea and rapid eye movement sleep-related bradycardia
should be considered as possible causes.


The efficacy of EPS for the diagnosis of syncope is highest in
patients with sinus bradycardia, bifascicular block, and suspected
tachycardia, [62] and lowest in patients with syncope, a normal ECG, no
structural heart disease, and no palpitations. Therefore, EPS is preferred over ILR in patients with syncope who have a high pre-test
probability for significant conduction disease (e.g. abnormal ECG,
BBB, ischaemic heart disease, or scar-related cardiomyopathy). For
patients with a low pre-test probability (no structural heart disease,
normal ECG), ILR is preferred over EPS. EPS is also preferred when
there is a high likelihood that another syncopal episode will be dangerous or life-threatening and an immediate diagnosis is likely if EPS is
performed.
A negative EPS does not exclude an arrhythmic syncope, and further evaluation is warranted. Approximately one-third of patients
with a negative EPS in whom an ILR is implanted develop AVB at follow-up. [123]

5.1.1.2 Bradycardia tachycardia form of sinus node dysfunction

�
The bradycardia tachycardia variant of SND is the most common
form, and is characterized by progressive, age-related, degenerative
fibrosis of the sinus node tissue and atrial myocardium.
Bradyarrhythmias can be associated with various forms of atrial
tachyarrhythmias, including AF. [125] In this form of SND, the bradyarrhythmias may correspond to atrial pauses due to sinoatrial blocks or
may be due to overdrive suppression after an atrial
tachyarrhythmia. [135]

Atrial tachyarrhythmias may be present at the time of diagnosis,
typically with sinus arrest and asystolic pauses at the termination of
atrial tachyarrhythmias or after device implant. Control of atrial
tachyarrhythmias in patients presenting with high ventricular rates
may be difficult before implant, as drugs prescribed for rate control
may worsen bradyarrhythmias. Ablation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia,
mainly AF, has been proposed in lieu of pacing and continuing medications for selected patients, [136][�][138] but no data are available from

RCTs to show whether catheter ablation of AF is non-inferior to car
diac pacing with respect to bradycardia-related symptoms in patients

�
with bradycardia tachycardia syndrome. [139] If drug treatment is
chosen, bradyarrhythmias during drug treatment for rate or rhythm
control may be managed by dose reduction or discontinuation as an
alternative to cardiac pacing, but in many cases bradyarrhythmias

persist.

5.1.2 Pacing mode and algorithm selection
In patients with SND, controlled studies found that DDD was superior to single-chamber ventricular pacing in reducing the incidence of
AF. These studies also showed some effect of DDD pacing on the
occurrence of stroke. [140][,][141] Dual-chamber pacing reduces the risk of
pacemaker syndrome, which may occur in more than a quarter of
patients with SND. [21][,][142] Pacemaker syndrome is associated with a
reduction in quality of life and usually justifies the preference for
DDD vs. ventricular rate-modulated pacing in SND, when reasonable. [143] Potential exceptions are very elderly and/or frail patients
with infrequent pauses who have limited functional capacity and/or a
short expected survival. In these patients, the benefit of DDD(R) vs.
VVIR pacing is expected to have limited or no clinical impact, and the
incremental risk of complications related to the second atrial lead
required in DDD(R) implants should also be considered when
choosing the pacing mode. In patients with SND treated with a DDD
pacemaker, programming of the AV interval and specific algorithms
for minimizing RV pacing may further reduce the risk of AF and particularly of persistent AF. [144] Dual-chamber pacing is safer and more
sustainable than atrial-only pacing modes used in the past, [127] even
though single-lead atrial pacing was found to be superior to singlelead ventricular pacing. [145][,][146] The results of studies that evaluated different pacing modes in bradyarrhythmias, including in some cases
[both SND and AVB, are shown in Supplementary Table 6.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
With regard to the choice between DDD(R) and atrial pacing
atrial sensing inhibited-response rate-adaptive (AAIR) pacing, an RCT
with only 177 patients suggested a reduced risk of AF with AAIR. [147]

However, the most recent DANish Multicenter Randomized Trial on

Syndrome (DANPACE), which enrolled 1415 patients followed for a
mean of 5.4 years, found no difference between DDD(R) and AAIR
pacing in all-cause mortality. [127] The DANPACE trial also found a
higher incidence of paroxysmal AF [hazard ratio (HR) 1.27] and a
two-fold increased risk of pacemaker reoperation with AAIR, with

�
AVB developing in 0.6 1.9% of patients every year. [127] These findings
support the routine use of DDD(R) rather than AAIR pacing in
patients with SND.
In view of these data, DDD(R) is the pacing mode of first choice in
SND (Figure 5). Unnecessary RV pacing should be systematically
avoided in patients with SND, because it may cause AF and deterioration of HF, particularly if systolic function is impaired or borderline. [144][,][148] This can be achieved by programming of the AV interval
or using specific algorithms for minimizing RV pacing. Programming
an excessively long AV interval to avoid RV pacing in patients with
prolonged AV conduction may be disadvantageous from a haemodynamic point of view by causing diastolic mitral regurgitation, which
may lead to symptoms and/or AF. [144][,][149][,][150]

Pacing algorithms for minimizing ventricular pacing are often used
in SND. [144][,][151] A meta-analysis of algorithms for minimizing RV pacing
failed to show a significant effect compared with conventional DDD
pacing in patients with normal ventricular function with regard to
endpoints such as incidence of persistent/permanent AF, all-cause
hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. [152] However, the rationale for
reducing unnecessary RV pacing remains strong and is coupled with
the benefits of extending device longevity. [151][,][152] Some manufacturerspecific algorithms are more effective in minimizing ventricular pacing,
but may confer disadvantages in allowing decoupling between atria
and ventricles. [153][,][154] Rarely, algorithms designed to minimize ventricular pacing can cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that are
pause dependent or pause triggered. [155][�][158] No direct comparison
of these algorithms has been performed so far, but pooled data from
randomized trials do not show clear-cut superiority of any specific
algorithm in improving clinical outcome. [152][,][159]

In patients with severely reduced LVEF and a SND indication for
pacing, in whom a high percentage of ventricular pacing is expected,
an indication for CRT or HBP should be evaluated (see section 6 on
CRT and section 7 on HBP).
The role of pacing algorithms for preventing AF has been the subject of controversy. A series of algorithms for preventing/suppressing
AF has been tested, such as dynamic atrial overdrive pacing, atrial
pacing in response to atrial premature beats, pacing in response to
exercise, and post-mode-switch pacing. The clinical evaluation of
these algorithms, also applied at different atrial pacing sites, is not
convincing and no clinical benefit with regard to major clinical endpoints has been demonstrated. [160][,][161]

Atrial antitachycardia pacing [ATP; i.e. delivery of atrial stimuli at
high frequencies to convert an atrial tachyarrhythmia to sinus rhythm
(SR)] has also been tested for reducing the atrial tachyarrhythmia
burden and counteracting the tendency over time towards progression to permanent AF. [162] Conventional delivery of atrial ATP in a
way that mirrors the delivery of ventricular ATP (bursts/ramp at
arrhythmia onset) has a relatively low success rate, and indeed the tri
als based on conventional atrial ATP showed no benefit on AF burden or clinical events. [163] A new form of ATP delivery has been


Atrial tachyarrhythmias may be present at the time of diagnosis,
typically with sinus arrest and asystolic pauses at the termination of
atrial tachyarrhythmias or after device implant. Control of atrial
tachyarrhythmias in patients presenting with high ventricular rates
may be difficult before implant, as drugs prescribed for rate control
may worsen bradyarrhythmias. Ablation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia,
mainly AF, has been proposed in lieu of pacing and continuing medications for selected patients, [136][�][138] but no data are available from

RCTs to show whether catheter ablation of AF is non-inferior to car
diac pacing with respect to bradycardia-related symptoms in patients

�
with bradycardia tachycardia syndrome. [139] If drug treatment is
chosen, bradyarrhythmias during drug treatment for rate or rhythm
control may be managed by dose reduction or discontinuation as an
alternative to cardiac pacing, but in many cases bradyarrhythmias

persist.


5.1.2 Pacing mode and algorithm selection
In patients with SND, controlled studies found that DDD was superior to single-chamber ventricular pacing in reducing the incidence of
AF. These studies also showed some effect of DDD pacing on the
occurrence of stroke. [140][,][141] Dual-chamber pacing reduces the risk of
pacemaker syndrome, which may occur in more than a quarter of
patients with SND. [21][,][142] Pacemaker syndrome is associated with a
reduction in quality of life and usually justifies the preference for
DDD vs. ventricular rate-modulated pacing in SND, when reasonable. [143] Potential exceptions are very elderly and/or frail patients
with infrequent pauses who have limited functional capacity and/or a
short expected survival. In these patients, the benefit of DDD(R) vs.
VVIR pacing is expected to have limited or no clinical impact, and the
incremental risk of complications related to the second atrial lead
required in DDD(R) implants should also be considered when
choosing the pacing mode. In patients with SND treated with a DDD
pacemaker, programming of the AV interval and specific algorithms
for minimizing RV pacing may further reduce the risk of AF and particularly of persistent AF. [144] Dual-chamber pacing is safer and more
sustainable than atrial-only pacing modes used in the past, [127] even
though single-lead atrial pacing was found to be superior to singlelead ventricular pacing. [145][,][146] The results of studies that evaluated different pacing modes in bradyarrhythmias, including in some cases
[both SND and AVB, are shown in Supplementary Table 6.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
With regard to the choice between DDD(R) and atrial pacing
atrial sensing inhibited-response rate-adaptive (AAIR) pacing, an RCT
with only 177 patients suggested a reduced risk of AF with AAIR. [147]

conventional DDD(R)]. The positive effect on the primary endpoint
was due to a lower rate of progression to permanent AF. A post-hoc
analysis indicated that this form of atrial ATP was an independent
predictor of permanent or persistent AF reduction. [162][,][164][,][165] In
CHD, where re-entrant atrial arrhythmias are very common, use of
DDD(R) pacemakers with atrial ATP may be considered (see section
8 on pacing in CHD).

26 ESC Guidelines


AVB, manifestations of fatigue, exertional intolerance, and HF are
sometimes underestimated. Deterioration of cognitive functions is
often only speculative so that the possibilities of improvement after
implantation of a pacemaker are unpredictable and unlikely. Death in
patients with untreated AVB is due not only to HF secondary to low
cardiac output, but also to SCD caused by prolonged asystole or
bradycardia-triggered ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Although RCTs of
pacing in AVB have not been performed, it is clear from several
observational studies that pacing prevents recurrence of syncope and
improves survival. [10][�][12]

5.2.1.1 First-degree atrioventricular block
Usually the prognosis is good in the absence of structural heart
disease, and progression to high-degree block is uncommon. [175] The
indication for pacing relies on an established correlation between
symptoms and AVB. There is weak evidence to show that marked PR
prolongation (i.e. >_300 ms), particularly when it persists or is prolonged during exercise, can lead to symptoms similar to pacemaker
syndrome and/or that these can improve with pacing. [176] Symptom
correlation is crucial, although it may be difficult if these are nonspecific and subtle. In the absence of a clear correlation, a pacemaker
is generally not indicated.

5.2.1.2 Second-degree type I atrioventricular block (Mobitz type I or
Wenckebach)
In addition to the presence or absence of symptoms, the risk of progression to higher degrees of AVB should be considered. Supranodal
block has a benign course, and the risk of progression to type II or a
higher degree of AV block is low. Small, retrospective studies have
suggested that, over the long term, this type of AVB carries a higher
risk of death in patients aged >_45 years in the absence of pacemaker
implantation. [177][,][178] Infranodal block (rare in this form of block) carries a high risk of progression to complete heart block, syncope, and
sudden death, and warrants pacing even in the absence of
symptoms. [179][,][180]

5.2.1.3 Second-degree Mobitz type II, 2:1, and advanced atrioventricular
block (also named high-grade atrioventricular block, where the P:QRS
ratio is 3:1 or higher), third-degree atrioventricular block

In the absence of a reversible cause, due to the risk of occurrence of

severe symptoms and/or possible progression towards a more
severe or complete AVB, patients should receive a pacemaker even
in the absence of symptoms. In asymptomatic patients in whom a 2:1
AVB is found incidentally, the decision for implantation should be
made on a case by case basis including distinction between nodal and
infranodal AVB. This distinction may be based on observations such
as PR or PP interval prolongation before AVB, the effect of exercise

on AV conduction, and an EPS.

5.2.1.4 Paroxysmal atrioventricular block
Because of the risk of syncope and SCD and of the potential progression to permanent AVB, the indications for pacing are the same for
paroxysmal as for permanent AVB. It is crucial to rule out a reversible
cause and to recognize the reflex forms of AVB, which may not need
pacing. Documentation of infranodal block by EPS or the documentation of initiation of the block by atrial or ventricular premature beats,
or increased heart rate (tachy-dependent AVB) or decreased heart

DDD over ventricular pacing with regard to mortality, and have not
consistently shown superiority in terms of quality of life or morbidity
(including stroke or transient ischaemic attack and AF). [20][,][140][,][181] Dualchamber pacing is beneficial over ventricular pacing due to the avoidance of pacemaker syndrome, which occurred in up to a quarter of
patients with AVB in these trials. In a meta-analysis of 20 crossover
trials, DDD was associated with an improved exercise capacity compared with ventricular pacing. However, the effect was driven by
non-rate-modulated ventricular pacemakers, and no benefit was
observed from the comparison of DDD with VVIR pacing. [182] . [....................................................]


5.2.2 Pacing mode and algorithm selection
5.2.2.1 Dual-chamber vs. ventricular pacing
Large, randomized, parallel trials that included patients with only
AVB [181] or with AVB and/or SND [140] failed to show superiority of
DDD over ventricular pacing with regard to mortality, and have not

trials, DDD was associated with an improved exercise capacity compared with ventricular pacing. However, the effect was driven by
non-rate-modulated ventricular pacemakers, and no benefit was
observed from the comparison of DDD with VVIR pacing. [182]

Pacemaker syndrome is associated with reduction in quality of life
and may require a reintervention for upgrading, justifying the preference for DDD when reasonable (i.e. in patients who do not present
with significant frailty, very advanced age, significant comorbidities
limiting their life expectancy, or a very limited mobility). Another consideration is the diagnosis of AF, which is more reliable from device
data in patients with DDD pacemakers. On a case by case basis, in
frail elderly patients, and/or when AVB is paroxysmal and pacing
anticipated to be infrequent, VVIR pacing may be considered as it
carries a lower complication rate. [140]

There is strong evidence to show that chronic conventional RV
pacing may be deleterious in some patients and may lead to LV dysfunction and HF, [148] even when AV synchrony is maintained. [183] This
effect is only partly explained by the abnormal activation sequence
and may involve myocardial perfusion, and humoral, cellular, and
molecular changes. [184][,][185] Compared with a matched control cohort,
patients with a pacemaker and an RV lead have an increased risk of
HF, which is also associated with older age, previous MI, kidney disease, and male sex. [186] Pacing-induced cardiomyopathy occurs in
10�20% of patients after 2�4 years of RV pacing. [186][�][188] It is associated with a >20% RV pacing burden. [187][�][190] However, there are no
data to support that any percentage of RV pacing can be considered
as defining a true limit below which RV pacing is safe and beyond
which RV pacing is harmful. For discussion of potential indications for
CRT and/or HBP to prevent pacing-induced cardiomyopathy, please

symptoms due to bradycardia and of high-degree or infranodal block,
pacing is unlikely to be beneficial and is not indicated.
In patients with AF who undergo atrioventricular junction (AVJ)
ablation to control rapid ventricular rates, there is evidence to show
that AVJ ablation plus RV pacing improves symptoms and quality of
life. [192] In contrast, neutral results were found regarding the progression of HF, hospitalization, and mortality, [193] except in one study. [194]

Compared with pharmacological rate control, AVJ ablation and CRT
reduced the risks of death due to HF, hospitalization due to HF, or
worsening HF by 62%, and improved specific symptoms of AF by
36% in elderly patients with permanent AF and narrow QRS. [195] In
other studies, this beneficial effect was limited to patients with HF or
reduced ejection fraction (EF). [166][,][196] For further discussion of the
role of CRT following AVJ ablation, refer to section 6. There is weak
evidence to support a benefit from para-Hisian and Hisian pacing
after AVJ ablation for refractory AF. [197][�][200] For further discussion,

refer to section 7.

Recommendations for pacing for atrioventricular block


5.2.2.2 Atrioventricular block in the case of permanent atrial fibrillation
In the presence of AF, AVB should be suspected if the ventricular
rate is slow and the ventricular rhythm regular. During prolonged
monitoring, long ventricular pauses may be detected. [191] In patients
with AF and no permanent AVB or symptoms, there is no identifiable,
minimum pause duration as an indication for pacing. In the absence of
a potentially reversible cause, bradycardia or inappropriate chronotropic response (due to either intermittent or complete AVB) associated or reasonably correlated with symptoms is an indication for
cardiac pacing. Any high-degree or infranodal block is also an indication for pacing, even in the absence of symptoms. In the absence of

28 ESC Guidelines


In patients with AF, compared with fixed rate pacing, rateresponsive pacing is associated with better exercise performance,
improved daily activities, a decrease in symptoms of shortness of
breath, chest pain, and palpitations, and improved quality of
life. [201][�][203] It has also been shown to improve heart rate and blood
pressure response to mental stress compared with fixed rate pacing. [204] Therefore, rate-adaptive pacing is the pacing mode of first
choice. Fixed-rate VVI pacing should be reserved for older sedentary
patients who have very limited activity. Commonly, the minimum
rate is programmed higher (e.g. 70 b.p.m.) than for patients in SR in
an attempt to compensate for loss of active atrial filling.

5.3 Pacing for conduction disorders
without atrioventricular block

This section focuses on patients with 1:1 AV conduction and QRS
abnormalities caused by delayed or blocked conduction of the
His�Purkinje system: BBB, fascicular block in isolation or in combination with BBB, and non-specific intraventricular delay. Bifascicular

block is defined as LBBB or the combination of RBBB and with left
anterior or posterior fascicular block. . [..............................................................]


5.3.1.2 Bundle branch block, unexplained syncope, and abnormal electrophysiological study
Electrophysiological assessment includes measurement of the
HV at baseline, with stress by incremental atrial pacing or by


Isolated fascicular block and BBB are rarely associated with symptoms; however, their presence may be a marker for underlying structural heart disease. The presence or absence of symptoms referable
to intermittent bradycardia will guide the evaluation of these patients.

5.3.1 Indications for pacing
5.3.1.1 Bundle branch block and unexplained syncope
Although syncope is not associated with an increased incidence of
sudden death in patients with preserved cardiac function, a high incidence of total deaths (about one-third sudden) was observed in
patients with BBB and HF, previous MI, or low EF. [208][�][210] Indeed, in
those with low EF, syncope is a risk factor for death. [211]

Unfortunately, ventricular-programmed stimulation does not seem
to identify these patients correctly; therefore, an ICD or a defibrillator with CRT (CRT-D) is indicated in patients with BBB and LVEF
<35% for the prevention of SCD (Figure 6). [63]

pharmacological provocation (ajmaline, procainamide, or flecainide).
Scheinman et al. studied the prognostic value of the HV: the progression rate to AVB at 4 years was 4% in patients with HV <70 ms, 12%
in patients with HV between 70 and 100 ms, and 24% in patients with
HV >100 ms. [121] Development of intra- or infra-His block at incremental atrial pacing or by pharmacological stress test increases the
sensitivity and positive predictive value of the EPS to identify patients
who will develop AVB. [116][�][118][,][120][,][122][,][212] A positive EPS yielded a positive predictive value as high as 80% to identify patients who develop
AVB. This finding has been indirectly confirmed by a study that
showed a significant reduction in syncopal recurrences in patients
with positive EPS treated with a pacemaker, compared with a control
group of untreated patients with a negative EPS. [119] In patients with
unexplained syncope and bifascicular block, EPS is highly sensitive in
identifying patients with intermittent or impending high-degree AVB.
However, a negative EPS cannot rule out intermittent/paroxysmal
AVB as the cause of syncope. Indeed, in patients with a negative EPS,
intermittent or stable AVB was documented by ILR in �50% of cases.
Therefore, elderly patients with bifascicular block and unexplained
syncope might benefit from an empirical pacemaker, especially in
unpredictable and recurrent syncope that exposes the patient to a
high risk of traumatic recurrences. The decision to implant a pacemaker in these patients should be based on individual risk�benefit
evaluation. [213]

5.3.1.3 Alternating bundle branch block

This rare condition refers to situations in which there is clear ECG

evidence for block in all three fascicles on successive ECGs; examples
are LBBB and RBBB morphologies on successive ECGs, or RBBB

with associated left anterior fascicular block on one ECG and left
posterior fascicular block on another ECG. [214] There is general consensus that this phenomenon is associated with significant infranodal
disease and that patients will progress rapidly toward AVB.
Therefore, a pacemaker should be implanted as soon as the alternating BBB is detected, even in the absence of symptoms.

5.3.1.4 Bundle branch block without symptoms
Permanent pacemaker implantation is not indicated for BBB without
symptoms, with the exception of alternating BBB, because only a
minority of these patients will develop AVB (1�2% per
year). [115][,][121][,][215] The risks of pacemaker implantation and long-term
transvenous lead complications are higher than the benefits of pacemaker implantation. [216][,][217]

5.3.1.5 Patients with neuromuscular diseases

In patients with neuromuscular diseases, cardiac pacing should be
considered, as any degree of fascicular block can progress unpredictably, even in the absence of symptoms (see section 8.5).

5.3.2 Pacing mode and algorithm selection
In intermittent bradycardia, pacing may be required only for short
periods. In this situation, the benefits of bradycardia and pause prevention must be weighed against the detrimental effects of permanent pacing, particularly pacing-induced HF. Low base-rate
programming to achieve backup pacing, and manual adaptation of AV
interval, programming AV hysteresis, or other specific algorithms
preventing unnecessary RV pacing, play a particularly important role
in this patient group. [144][,][148]

In patients in SR, the optimal pacing mode is DDD. The strong evidence of superiority of DDD vs. VVI pacing is limited to improvement
in symptoms and quality of life. Conversely, there is strong evidence
of non-superiority with regard to survival and morbidity. [20]

Therefore, in elderly or frail patients with intermittent bradycardia,
the decision regarding the pacing mode should be made on an individual basis, taking into consideration the increased complication risk
and costs of DDD (Figure 5).
VDD may be a pacing mode alternative for patients with advanced
AV conduction abnormalities and spared sinus node function. In
comparison with DDD, VDD system implantation is associated with
fewer complications, shorter procedure and fluoroscopy times, and a
high incidence of atrial undersensing. [218] Potential atrial undersensing
is contributing to the low use of this system as most operators are
aiming for AV synchrony.

5.4 Pacing for reflex syncope
Permanent pacemaker therapy may be effective if asystole is a dominant feature of reflex syncope. Establishing a relationship between
symptoms and bradycardia should be the goal of the clinical evaluation of patients with syncope and a normal baseline ECG. The efficacy
of pacing depends on the clinical setting. The fact that pacing is effective does not mean it is always necessary. In patients with reflex syncope, cardiac pacing should be the last resort and should only be
considered in highly selected patients [i.e. those >40 years of age
(mostly >60 years), affected by severe forms of reflex syncope with
frequent recurrences associated with a high risk of injury, often without a prodrome]. The 2018 ESC Guidelines on syncope [62] give a
detailed description of the diagnostic pathway and indications for
pacing, and provide the evidence from trials that support such recommendations. Figure 7 summarizes the suggested decision pathway.
The algorithm shown in Figure 7 has been prospectively validated

rate of syncope with pacing of 15% at 2 years, significantly lower
than the 37% rate observed in unpaced controls. [219] The 3-year
recurrence rate was similar in patients with cardioinhibitory carotid
sinus syndrome (16%), asystolic tilt response (23%), and spontaneous asystole documented by ILR (24%), suggesting similar indications and similar results for the three forms of reflex syncope. [220]

Whilst some scepticism prevails over the diagnostic accuracy of tilt
testing for the diagnosis of syncope, emerging evidence supports
the use of tilt testing in the assessment of reflex hypotensive susceptibility. [107][,][221] Thus, tilt testing may be considered to identify
patients with an associated usually antecedent hypotensive
response that would be less likely to respond to permanent cardiac
pacing. Patients with hypotensive susceptibility need measures
directed to counteract hypotensive susceptibility in addition to cardiac pacing (e.g. physical counterpressure manoeuvres, discontinuation/reduction of hypotensive drugs, and administration of
fludrocortisone or midodrine).

5.4.1 Indications for pacing

This Task Force found sufficient evidence in the literature to recom
mend pacing in highly selected patients with reflex syncope (i.e. those
>40 years of age with severe recurrent unpredictable syncopal episodes when asystole has been documented, induced by either CSM
or tilt testing, or recorded through a monitoring system) [133][,][222][�][228]

[(see Supplementary Table 7). There is sufficient evidence that DDD](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
pacing should be considered in order to reduce recurrence of syncope in patients with dominant cardioinhibitory CSS (asystolic pause
>3 s and spontaneous syncope during CSM) and in those in whom
there is a correlation between spontaneous symptoms and ECG
who are >40 years of age and have severe recurrent unpredictable
syncope. [62] Permanent pacemaker therapy may be effective if asystole
is a dominant feature of reflex syncope. Establishing a correlation
between symptoms and bradycardia should be the goal of the clinical
evaluation of patients with syncope and a normal baseline ECG. The
efficacy of pacing depends on the clinical setting. A comparison of
[results in different settings is presented in Supplementary Table 8.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
Since the publication of the 2018 ESC Guidelines on syncope, [62]

some trials have added relevant information regarding the subset of
patients with tilt-induced asystolic vasovagal syncope. The SPAIN trial
was a multicentre, randomized, controlled, crossover study, performed in 46 patients aged >40 years affected by severely recurrent
(>5 episodes during life) syncope and cardioinhibitory tilt test
response (defined as bradycardia <40 b.p.m. lasting >10 s or asystole
>3 s). [226] During the 24-month follow-up, syncope recurred in 4 (9%)
patients treated with a DDD pacemaker with closed loop stimulation

. [...................................................................................]


vs. in 21 (46%) patients who had received a sham pacemaker programmed off (P = 0.0001). In a propensity score-matched comparison study, [229] the 5-year actuarial syncope-free rate was 81% in the
pacing group and 53% in propensity-matched patients (P = 0.005; HR
= 0.25). Finally, the BioSync CLS trial was a multicentre RCT that
investigated the usefulness of the tilt-table test to select candidates
for cardiac pacing. [228] Patients aged >_40 years who had at least two
episodes of unpredictable severe reflex syncope during the past year
and a tilt-induced syncope with an asystolic pause >3 s were randomized to receive either an active (63 patients) or an inactive (64
patients) dual-chamber pacemaker with close loop stimulation. The
study showed that, after a median follow-up of 11.2 months, syncope
occurred in significantly fewer patients in the pacing group than in the
control group [10 (16%) vs. 34 (53%), respectively; HR 0.23; P =
0.00005). This study supports inclusion of tilt testing as a useful
method to select patients with reflex syncope for cardiac pacing.

Based on the results of the above studies, sufficient evidence exists

to upgrade from IIb to I the indication for pacing in patients aged >40
years with asystolic tilt response >3 s. Figure 8 summarizes the recommended indication for pacing. Although there is also a rationale
for pacing in patients aged <_40 years who have the same severity criteria as those >40 years, this Task Force cannot make any recommendation due to the lack of evidence from trials addressing this
specific population.
There is weak evidence that DDD may be useful in reducing recurrences of syncope in patients with the clinical features of adenosinesensitive syncope. [62] In a small multicentre trial performed in 80 highly

selected elderly patients with unexplained unpredictable syncope
who had induction of third-degree AVB of >_10 s to intravenous injection of a bolus of 20 mg of adenosine triphosphate, DDD significantly
reduced the 2-year syncope recurrence rate from 69% in the control
group to 23% in the active group. [230] Finally, cardiac pacing is not indicated in the absence of a documented cardioinhibitory reflex. [231][,][232]

5.4.2 Pacing mode and algorithm selection
Even if the quality of evidence is weak, DDD pacing is widely preferred in clinical practice to single-chamber RV pacing in counteracting blood pressure fall and preventing symptom recurrences. In
patients with tilt-induced vasovagal syncope, DDD was used mostly
with a rate-drop response feature that provides rapid DDD if the
device detects a rapid decrease in heart rate. A comparison between
DDD closed-loop stimulation and conventional DDD has been performed by means of a crossover design in two small studies. Both
studies showed fewer syncope recurrences with closed-loop stimula- . [....................................................]

studies showed fewer syncope recurrences with closed-loop stimulation, both in the acute setting during repeated tilt testing [233] and during 18-month clinical follow-up. [227] However, until a formal parallel
trial is performed, no recommendation can be given regarding the
selection of the pacing mode (i.e. DDD with rate-drop response or
DDD with closed-loop stimulation) and its programming.


5.5.1 Recurrent undiagnosed syncope
In patients with unexplained syncope at the end of a complete workup and absence of any conduction disturbance, the lack of a rationale
and the negative results of small studies [234][,][235] give sufficient evidence
of inefficacy of cardiac pacing. Thus, cardiac pacing is not recommended until a diagnosis is made (Figure 8).

5.5.2 Recurrent falls

Between 15% and 20% of unexplained falls may be syncopal in nature,
possibly bradyarrhythmic. Retrograde amnesia, which is frequent in
the falling elderly, is responsible for misinterpretation of the event. [62]

The management of unexplained falls should be the same as that for
unexplained syncope (see section 5.4.1). In a randomized doubleblind trial, [236] cardiac pacing was ineffective in preventing recurrences
in patients with an unexplained fall in whom carotid sinus hypersensitivity was unable to induce syncope.

The prevalence of HF in the developed world approximates 1�2%
of the adult population, rising to >_10% among people aged >70
years. [237] The prevalence of HF is increasing (by 23% over the past
decade according to one estimate) mainly due to the ageing of the
population, with the age-specific incidence actually declining. [238][�][241]

There are three distinct phenotypes of HF based on the measure
�
ment of LVEF [<40%, HF with reduced EF (HFrEF); 40 49%, HF
with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF); and >_50%, HF with preserved EF
(HFpEF)]. [242] CRT is clinically useful mainly for patients with HFrEF

population with HF, and HFrEF is less prevalent among individuals
aged 70 years or older. The prognosis of HF varies according to the
defined population. In contemporary clinical trials of HFrEF, 1-year
mortality rates of �6% are seen, whereas in large registry-based surveys, 1-year mortality rates exceed 20% in patients recently hospital
ized for HF, but are closer to 6% in those recruited with stable
outpatient HF. [243] The concept of CRT is based on the fact that in
patients with HF and LV systolic dysfunction, high-grade intraventricular conduction delays are frequently observed, with a prevalence of

�
QRS duration >120 ms in 25 50% of patients and of LBBB in
15�27% of cases. Moreover, in such patients, AV dyssynchrony is
also often present with prolonged PR on the surface ECG in up to
52% of cases. [244][�][246] These electrical abnormalities may result in AV,
interventricular, and intra-LV mechanical dyssynchrony. [247][,][248]

Recommendations for CRT are based on the results of the major

RCTs of CRT, most of which have been restricted to the �60% of

HFrEF patients who are in SR. CRT is recommended (in addition to
guideline-directed medical therapy) in only defined subsets of the HF
patient population, the majority being symptomatic HF patients in SR
with a reduced LVEF and a QRS duration >_130 ms. Other smaller

groups that may be considered for CRT include New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class III or IV HF patients in AF with a reduced
LVEF and a QRS duration >_130 ms, provided a strategy to ensure
biventricular capture is in place or the patient is expected to return
to SR, and occasionally as an upgrade from a conventional pacemaker
or an ICD in HFrEF patients who develop worsening HF with a high
rate of ventricular pacing. A recent survey in the USA, which derived
a nationally representative estimate of the entire US population of

�
hospitalized patients, found that over a 10-year period (2003 2012),
there were an estimated 378 247 CRT-D implantations, representing
�40 000 per year, or roughly 135 per million per year. [249] In Europe,
previous estimates have reported that �400 patients per million
population per year might be suitable for CRT. This was based on an
estimated prevalence of 35% for LVEF <_35% in a representative HF
population, of which 41% of patients were estimated to have a QRS
duration >_120 ms. The change to a higher threshold of QRS duration
of 130 ms will reduce these estimates modestly. [250][,][251] In Sweden, a
recent survey of 12 807 HFrEF patients showed that 7% had received

CRT and 69% had no indication for CRT, but 24% had an indication

and had not received CRT. These data highlight the underuse of
CRT. [252][,][253] Finally, the Task Force stresses the point that the decision
to implant CRT requires a shared decision-making with the patient.

6.2 Indication for cardiac
resynchronization therapy: patients in
sinus rhythm
CRT improves cardiac function, symptoms, and well-being, and
reduces morbidity and mortality in an appropriately selected group
of HF patients. CRT also improves quality-adjusted life-years among
patients with moderate to severe HF. The beneficial effects of CRT
have been extensively proven in patients with NYHA class II, III, and
IV. [37][,][39][,][40][,][254][�][266] In contrast, there is rather limited evidence of CRT

benefit in patients with NYHA functional class I and ischaemic cardiomyopathy. [40][,][265] In the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator
Implantation with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT

had an ischaemic cardiomyopathy. At 7-year follow-up, the subgroup
of patients with LBBB, NYHA functional class I, and ischaemic cardiomyopathy showed a non-significant trend towards lower risk of death
from any cause [relative risk 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.30�1.42; P = 0.29]. Therefore, present CRT recommendations are

applicable to all patients in NYHA functional class II IV of any
aetiology.

Heart Failure (CARE-HF) [39][,][261] trials compared the effect of CRT vs.
guideline-directed medical therapy in NYHA functional class III or IV; in
contrast, most recent trials have compared CRT-D with ICD on top
of best medical therapy in NYHA functional class II. [37][,][40][,][262][�][266] Few
studies have compared CRT-pacemaker (CRT-P) with conventional
pacing. [190][,][267][,][268] Most studies of CRT have specified that LVEF should
be <_35%, but MADIT-CRT [40] and the Resynchronization�
Defibrillation for Ambulatory Heart Failure Trial (RAFT) [37] considered
an LVEF <_30%, and the REsynchronization reVErses Remodelling in
Systolic left vEntricular dysfunction (REVERSE) trial [262] specified <_40%.
Relatively few patients with an LVEF of 35�40% have been randomized, but an individual participant data meta-analysis suggests no diminution of the effect of CRT in this group. [33]

Not all patients respond favourably to CRT. Several characteristics
predict reduction in ventricular volume (reverse remodelling) and
improvement in morbidity and mortality. QRS width predicts CRT
response and was the inclusion criterion in all randomized trials (for
[ECG criteria for LBBB and RBBB, see Supplementary Table 1). QRS](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
morphology has been related to a beneficial response to CRT.
Several studies have shown that patients with LBBB morphology are
more likely to respond favourably, whereas there is less certainty
about patients with non-LBBB morphology. Sipahi et al. [269][,][270] performed a meta-analysis in which they examined 33 clinical trials investigating the effect of QRS morphology on CRT, but only four
(COMPANION, CARE-HF, MADIT-CRT, and RAFT) included outcomes according to QRS morphology. When they evaluated the
effect of CRT on composite adverse clinical events in 3349 patients
with LBBB at baseline, they observed a 36% reduction in risk with the
use of CRT (relative risk 0.64, 95% CI 0.52�0.77; P < 0.00001).
However, such benefit was not observed in patients with non-LBBB
conduction abnormalities (relative risk 0.97, 95% CI 0.82�1.15; P <
0.75). When the analysis was limited to trials without ICD (CARE-HF
and COMPANION), the benefit of CRT was still observed only in
patients with LBBB (P < 0.000001). In a meta-analysis excluding
COMPANION and MADIT-CRT, LBBB was not found to be a predictor of mortality, in contrast to QRS duration. [266] In a recent large
meta-analysis of five RCTs (COMPANION, CARE-HF, MADIT-CRT,
RAFT, and REVERSE) including 6523 participants (1766 with nonLBBB QRS morphology), CRT was not associated with a reduction in
death and/or HF hospitalization in patients with non-LBBB QRS morphology (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82- 1.2). [271] As patients have been aggregated in the non-LBBB category in nearly all studies and post-hoc
analyses on the beneficial effect of QRS morphology in CRT, it is not
possible to provide a separate recommendation for CRT in patients
presenting with diffuse intraventricular conduction disturbance and

RBBB. [272][�][277] Patients with RBBB do not benefit from CRT [278] unless
they show a so-called masked LBBB on ECG, [277] characterized by a

broad, slurred, sometimes notched R wave on leads I and aVL,

together with a leftward axis deviation. Individualized positioning of
the LV lead is crucial in these patients.
An important recent notion is the possible role played by a prolonged PR in HF patients with non-LBBB. A few single-centre studies
and two post-hoc analyses of large RCTs (COMPANION and
MADIT-CRT) indicated a potential benefit of implanting CRT in this
patient subgroup. [244][,][279][,][280] In MADIT-CRT, the subgroup of nonLBBB patients who had a prolonged PR did benefit from CRT-D, with

a 73% reduction in the risk of HF or death and an 81% reduction in
the risk of all-cause mortality compared with ICD-only therapy. [279] In
non LBBB patients with normal PR, CRT-D was associated with a
trend towards an increased risk of HF or death and a >2-fold higher
mortality compared with ICD therapy, suggesting a bidirectional significant interaction. However, the data are too limited to give a
recommendation. [279]

The results of the MADIT-CRT, REVERSE, and RAFT trials suggest
that in patients with LBBB, there is likely to be potential benefit in all . [............................................................]


The results of the MADIT-CRT, REVERSE, and RAFT trials suggest
that in patients with LBBB, there is likely to be potential benefit in all
patients with LBBB regardless of QRS duration, and that no cut-off
point can be identified clearly to exclude patients who will not
respond according to the QRS duration. [272][,][273][,][275] In contrast, any
benefit of CRT in patients with non-LBBB is evident mostly in those
with a QRS duration >_150 ms. Importantly, as shown in the MADITCRT long-term study and RAFT, the benefit in patients with QRS
<150 ms appeared later during follow-up. [265][,][273]

The Echocardiography Guided Cardiac Resynchronization
Therapy (Echo-CRT) trial suggested possible harm from CRT when
baseline echocardiographic mechanical dyssynchrony in patients with
QRS duration <130 ms is used. [264][,][281] Therefore, selection of CRT

patients based solely on the use of cardiac imaging data is strongly discouraged in patients with so-called ‘narrow’ QRS (i.e. <130 ms).
Individual patient data pooled from three CRT-D vs. ICD trials
enrolling predominantly patients with NYHA class II HF showed that
women are more likely to respond than men. [282] In the US Food and
Drug Administration meta-analysis of patient-level data, Zusterzeel et
al. [283] found that the main difference occurred in patients with LBBB

�
and a QRS of 130 149 ms. In this group, women had a 76% reduction in HF or death [absolute CRT-D to ICD difference, 23% (HR
0.24, 95% CI 0.11�0.53; P < 0.001)] and a 76% reduction in death
alone [absolute difference 9% (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06�0.89; P =
0.03)], whereas there was no significant benefit in men for HF or
death [absolute difference 4% (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60�1.21; P =
0.38)] or death alone [absolute difference 2% (HR 0.86, 95% CI
0.49�1.52; P = 0.60)]. A possible explanation for the greater benefit

of CRT in women has been attributed to sex difference in LV size, as

sex-specific differences in response disappear when QRS duration is
normalized to LV end-diastolic volume. [284] Recently, computer modelling confirmed that sex differences in the LV size account for a significant proportion of the sex difference in QRS duration, and
provided a possible mechanistic explanation for the sex difference in
CRT response. [285][,][286] Simulations accounting for the smaller LV size
in female CRT patients predict 9 - 13 ms lower QRS duration thresholds for females. As with other ECG parameters (e.g. duration of QT
and corrected QT), it is conceivable that QRS duration also has to

reflect sex difference.


. [...............................................................................................................]


ECG criteria of intraventricular conduction disturbance, LBBB, and

non-LBBB have not been consistently defined and reported in any of
the past CRT studies. [287][,][288] Similarly, the modality of QRS measurement (automatic or manual, and ECG recording machine) was not
reported in CRT studies. However, the selection of ECG criteria
appears to influence hard endpoints. [287][�][290] Similarly, ECG recording
modality and ECG manufacturer have been shown to possibly affect
the automatically measured QRS duration.
Finally, CRT is considered in patients on optimal medical treatment
(OMT), including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonists. However, a study raises the question of the
timing of CRT, because the efficacy of the medical treatment can be
limited in patients with LBBB, suggesting considering CRT sooner. [291]

Moreover, whereas everyday clinical practice supports the use of

�
sacubitril/valsartan, ivabradine, and sodium glucose co-transporter2 inhibitors, it must be emphasized that in the landmark trials
documenting the efficacy of these drugs, very few patients had an
indication for CRT. Thus, there are no strong data to support the
mandatory use of these drugs before considering CRT. [292][�][295]

and reduce the HF hospitalization rate in selected patients. In particular, AF ablation is recommended for reversing LV dysfunction in AF
patients when tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is highly probable, regardless of symptoms. [296] Therefore, CRT should be considered in those patients with persistent AF and HFrEF when AF
ablation cannot be performed or is declined by the patient. With
regard to indications for rate control therapy and in particular to AVJ
ablation, refer to the ESC Guidelines for the management of AF. [296]

6.3.1 Patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure

who are candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy
A major determinant of the success of CRT is the effective delivery
of biventricular pacing. A particular aspect of AF patients is that AF
rhythm with fast ventricular rate and irregularity may interfere with
adequate biventricular pacing delivery. AF may reduce the rate of
effective biventricular capture by creating spontaneous, fusion, or
pseudo-fusion beats. A high rate of biventricular pacing is not reached
in two-thirds of patients with persistent or permanent AF. [297]

Data from large registries show that AF patients undergoing CRT
have an increased risk of mortality even after adjusting for several
clinical variables. [297][�][299] In most AF patients with intact AV conduction, an adequate biventricular pacing delivery can be achieved only
by means of AVJ ablation. [300][�][302] A substudy of the RAFT trial [300] was
unable to show benefit of CRT without AVJ ablation with regard to
the combined endpoint of death or hospitalization for HF; notably,
only 47% of the patients had a biventricular capture >90%. The decision to perform AVJ ablation is still a matter of debate, but most studies have shown improvements in LV function, functional capacity,
exercise capacity, and survival (with the same magnitude as in
patients with SR). [301] Gasparini et al. [302] compared total mortality of
443 AF patients who received AVJ ablation (n = 443) and of 895 AF
patients who received rate-slowing drugs with the mortality of 6046
patients who were in SR. The long-term survival after CRT among
patients with AF and AVJ ablation was similar to that observed among
patients in SR (HR 0.93); the mortality was higher for AF patients
treated with rate-slowing drugs (HR 1.52). The most common ratecontrolling drugs used in AF are beta-blockers; although safe even in
the context of AF and HFrEF, they do not necessarily have the same
benefit as in patients with SR [303] and the benefit�risk ratio is influenced by other cardiovascular comorbidities. [304][,][305] In a systematic
review and meta-analysis, [306] AVJ ablation, compared with no AVJ
ablation, reduced mortality by 37% and reduced the rate of nonresponse by 59% in patients with biventricular pacing <90%, but
showed no benefit in those with >_90% biventricular pacing. Similarly,
Tolosana et al. observed the same rate of responders (defined as
>_10% decrease in end-systolic volume) in AF patients who received
AVJ ablation or rate-slowing drugs and patients in SR who had
adequate biventricular pacing (97, 94, and 97%, respectively). [307]

Importantly, AVJ ablation did not improve survival for patients in AF
treated with CRT compared with those treated with rate-slowing
drugs when an adequate biventricular pacing was achieved either
with ablation (97%) or with drugs (94%). [308] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


In conclusion, despite the weak evidence due to lack of large,
randomized trials, the prevailing opinion of experts is in favour of the
usefulness of CRT in patients with permanent AF and NYHA class III
and IV with the same indications as for patients in SR, provided that
AVJ ablation is added in those patients with incomplete (<90 - 95%)
biventricular capture due to AF (Figure 9). However, there are other
causes for incomplete biventricular pacing such as frequent premature ventricular beats, which may need to be treated (with drugs or
ablation) before considering AVJ ablation. Importantly, evaluation of
the biventricular pacing percentage is mainly given by the percentage
of biventricular pacing using device memory, which does not reflect
exactly the rate of effective biventricular capture. Holter monitoring
may help to assess the real biventricular capture percentage. [309][,][310] A
new algorithm has been developed that can continuously assess the
effective biventricular pacing. [311]

For patients with permanent AF, there are no data supporting the
difference in the magnitude of response to CRT according to the
QRS morphology or a QRS duration cut-off of 150 ms.
It is important to remember that limited data are available for
patients in NYHA class II.

6.3.2 Patients with uncontrolled heart rate who are

candidates for atrioventricular junction ablation
(irrespective of QRS duration)
AVJ ablation should be considered to control heart rate in patients
unresponsive or intolerant to intensive rate and rhythm control therapy, or who are ineligible for AF ablation, accepting that these
patients will become pacemaker dependent. [296] In particular, AVJ
ablation combined with CRT may be preferred to AF ablation in
severely symptomatic patients with permanent AF and at least one
hospitalization for HF. [296]

AVJ ablation and permanent pacing from the RV apex provides
highly efficient rate control and regularization of the ventricular
response in AF, and improves symptoms in selected patients. [192] A
large study with a propensity score-matched control group [194]

showed a 53% reduction in total mortality in patients who underwent
AVJ ablation compared with those treated with pharmacological rate
control therapy. A class IIa indication is provided in the 2020 ESC
Guidelines on AF. [296]

The downside of RV pacing, however, is that it induces LV dyssynchrony in �50% of patients, [312] and that this may lead to worsening of
HF symptoms in a minority. In the majority of patients, AVJ ablation
improves LVEF even with RV apical (RVA) pacing due to amelioration
of tachycardia-induced LV dysfunction, which commonly exists in
these patients. CRT may prevent RV pacing-induced LV dyssynchrony. The multicentre, randomized, prospective Ablate and Pace in
Atrial Fibrillation (APAF) trial [313] included 186 patients in whom a
CRT or RV pacing device was implanted, followed by AVJ ablation.
During a median follow-up of 20 months, CRT significantly reduced
by 63% the primary composite endpoint of death due to HF, hospitalization due to HF, or worsening of HF. The beneficial effects of CRT
were similar in patients with an EF <_35%, NYHA class >_III, and QRS
width >_120 ms, and in other patients with EF>35% or NYHA class
< III or narrow QRS. Compared with the RV pacing group, responders increased from 63% to 83% (P ¼ 0.003). [314] A meta-analysis of
696 patients from five trials showed a 62% reduction in

hospitalization for HF and a modest improvement in LVEF compared
with RV pacing, but not in 6-min walked distance and quality of life
assessed by means of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire. [315] In the APAF-CRT RCT, 102 elderly patients (mean age
72 years) with permanent AF, a narrow QRS (<_110 ms), and at least
one hospitalization for HF in the previous year were randomized to
AVJ ablation and CRT or to pharmacological rate control therapy. [195]

After a median follow-up of 16 months, the primary composite outcome of HF death, hospitalization due to HF, or worsening HF had
occurred in 10 patients (20%) in the ablation (AVJ) plus CRT arm and
in 20 patients (38%) in the drug control arm (HR 0.38; P = 0.013). The
results were mostly driven by a reduction in hospitalization for HF.
The HR was 0.18 (P = 0.01) in patients with LVEF <_35% and 0.62 (P =
0.36) in those with LVEF >35%. Furthermore, patients undergoing AVJ
ablation and CRT had a 36% reduction in the specific symptoms and . [............................................]


physical limitations of AF at 1-year follow-up (P = 0.004). In contrast to
the main composite endpoint, the greatest symptomatic improvements were observed in patients with LVEF >35% (P = 0.0003).

In conclusion, there is evidence from randomized trials of an addi
tional benefit of performing CRT pacing in patients with reduced EF,
who are candidates for AVJ ablation for rate control to reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life. There is evidence that CRT is
superior to RV pacing in relieving symptoms, but not mortality and
hospitalization in patients with mid-range reduced systolic function
(Figure 9).

6.3.3 Emerging novel modalities for CRT: role of
conduction system pacing
HBP, alone or in conjunction with coronary sinus pacing, is a
promising novel technique for delivering CRT, useful in AF patients

ESC Guidelines 37


undergoing AVJ ablation. [198][,][199][,][316][�][318] Non-conventional CRT using
HBP coronary sinus pacing (so-called ‘His-optimized CRT’) or left
bundle branch area pacing, in comparison with conventional CRT,
can achieve a narrower QRS with a ‘quasi-normal’ axis morphology,
echocardiographic improvement of mechanical resynchronization
indexes, and a better short-term clinical outcome. [319][�][321] In general,
the potential benefit of HBP depends on the ability to achieve a
narrow QRS complex that is similar to the native QRS complex,
rather than on the LVEF. Widespread adoption of this technique
relies upon further validation of its efficacy in large RCTs and
improvements in lead design, delivery tools, and devices (see
section 7).

hospitalizations, which may be reduced by programming to maximize
intrinsic conduction or prevented by CRT. [148][,][183][,][190][,][324] Previously,
the benefit of CRT upgrade had been investigated only by observational controlled trials and registries, [325][�][339] mainly comparing upgrade
with de novo CRT; in early, small, observational pre- vs. post-CRT
studies; [340][�][346] and in crossover trials, [347][�][350] providing only limited

clinical outcome data.

Based on a recent meta-analysis of observational studies, mostly
single-centre, [351] echocardiographic and functional response as well
as the risk of mortality or HF events was similar in patients after de
novo vs. upgrade CRT; however, in previous subgroup analyses from
large, randomized, prospective trials such as RAFT, [37] morbidity or
mortality benefit was not confirmed.
Clinical outcomes are also influenced by the clinical characteristics
of patients referred to CRT upgrade. Based on data from the
European CRT Survey II, [352] a high-volume registry, and clinical characteristics from previous studies, [351] patients referred for a CRT
upgrade differ from patients referred for de novo CRT implantation:
they are older (even compared with those in RCTs), mainly male
patients, and have more comorbidities such as AF, ischaemic heart

disease, anaemia, and renal failure.

On average, the number of upgrade procedures reaches 23% of
total CRT implantations, 60% from a conventional device and 40%
from an ICD [352] in ESC countries, showing significant regional differences regarding the type of implanted device, such as CRT-P or
CRT-D. [352][,][353]

Regarding procedure-related complications, several studies
described a higher burden during upgrade procedures, ranging from
6.8% to 20.9% compared with de novo implantations. [339][,][354] This was
not confirmed in a recent analysis of registry data, where upgrades
had similar complication rates to de novo implantations. [352] Notably,
82% of these procedures were performed in high-volume centres.
However, data on the long-term infection rates or lead revisions after
CRT upgrade are scarce. [354][,][355]

The first prospective, randomized trial, the BUDAPEST CRT
Upgrade study, is still ongoing, but may clarify these questions. [356]

6.5 Pacing in patients with reduced left
ventricular ejection fraction and a
conventional indication for
antibradycardia pacing
Three randomized trials proved the superiority of biventricular pacing over RV pacing in patients with moderate to severe systolic dysfunction who required antibradycardia pacing to improve quality of
life, NYHA class, and echocardiographic response. [190][,][357][,][358] In the
Biventricular versus RV pacing in patients with AV block (BLOCK
HF) trial, 691 patients with AVN disease and an indication for pacemaker with a mildly reduced EF (<50% by inclusion criteria, average
42.9% in the pacemaker group) were randomized to biventricular or
RV pacing with or without an ICD, and followed for an average of 37
months. [190] The primary endpoint (a composite of >_15% increase in
the LV end-systolic volume, HF events, or mortality) was significantly
improved in those assigned to CRT. CRT response is high among
patients with systolic dysfunction and expected frequent RV pacing.
Based on the MOde Selection Trial in Sinus-Node Dysfunction
(MOST), [183] at least 40% RV pacing is associated with an increased
risk of HF hospitalization or AF.
For patients with normal or preserved EF, data on benefit of CRT
are conflicting with respect to hospitalization, and no mortality benefit was shown. [166][,][268][,][323][,][359] However, adverse remodelling caused by
RV pacing was prevented by biventricular pacing, especially during
long-term follow up. [323][,][359][,][360] A single-centre study showed that
>20% RV pacing was associated with deleterious LV remodelling in
patients with AVB and preserved LVEF. [188] Frailty should also be
taken into account in deciding on CRT implantation, because of the
higher costs and high complication rates of this procedure.

because no head to head RCTs have been designed to compare

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


over CRT-P by reducing arrhythmic death, it does also add ICDspecific risks such as lead failure and inappropriate shocks, as well as

costs.

COMPANION is the only trial to randomize patients to CRT-P or
CRT-D, but was designed to assess the effects of CRT compared
with OMT. [260] Crucially, it was not designed to compare CRT-D and
CRT-P. CRT-P was associated with a marginally non-significant
reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.76, 95% CI
0.58 - 1.01; P = 0.06), whereas CRT-D was associated with a significant, 36% risk reduction (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48�0.86; P = 0.004).
Analysis of cause-specific mortality showed that SCD was significantly
reduced by CRT-D (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 - 0.86; P = 0.02) but not
CRT-P (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.7�2.07; P = 0.50). [363]

Nevertheless, the CARE-HF extension study proved that CRT-P
alone reduced the risk of dying suddenly by 5.6%. [261] In line with these
findings, subgroup analyses from RCTs in mild HF consistently found
a reduction in ventricular arrhythmias with CRT. [364][�][368] These effects
were especially observed among CRT responders, suggesting that

the reduction in SCD risk is related to the extent of reverse LV

remodelling with CRT.
Meta-analyses have drawn different conclusions on the matter. In
the study by Al-Majed et al., [369] the survival benefit of CRT was largely
driven by a reduction in HF-related mortality, but SCD was not
reduced. Lam et al. [370] showed that CRT-D significantly reduced mortality compared with medical therapy alone [odds ratio (OR) 0.57,
95% CI 0.40�0.80], but not when compared with ICD without CRT

�
(OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.57 1.18) or CRT-P (OR 0.85, 95% CI
0.60�1.22). However, more recently, a network meta-analysis of 13
randomized trials including >12 000 patients found that CRT-D

�
reduced total mortality by 19% (95% CI 1 33%, unadjusted) compared with CRT-P. [275]

Some recent large observational studies highlighted the importance of HF aetiology in the assessment of potential benefits of CRTD over CRT-P. [371][�][373] CRT-D was associated with a significant risk
reduction in all-cause mortality compared with CRT-P in patients
with ischaemic cardiomyopathy. However, this difference was not
found in patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy.
These findings are consistent with the results from the DANISH
study, which assigned 1116 patients with HF and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy to receive either a primary prophylactic ICD or usual
clinical care alone. [374] In both groups, 58% of patients also had CRT.
Subgroup analysis showed that CRT-D was not superior to CRT-P in
reducing the primary outcome of all-cause mortality (HR 0.91, 95%
CI 0.64�1.29; P = 0.59) after a median follow-up of 67.6 months.
However, in a large multicentre registry of >50 000 patients, CRT-D
was associated with a significantly lower observed mortality. [375]

Similar results were found in a recent propensity-matched cohort,
where CRT-D was associated with a significantly lower all-cause
mortality than CRT-P in patients with ischaemic aetiology and in
patients with non-ischaemic HF under 75 years old. [376] Furthermore,
the CeRtiTuDe Cohort study [377] showed better survival in CRT-D
vs. CRT-P mainly due to a reduction of non-SCD. In an Italian multicentre CRT registry, the only independent predictor of mortality was
the lack of an ICD. [378] Whereas these studies are limited by their
observational design, important novel information on the issue of
CRT-D vs. CRT-P is expected to come from an ongoing randomized
trial, Re-evaluation of Optimal Re-synchronisation Therapy in

these two treatments. While CRT-D may further improve survival

ESC Guidelines 39


Patients with Chronic Heart Failure (RESET-CRT; ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier NCT03494933).
In conclusion, prospective randomized trials are lacking, and available data are insufficient to firmly prove a superiority of CRT-D over
CRT-P. However, it is important to consider that CRT trials in mild
HF almost exclusively included patients with an ICD, [37][,][40][,][262] and that
survival benefit of CRT without an ICD is uncertain in this particular
group. Furthermore, observational data point towards significant survival benefits by CRT-D over CRT-P in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, while no clear benefit has been shown in those with
non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy.
Further predictive power concerning the risk of ventricular
arrhythmia may be derived by contrast-enhanced CMR-guided scar
characterization. [379][,][380] When discussing the choice between CRT-D
and CRT-P, it is particularly important to consider general predictors
of ICD effectiveness such as age and comorbidities associated with a
mortality risk that competes with sudden arrhythmic death. Thus, the
addition of ICD to CRT should be considered, especially in younger
patients with a good survival prognosis, ischaemic aetiology, and a
favourable comorbidity profile or presence of myocardial fibrosis
(Figure 10). Moreover, the benefit of the ICD is governed by the bal
ance between the risk of SCD and the risk of death from other

causes, as well as comorbidities. Generally, the rate of sudden
arrhythmic death in primary prevention appears to be declining (1%/
year).
Owing to the complexity of the matter and the lack of clear evidence, it is particularly important that the choice between CRT-P
and CRT-D is guided by a process of shared decision-making
between patients and clinicians, taking into account both medical
facts and patient values.

6.7 Factors influencing the efficacy of
cardiac resynchronization therapy: role
of imaging techniques
The role of cardiac imaging in selecting HF patients for CRT has
been evaluated mostly in observational analyses. Cardiac dyssynchrony, [384][�][386] myocardial scar, [387][,][388] and site of latest activation . [.........................................................................................................................................................................]


of the LV in relation to the LV lead position [389][,][390] have been associated with response to CRT. LVEF is the only parameter included in
the guidelines for the selection of patients for CRT and is key to

�
define the type of HF (<40%, HFrEF; 40 49%, HFmrEF; and >_50%,
HFpEF). [242] Echocardiography is the imaging technique of first choice

for the assessment of LVEF. However, when intravenous contrast is

not available and the acoustic window does not allow accurate

assessment of LVEF, CMR or nuclear imaging should be considered. [242] Strain imaging (based on echocardiography or CMR) to
quantify LV systolic function has shown incremental prognostic value
in HF, and allows assessment of LV mechanical dyssynchrony. [384][,][391][�][393] CMR with LGE techniques (which show the
presence of myocardial scar tissue) provide the best resolution to differentiate ischaemic cardiomyopathy and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. [394] The location (posterolateral) and extent (transmural vs.
non-transmural and percentage of LV mass) of LGE on CMR or with
nuclear techniques has been associated with the benefit from
CRT. [380][,][387][,][395][,][396] Severe mitral regurgitation, [397] lack of significant
electromechanical LV dyssynchrony, [384][,][385][,][392] and RV systolic dysfunction [398] have been associated with less improvement in clinical
symptoms and reduced survival after CRT. Several imaging techniques have been tested to assess LV mechanical dyssynchrony, but
most measures of LV dyssynchrony have not been tested in randomized trials including patients with HFrEF and wide QRS. [399] The presence of septal flash and apical rocking, [400] time differences based on
radial strain and patterns of regional longitudinal strain, [384][,][392][,][401][�][403]

non-invasive and invasive ECG mapping, [385][,][404] and vector-cardiography [405] have been proposed as novel techniques to predict response
to CRT. Furthermore, LV myocardial work assessed with speckletracking echocardiography has been associated with survival in CRT
recipients. [406] Coronary sinus venography is commonly performed to
detect a suitable coronary vein in which to deploy an LV lead.
Randomized trials have not systematically demonstrated that the
guidance of LV lead implantation based on imaging (assessing myocardial scar or site of latest activation) is superior to standard practice. [389][,][390][,][407][,][408] Initial experience on using artificial intelligence to
combine clinical, electrical, and imaging parameters to define phenotypes of patients that will benefit from CRT is promising, but more
data are needed. [409]

Significant (moderate to severe and severe) secondary mitral
regurgitation is frequent among candidates for CRT and has been
shown to affect long-term survival as well as response to therapy. [406][,][410] CRT can improve mitral regurgitation in as many as 40% of
patients. [406] However, in 60% of patients, significant mitral regurgitation is not corrected and, at long-term follow-up, progression of the
underlying disease may lead to further deterioration of mitral valve
function and poor prognosis. Transcatheter edge-to-edge mitral
valve repair has been demonstrated to improve the response to CRT
in registries. [411][�][414] However, results from recent RCTs including
patients with symptomatic severe secondary mitral regurgitation
despite guideline-directed medical therapy (including CRT when indicated) have not consistently shown a benefit from transcatheter
edge-to-edge mitral valve repair. [415][,][416]

Therefore, selection of patients for CRT based on imaging is lim

### 7 Alternative pacing strategies and sites

Alternative RV pacing sites (as opposed to RVA pacing) include pacing from the RV outflow tract (RVOT), the mid and high RV septum
(RVS), HBP, para-Hisian pacing, and left bundle branch area pacing,
which includes LV septal pacing and left bundle branch pacing.

7.1 Septal pacing
Since the 2013 ESC Guidelines, [33] two randomized trials found no dif
ference in clinical outcomes between RVS and RVA pacing in the setting of AVB [417] or CRT, [418] respectively. A meta-analysis reported an
echocardiographic benefit of RVS pacing in patients with pre-existing
reduced LVEF. [419] In an observational study, RVS pacing was associated with a lower risk of perforation. [420] However, true RVS pacing is
not easily obtained and ascertained, [421] and neither beneficial nor
harmful effects of RVS pacing compared with RVA pacing have been
[shown on relevant clinical endpoints (Supplementary Table 9).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
Current evidence does not support systematically recommending

7.2 His bundle pacing
HBP was first reported in humans in 2000, [199] and is steadily gaining
interest for providing a more physiological alternative to RV pacing. It
may also correct intraventricular conduction delay in a subset of
patients, thereby providing an alternative to biventricular pacing for
treating HF. The advent of new tools has greatly facilitated implantation, which has become routine in a growing number of centres. HBP
is used in lieu of RV pacing, in lieu of biventricular pacing, and as Hisoptimized CRT (HOT-CRT), [319] which exploits a synergistic effect
between HBP and RV pacing, LV pacing, or biventricular pacing to
improve synchrony. There is growing evidence, mainly from observational studies, that HBP may be safe and effective in these settings
[(Supplementary Table 10), although large RCTs and long-term follow-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
up are still lacking. [422] With more data on safety and effectiveness,
HBP is likely to play a growing role in pacing therapy in the future.

7.2.1 Implantation and follow-up
The use of guiding catheters to deliver leads has facilitated implantation, with success rates exceeding 80%. [422] In an international registry,
implant success was 87% after a learning curve of 40 cases. [423]

Selective HBP is easily recognized by an isoelectric interval (corresponding to the HV) between the pacing spike and QRS onset,
whereas with non-selective HBP, a ‘pseudo-delta’ wave is observed
due to capture of local myocardium. [424] In addition, correction of BBB
may be observed (Figure 11). It is important to distinguish nonselective HBP from para-Hisian pacing (where there is no capture of
conduction tissue) by evaluating transitions in QRS morphology by
reducing pacing output or with pacing manoeuvres. [425]

### 7 Alternative pacing strategies and sites


Alternative RV pacing sites (as opposed to RVA pacing) include pacing from the RV outflow tract (RVOT), the mid and high RV septum
(RVS), HBP, para-Hisian pacing, and left bundle branch area pacing,
which includes LV septal pacing and left bundle branch pacing.


7.1 Septal pacing
Since the 2013 ESC Guidelines, [33] two randomized trials found no dif
ference in clinical outcomes between RVS and RVA pacing in the setting of AVB [417] or CRT, [418] respectively. A meta-analysis reported an
echocardiographic benefit of RVS pacing in patients with pre-existing

Current evidence does not support systematically recommending
either RVS or RVA pacing for all patients.

fare better in terms of HF hospitalizations than patients with RV pacing if the percentage of ventricular pacing is >20% (HR 0.54; P =
0.01). [42] Of note, the average baseline LVEF in patients with HBP in
that study was 55% and the average QRS duration was 105 ms. HBP
may therefore avoid clinical deterioration in these patients, particularly if the intrinsic QRS is narrow or if BBB is corrected by HBP.
In a series of 100 patients with AVB undergoing HBP by experienced operators, implantation was successful in 41/54 (76%) patients
with infranodal AVB and higher in the case of nodal block (93%; P <
0.05). [433] Over a mean follow-up of 19 ± 12 months, lead revision
was necessary in 2/41 (5%) patients with infranodal block and in 3/43
(7%) with nodal block. Notably, the average LVEF in this series was
54%, and there are no data reported specifically on HBP in patients
with AVB and reduced LVEF. HBP is an option in patients with a narrow QRS or if HBP corrects BBB, but otherwise biventricular pacing

is indicated.

There is a need for RCTs to compare the safety and efficacy of
HBP with RV pacing. It is important to balance the potential benefits
of HBP with the aforementioned issues of higher capture thresholds
and shorter battery longevity, a higher rate of lead revision, and more
frequent sensing issues, compared with RV pacing. It is also important
to consider the operator’s experience and expertise with HBP, and
whether a backup ventricular pacing lead is indicated. The patient’s
safety should be first and foremost in decision-making.

7.2.2.2 Pace and ablate

Seven observational series, totalling >240 patients treated with a
‘pace-and-ablate’ strategy for rapidly conducted AF, found an
improvement in LVEF and NYHA class compared with baseline with
HBP. [197][�][199][,][434] Long-term results with a median of 3 years of followup have been reported, with favourable outcomes. [434] A singleblinded, randomized, crossover study in 16 patients compared HBP
with RVA pacing over 6 months and found better NYHA and 6-min
walk distance with HBP, without differences in echocardiographic
parameters. [200] However, only four patients in this study had confirmed HBP (with para-Hisian pacing in the remaining patients).
These studies included patients with reduced as well as preserved
LVEF, [197][,][198] and QRS width was on average <120 ms. HBP is of particular interest in patients with a normal baseline QRS morphology as
it preserves intrinsic ventricular synchrony, However, a caveat is that
AVJ ablation may result in an increase in HBP capture thresholds or
in lead dislodgments in a minority of patients. [197][,][199][,][318][,][426] Owing to
these issues and risk of HBP lead failure, a backup RV lead should be

considered.

7.2.2.3 Role in cardiac resynchronization therapy
In 1977, Narula showed that pacing of the His bundle can correct
LBBB in a subset of patients, implying a proximal site of conduction
disturbance with longitudinal dissociation within the His bundle. [435] A
recent mapping study reported intra-Hisian block in 46% of patients
with LBBB, in whom 94% were corrected by temporary HBP. [436] HBP
may therefore be used in lieu of biventricular pacing for HBP-based
CRT, as some data have shown that results are comparable (see
[Supplementary Table 10).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data) [437][�][439] Nevertheless, especially in CRT candidates with LBBB, biventricular pacing has more solid evidence of
efficacy and safety, and therefore remains first-line therapy. However,

HBP should be considered as a bailout solution in the case of failed


Table 9 Advantages and disadvantages of a ‘backup’
ventricular lead with His bundle pacing

HBP = His bundle pacing; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; RBBB = right bun
dle branch block.

Compared with RV pacing, HBP capture thresholds are on average
higher and sensing amplitudes lower. A recent observational study
raised concern with regard to increasing HBP pacing thresholds with
intermediate follow-up. [426] The higher capture thresholds lead to
shorter battery longevity (at 5 years there were 9% generator
changes with HBP compared with 1% with RVP). [427] Capture thresholds of HBP at implantation should aim to be <2.0 V/1 ms (or <2.5 V/
0.4 ms) and bipolar R-wave sensing amplitude >2.0 mV. With experience, thresholds decrease as implanters gain confidence to reposition
leads. Sensing issues include not only ventricular undersensing, but
also oversensing of atrial or His potentials (which may be potentially
lethal in a pacemaker-dependent patient).
An RV backup lead should be considered if the implanter is inexperienced, or if there are high capture thresholds or sensing issues in
pacemaker-dependent patients, in those scheduled for AVN ablation
(where there is a risk of compromising HBP), or in patients with highdegree or infranodal block. Pros and cons are listed in Table 9.

Several series have shown that the rate of mid-term lead revision
is relatively high at �7%, [318][,][423][,][427][,][428] (and reported to be as high as
11% [426] ), and is higher than RV pacing, which is 2�3%. [427][,][429]

Therefore, it is advisable to follow-up these patients at least once
every 6 months or place them on remote monitoring (ensuring that
automatic threshold measurements correspond to those measured
manually, as this may not be the case and depends on device configuration). [430] Device programming should take into account specific
requirements for HBP, which are covered in detail elsewhere. [431][,][432]

7.2.2 Indications

7.2.2.1 Pacing for bradycardia
One study reported that in patients with AVB and normal baseline
LVEF, the incidence of RV pacing-induced cardiomyopathy was
12.3% and the risk was increased if the percentage of ventricular pacing was >_20% (HR 6.76; P = 0.002). [188] However, there are no data to
support that any percentage of RV pacing can be considered as defining a true limit below which RV pacing is safe and beyond which RV
pacing is harmful. Observational data indicate that patients with HBP

LV lead implantation along with other options such as surgical epicardial leads [424][,][440] (see section 6.7). An interesting population is patients
with RBBB, who are known to respond less well to biventricular pacing, in whom HBP has shown promising preliminary results in a series
of 37 patients. [441] HBP may sometimes incompletely correct BBB, and
can be used in conjunction with RV, LV, or biventricular pacing, as in
the HOT-CRT study. [319] This is of particular interest in patients with
permanent AF, in whom a His lead may be connected to the vacant
atrial port, thus offering additional therapeutic options.

7.3 Left bundle branch area pacing
With left bundle branch area pacing, the lead is implanted slightly distal to the His bundle and is screwed deep in the LV septum, ideally to
capture the left bundle branch. [442] Advantages of this technique are
that electrical parameters are usually excellent, it may be successful

in blocks that are too distal to be treated with HBP, and it also facili
tates AVJ ablation, which may be challenging with HBP. However,
although the technique is very promising, data on this modality are
[still scarce (Supplementary Table 11), and there is concern regarding](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
long-term lead performance and feasibility of lead extraction.
Recommendations for using left bundle branch area pacing cannot
therefore be formulated at this stage. However, conduction system
pacing (which includes HBP and left bundle branch area pacing) is
very likely to play a growing role in the future, and the current recommendations will probably need to be revised once more solid evidence of safety and efficacy (from randomized trials) is published. A
comparison of RV pacing, HBP, and left bundle branch area pacing is

7.4 Leadless pacing
Leadless pacemakers have been developed to address limitations typically related to pulse generator pocket and transvenous leads of conventional pacemaker systems. Currently, two leadless pacemaker
systems have been studied in clinical trials, of which one is currently
available for clinical use. Both are inserted into the RV cavity by a femoral venous approach using a specially designed catheter-based deliv
ery system.
A number of prospective registries have reported that implantation success rates are high, with adequate electrical results both at
[implant and at follow-up (Supplementary Table 13). ‘Real-world’](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
results of one leadless pacemaker system, including 1817 patients,
reported serious adverse events in 2.7% of patients. [50] The prevalence
of leadless device infections is low as the principal sources of infection
(i.e. the subdermal surgical pocket and pacemaker leads) are absent.
However, during the initial operator experience, there was a higher
incidence of peri-operative major complications (6.5%), including
perforation and tamponade, vascular complications, ventricular
arrhythmias, and death. [445] These data highlight the importance of
adequate training and supervision in this domain when starting with
leadless pacemaker implantation. In addition, implanting physicians
should have the same competency and accreditation as those
required for standard transvenous pacing to be able to offer the most
suitable system for a given patient. Implantation of leadless pacemakers should be performed in an adequate setting (i.e. with highresolution multiplane fluoroscopy) and with cardiac surgery available
on site due to the risk of tamponade, which may be more difficult to
manage than with standard pacing. [446][,][447]

Leadless pacemakers that only function in the VVI(R) mode
restrict indications to patients with AF or very infrequent pacing (e.g.
paroxysmal AVB). Recently, VDD pacing (by detection of atrial contraction by the accelerometer) has been introduced, which extends
indications to patients with AVB with preserved sinus node function.

�
AV synchrony is maintained 70 90% of the time, depending on the
patient’s position and activity, based on data from two studies including 73 patients in SR and high-degree AV block. [448] There may in
future be an alternative to standard DDD pacemakers in selected
patients if the potential benefits of leadless pacing outweigh the
potential benefits of 100% AV synchrony, atrial pacing, and atrial
arrhythmia monitoring.
Indications for leadless pacemakers include obstruction of the
venous route used for standard pacemaker implantation (e.g. bilateral
venous thoracic outlet syndrome or chronic obstruction of the superior vena cava), pocket issues (e.g. in the case of cachexia or dementia), or particularly increased infection risk [e.g. in the case of dialysis

infection]. Observational data showed that a leadless pacemaker was
a safe pacing alternative in patients with previous device infection and
explant, and in patients on chronic haemodialysis. Whereas observational data indicate high efficacy and low complication rates with leadless pacemakers, [50] there are currently no data from RCTs
documenting the long-term safety and efficacy of leadless vs. standard
transvenous pacemakers, and therefore the indication for a leadless
pacemaker should be carefully considered on a case by case basis.
The absence of long-term data on leadless pacemaker performance
and limited data on retrievability and end-of-life strategy [449] require
careful consideration before selecting leadless pacemaker therapy,
especially for younger patients (e.g. with a life expectancy >20 years).

recommended in patients with AVB who have not yet received
reperfusion therapy. [469] AVB may require temporary pacing in the
presence of refractory symptoms or haemodynamic compromise,
but most often resolves spontaneously within a few days and only a
minority of patients require permanent pacing. [451][,][454][,][456][,][458][,][462] In
patients with persistent intraventricular conduction abnormalities
and transient AVB in whom permanent pacing was recommended in
the past, there is no evidence that permanent cardiac pacing
improves outcome. [454][,][470] These patients frequently have HF and
poor LV function, and should be evaluated for ICD, CRT-P, or CRTD rather than conventional pacing if an early device implantation is
considered. [471]

If AVB does not resolve within 10 days, a permanent pacemaker
should be implanted. In the absence of robust scientific data, the waiting period before pacemaker implantation has to be decided individually. It may last up to 10 days but can be shortened to 5 days
depending on the occluded vessel, time delay, and success of revascularization. Conditions favouring consideration of earlier pacemaker
implantation include unsuccessful or late revascularization, anterior
MI, bifascicular block or AV block before MI, and progression of AV
block within the first days after MI. Sick sinus syndrome after occlusion of the right coronary artery resolves in most cases. If revascularization is incomplete, pacemaker implantation can usually still be
postponed and implantation only be performed if symptoms due to
sinus bradycardia persist.

### 8 Indications for pacing in specific conditions

8.1 Pacing in acute myocardial infarction
In patients with acute MI, significant bradyarrhythmia may occur
due to autonomic influences or damage of the conduction system
by ischaemia and/or reperfusion. The right coronary artery supplies

the sinus node in 60% and the AVN and His bundle in 90%
of patients. [451][,][452] AVB is located above the His bundle in most
patients with inferior infarction, but is usually infra-Hisian and preceded by intraventricular conduction disturbances in anterior
infarction. [451][,][453][�][457]

The incidence of high-degree AVB in patients with ST-segment elevation MI has declined to 3�4% in the primary percutaneous coronary intervention era. [458][�][460] High-degree AVB is most frequent in
inferior or inferolateral infarctions. [455][,][458][�][461]

Patients with high-degree AVB have higher clinical risk and
larger infarctions especially when AVB complicates an anterior
infarction. [458][�][460][,][462][,][463] New-onset intraventricular conduction disturbance is also associated with larger infarctions. [464][�][467]

8.2 Pacing after cardiac surgery and
heart transplantation
8.2.1 Pacing after coronary artery bypass graft and
valve surgery

�
AVB may occur in 1 4% of cases after cardiac surgery and in
�8% after repeat valve surgery. [472][�][476] SND may occur after right
lateral atriotomy or transseptal superior approaches to the mitral
valve. [473][,][474]

ESC Guidelines 45


Pacemaker implantation is more frequent after valvular than after
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. [477] In clinical practice,

�
an observation period of 3 7 days is usually applied before implanting a permanent pacemaker [473] to allow regression of transient bradycardias. The ideal timing of pacemaker implantation after cardiac
surgery remains a topic of controversy, due to the fact that 60�70%
of patients implanted for SND and up to 25% of those implanted for
AVB are not pacemaker dependent at follow-up. [473][,][478] In the case of
complete AVB occurring within the first 24 h after valvular surgery
and persisting for 48 h, resolution within the next 1�2 weeks is
unlikely and earlier implantation of a pacemaker may be considered. [479][,][480] The same approach appears reasonable for complete
AVB with a low rate of escape rhythm. [473] The situation in CHD surgery and in children may be different (see section 8.4).
In valvular endocarditis, predictors of AVB after surgery are preoperative conduction abnormalities, Staphylococcus aureus infection,
intracardiac abscess, tricuspid valve involvement, and previous valvular surgery. [481] In patients with endocarditis and peri-operative AVB,
early pacemaker implantation is reasonable, especially when one or
more predicting factors are present. In light of the infected state of
the patient, intra-operative implantation of an epicardial pacemaker
system during valvular surgery may be reasonable despite the
absence of solid data on infection rates of epicardial vs. transvenous
pacemaker systems.

8.2.2 Pacing after heart transplantation
SND is common and leads to permanent pacemaker implantation
after heart transplantation in 8% of patients. [473] Possible causes of
SND include surgical trauma, sinus node artery damage, or ischaemia
and prolonged cardiac ischaemic times. [482][,][483] AVB is less common,
and is probably related to inadequate preservation of the donor
heart. [473][,][483][,][484] Chronotropic incompetence is always present following standard orthotopic heart transplantation, as a result of loss
of autonomic control. As sinus node and AVN function improve during the first few weeks after transplantation, an observation period
before pacemaker implantation may allow spontaneous improvement of bradycardia. [485] There is general consensus that patients in
whom symptomatic bradycardia persists after the third postoperative week may require permanent pacemaker implantation.
DDD(R) mode with minimized ventricular pacing in the case of intact
AVN conduction is recommended. [483]

8.2.3 Pacing after tricuspid valve surgery
An underestimated aspect of the surgical management of tricuspid
valve disease is to address trans-tricuspid pacemaker or ICD leads.
Such leads can interfere with the function of a repaired tricuspid valve
or tricuspid valve prosthesis.
Placing an epicardial RV lead at the time of tricuspid valve surgery

or third-degree AVB. There have been doubts about the long-term
performance of epicardial leads, but recent data indicate, at least for
epicardial LV leads, performance comparable with transvenous
leads. [486]

Ventricular pacing after mechanical tricuspid valve replacement
using a coronary sinus lead appears safe and feasible, but only results
from small patient cohorts have been published. Procedural success
of implantation was 100% in 23 patients; after 5.3 ± 2.8 years, 96% of
leads were functional with stable pacing and sensing parameters. [487]

HBP is emerging as a more physiological method of ventricular
pacing and may evolve into a possible solution in patients with AV
conduction disease after tricuspid valve surgery. One study investigating 30 patients with HBP after cardiac valve operations reported
successful permanent HBP in 93% of these patients. [488] This study
included 10 patients with tricuspid valve annuloplasty.
After replacement by a mechanical valve, transvalvular lead
placement is contraindicated, and implanting either a coronary
sinus lead for ventricular pacing or epicardial leads, which may be
placed minimally invasively, is recommended. To avoid damaging a
repaired tricuspid valve or a tricuspid bioprosthesis, the optimal
solution in patients needing ventricular pacing after such surgery
should not include transvalvular lead implantation. Implanting a coronary sinus lead for ventricular pacing or minimally invasively
placed epicardial leads is judged to be the preferred choice.
However, as indicated in observational reports, transvalvular lead
implantation was used with acceptable results, [489] and still may be
considered in selected patients after tricuspid valve annuloplasty,
other types of repair, and replacement of a tricuspid valve by a
bioprosthesis.
Performing tricuspid valve replacement in a patient with an existing RV lead, removal of the old RV lead and implantation of an epicardial RV lead should be preferred over sewing in the existing lead
between a bioprosthesis and annulus. The reasons are that sewing
in the lead may be associated with higher risk of lead failure and, in
the case of future need for lead extraction, such a procedure is
likely to require open heart surgery, which will be a reintervention
with higher operative risk. In cases of tricuspid valve repair with a
current annuloplasty ring with an open segment and without concomitant leaflet procedures, an existing RV lead may be left in place
without sewing it in between the ring and the annulus. However, even
in isolated annuloplasty procedures, an existing RV lead should
ideally be removed to avoid future lead-related complications to
the repaired tricuspid valve and an epicardial RV lead should be
implanted. Particularly in patients not in need of a dual-chamber
device, the use of a leadless pacemaker for ventricular pacing may
serve as a feasible future alternative after tricuspid valve repair or
replacement by a bioprosthesis. However, experience is very limited, and no long-term data are available in this cohort. Crossing a
mechanical tricuspid valve with the delivery sheath and a leadless
pacemaker is contraindicated.


8.2.2 Pacing after heart transplantation
SND is common and leads to permanent pacemaker implantation
after heart transplantation in 8% of patients. [473] Possible causes of
SND include surgical trauma, sinus node artery damage, or ischaemia
and prolonged cardiac ischaemic times. [482][,][483] AVB is less common,
and is probably related to inadequate preservation of the donor
heart. [473][,][483][,][484] Chronotropic incompetence is always present following standard orthotopic heart transplantation, as a result of loss
of autonomic control. As sinus node and AVN function improve during the first few weeks after transplantation, an observation period
before pacemaker implantation may allow spontaneous improvement of bradycardia. [485] There is general consensus that patients in
whom symptomatic bradycardia persists after the third postoperative week may require permanent pacemaker implantation.
DDD(R) mode with minimized ventricular pacing in the case of intact
AVN conduction is recommended. [483]


8.2.3 Pacing after tricuspid valve surgery
An underestimated aspect of the surgical management of tricuspid
valve disease is to address trans-tricuspid pacemaker or ICD leads.
Such leads can interfere with the function of a repaired tricuspid valve
or tricuspid valve prosthesis.
Placing an epicardial RV lead at the time of tricuspid valve surgery
is the most straightforward alternative in cases with type II second

8.3 Pacing after transcatheter aortic
valve implantation
For extended literature on patients with pre-procedural RBBB and
post-procedural LBBB see sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 in the
[Supplementary data.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
Rates of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI range
between 3.4% and 25.9% in randomized trials and large registries. [490][�][502] Whereas the association between pacing after TAVI and
outcome is controversial, [503][�][509] RV pacing may lead to deterioration
in LV function. [183][,][510][,][511] Thus, efforts to minimize unnecessary permanent pacing are warranted.
[Predictors for permanent pacing (Table 10 and supplementary table](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
[14), especially RBBB, which has been identified as the most consistent](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
and powerful predictor for permanent pacemaker implantation,
should be incorporated into procedural planning including transcatheter heart valve selection, implantation height, and balloon inflations.
Patients with pre-existing advanced conduction system disease
who may have an indication for permanent pacing irrespective of the
TAVI procedure need consultation with an electrophysiologist
before the procedure. There is currently no evidence to support permanent pacemaker implantation as a ‘prophylactic’ measure before
TAVI in asymptomatic patients or in patients who do not meet the
standard indications for pacemaker implantation.
A recommended approach for the management of conduction
abnormalities after TAVI is detailed in Figure 12. Patients without new
conduction disturbances post-TAVI are at very low risk of developing
high-degree AVB. [533][�][535] Conversely, management of patients with
persistent complete or high-degree AVB should follow standard
guidelines. Permanent pacemaker implantation appears warranted in
patients with intraprocedural AVB that persists for 24- 48 h after
TAVI or appears later. Data to guide the management of patients
with other conduction abnormalities at baseline or post-procedure

are more limited.

Given the close anatomical proximity of the aortic valve and the
left bundle branch, the most frequent conduction abnormality after
TAVI is new-onset LBBB. [504][,][536][�][538] Only a small minority of these
patients require pacemaker implantation. [536][,][537] Thus, EPS [539][�][541] or
long-term monitoring [536] in lieu of pacemaker implantation may be
considered [542][,][543] [(see section 8 in the Supplementary data). Several](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
high-risk subgroups of patients with new LBBB have been identified
[(see Figure 12, and section 8 in the Supplementary data). In such](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
patients with dynamic progression of conduction abnormalities after
TAVI (new BBB with dynamic prolongation of QRS and/or PR), an
extended monitoring period in hospital of up to 5 days should be
considered. Conversely, patients with new-onset LBBB but QRS

8.4. Cardiac pacing and cardiac
resynchronization therapy in congenital
heart disease

Permanent pacing in patients with moderate or complex CHD
should be performed in centres with a multidisciplinary team and
expertise in CHD-related device therapy. Generally, decision-making . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


for pacemaker therapy in patients with CHD is based on expert con
sensus and individual evaluation due to lack of evidence from RCTs.

In the presence of an intracardiac shunt between the systemic and
pulmonary circulation, endovascular lead placement is relatively contraindicated due to the risk of arterial embolism. [551]

The clinical presentation may vary considerably; even severe bradycardia in congenital AVB may remain oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic. Periodic Holter recordings may be useful for patients at
specific risk of bradyarrhythmia.

8.4.1 Sinus node dysfunction and

�
bradycardia tachycardia syndrome
There is no evidence that SND directly leads to increased mortality
in CHD. However, it may be associated with a higher rate of postoperative atrial flutter, with 1:1 AV conduction in CHD, and thus lead
to morbidity and potentially mortality. [552][,][553]

8.4.1.1 Indications for pacemaker implantation
In patients with symptomatic chronotropic incompetence, pacemaker implantation is justified when other causes (see section 4) have
been ruled out. [554][,][555] Increasing the heart rate through permanent
pacing to prevent atrial arrhythmias may be considered. [556] The
underlying evidence is weak, as the benefit of atrial-based pacing
observed in patients without structural heart disease could not be
validated in CHD. [21][,][557][,][558] The general consensus is that if permanent
pacing is necessary, single-lead atrial-based pacing should be preferred to limit the number of leads, especially in young patients with
adequate AV conduction. [559] In patients with congenitally corrected
transposition of the great arteries requiring ventricular pacing
because of high-degree AVB, CRT should be considered. Current
evidence to use devices with atrial antitachycardia pacing to treat
intra-atrial re-entrant tachycardias in patients with CHD [560][,][561] is too
limited to make general recommendations.

8.4.2 Congenital atrioventricular block
A number of maternal or fetal factors can cause congenital heart
block, particularly autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus eryth[ematosus and Sjo¨gren syndrome (Supplementary Table 16).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
Patients presenting with congenital AVB may be asymptomatic or
may present with reduced exercise capacity, syncopal attacks, congestive HF, ventricular dysfunction, and dilatation. Rarely, in SCD,
congenital AVB is diagnosed as the cause. [562][,][563] SCD may occur
through increased propensity to develop bradycardia-related ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades-de-pointes.

8.4.2.1 Indications for pacemaker implantation
There is general consensus that prophylactic pacing is indicated in
asymptomatic patients with any of the following risk factors: mean
daytime heart rate <50 b.p.m., pauses greater than three times
the cycle length of the ventricular escape rhythm, a broad QRS
escape rhythm, prolonged QT interval, or complex ventricular
ectopy. [564][�][566] Clinical symptoms, such as syncope, pre-syncope, HF,
or chronotropic incompetence, are indications for pacemaker
implantation. [564][,][567][,][568] If ventricular dysfunction is attributed to haemodynamic compromise caused by bradycardia, permanent pacing
may be indicated. [518][,][567] Despite a modest quality of evidence, there

resynchronization therapy in congenital
heart disease

Permanent pacing in patients with moderate or complex CHD
should be performed in centres with a multidisciplinary team and
expertise in CHD-related device therapy. Generally, decision-making

ESC Guidelines 49


is strong consensus that patients with third- or second-degree AVB
(Mobitz type II) must receive permanent cardiac pacing therapy if
symptomatic or with risk factors. In asymptomatic patients without
risk factors, opinion on the benefit of cardiac pacing diverges, and
permanent pacing may be considered. [567][,][569]

8.4.3 Post-operative atrioventricular block
Post-operative high-degree AVB is estimated to occur in 1�3% of
patients undergoing surgery for CHD. [518][,][569][,][570] In children, transient
early post-operative AVB usually resolves within 7�10 days. [571] In
adults with CHD, there are no data to support a different waiting
period before deciding for permanent pacing post-operatively than
after other cardiac surgery. After recovery from complete AVB, bifascicular block occasionally persists, which is associated with an
increased risk of late recurrent AVB and sudden death. [572] The prognosis is poor for patients with untreated post-operative complete
AVB. [573]

8.4.3.1 Indications for pacemaker implantation
There is a strong recommendation for permanent pacing in patients
with persistent second- or third-degree AVB. In patients with persistent bifascicular block associated with transient AVB or permanent
prolonged PR interval, consensus for pacemaker implantation is modest. Post-operative HV interval determination may help to estimate
the risk in patients with prolonged PR or bifascicular block. [573] In
patients with bifascicular block and long PR after surgery for CHD,
the risk of extensive damage to the conduction system is high, [572]

therefore pacemaker implantation may be indicated even without
HV measurement. Implantation of epicardial leads should be considered during surgery in patients with complex CHD and a high lifetime
risk of pacemaker implantation, in order to reduce the rate of

reoperation.

8.4.4 Cardiac resynchronization
Standard indications for CRT may be considered in CHD, taking into
account that the anatomy, morphology of the systemic ventricle, and
cause of dyssynchrony, as well as QRS morphology, may be atypical. [574] Multidisciplinary teams in experienced centres should be
involved in the decision-making process.

8.5 Pacing in hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy
8.5.1 Bradyarrhythmia
AVB in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) should generally be
treated according to the recommendations in this guideline (see section 5.2). Certain genetically inherited subtypes of HCM are more
prone to develop AVB, as is the case with transthyretin amyloidosis,
Anderson�Fabry and Danon diseases, PRKAG2 syndrome, and mitochondrial cytopathies. [575][,][576] An ICD/CRT-D rather than a pacemaker
should be considered in patients with symptomatic bradycardia who
have LVEF <_35% or otherwise fulfil the criteria for primary prevention of SCD by current guidelines. [576] (For extended literature on con[duction disorders in HCM see the Supplementary data, section 8.5.)](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)

8.5.2 Pacing for the management of left ventricular

outflow tract obstruction

In patients with symptoms caused by LV outflow tract obstruction,
treatment options include drugs, surgery, septal alcohol ablation, and
AV sequential pacing with a short AV delay. Three small, randomized,
placebo-controlled studies and several long-term observational studies reported reductions in LV outflow tract gradients, and variable
improvement in symptoms and quality of life with AV sequential
pacing. [577][�][582] Myectomy achieved superior haemodynamic results
compared with DDD pacing, [583] but is a more invasive and higher risk
intervention. In one trial, a subgroup analysis suggested that older
patients (>65 years) are more likely to benefit from DDD AV
sequential pacing. [579] A recent meta-analysis—comprising 34 studies
and 1135 patients—found that pacing reduced the LV outflow gradient by 35%, with a non-significant trend towards reduction in
NYHA class. [584]

Shared decision-making should be employed when considering the
treatment of choice for patients with obstructive HCM.

50 ESC Guidelines


As current ICDs provide all pacemaker functions, a standalone
pacemaker is rarely indicated in LQTS today. However, in individual patients with LQTS and catecholamine-induced torsades-depointes, shock therapy may be disadvantageous or even fatal; in
these cases, pacing and beta-blocker therapy alone without an
ICD may be used. Pacemaker instead of ICD implantation represents a treatment option in neonates and small infants with
LQTS, [594] and an alternative in LQTS patients with symptomatic
bradycardia (spontaneous or due to beta-blockers) if ventricular
tachyarrhythmias are unlikely or if ICD implantation is not desired
(e.g. patient preference).
An indication for a pacemaker in LQTS exists in neonates and
infants with a 2:1 AVB due to excessive corrected QT prolongation
with long myocardial refractory periods. [595]

Temporary pacing at an increased rate (usually 90- 120 b.p.m.) is an
important treatment in LQTS patients with electrical storm, because
an increase in the basic heart rate shortens the window of vulnerability
for reinduction of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia.

8.6.2 Neuromuscular diseases

Neuromuscular diseases are a group of heterogeneous inherited disorders affecting the skeletal muscle and frequently also involve the
heart (for extended literature on conduction disorders in neuromuscular disease, see the supplementary literature on pacing in rare dis[ease and Supplementary Table 17). The cardiac phenotype variably](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
includes all types of cardiomyopathies, conduction defects with or
without cardiomyopathies, and supraventricular and ventricular
tachyarrhythmias. [596][�][598] Duchenne, Becker, and limb-girdle types
2C, 2F, and 2I are muscular dystrophies in which the development of
dilated cardiomyopathy is common and usually the predominant feature. Arrhythmias and conduction disease can be associated with the
development of cardiomyopathy. [596][�][598] Such patients are considered for pacemakers or ICDs on the basis of guidelines used for
other non-ischaemic cardiomyopathies. [242] Myotonic dystrophy types

�
1 and 2, Emery Dreifuss, and limb-girdle type 1B often present with
conduction disease and associated arrhythmias, and variably with cardiomyopathy. [596][,][597] The recommendations present guidance in the
instances where the recommendations for cardiac pacing differ from
those used for other patients with bradycardia.

Pacing parameters should be optimized to achieve maximum pre-excitation of

8.5.3 Pacemaker implantation following septal
myectomy and alcohol septal ablation
In a study involving 2482 patients with obstructive HCM, 2.3% developed AVB after septal myectomy [588] (only 0.6% in those with normal
baseline conduction vs. 34.8% in patients with pre-existing RBBB).
Alcohol septal ablation causes AVB in 7�20% of patients; [576] those
with pre-existing conduction defects, mainly LBBB, are at highest
risk. [585]

8.5.4 Cardiac resynchronization therapy in end-stage
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Based on the findings of a small cohort study, [589] CRT was given both
a class IIa and a class IIb recommendation in previous guidelines for
patients with HCM, HF, LBBB, and LVEF <50%. [576][,][590] More recent
studies did not demonstrate sustained efficacy of this therapy. [591][�][593]

Until further evidence becomes available, standard criteria for CRT

are recommended in patients with HCM (section 6).

8.6 Pacing in rare diseases
8.6.1 Long QT syndrome
There are multiple inter-relationships between the different forms of
long QT syndrome (LQTS) and bradycardia: LQTS can be associated
with sinus bradycardia; very long ventricular myocardial refractory
periods can cause 2:1 AVB; sudden rate changes can trigger torsadesde-pointes tachycardia; and treatment with beta-blockers to suppress
sympathetic triggers of torsades-de-pointes may cause bradycardia.

Mutations in the LMNA gene, which encodes lamin A and C intermediate filaments of the nuclear envelope, cause a variety of inherited . [........]
diseases defined as ‘laminopathies’. [605][�][607] According to the type of
mutation, they can lead to isolated cardiac disorders or additional
systemic or musculoskeletal disorders such as the Emery�Dreifuss
autosomal dominant variant or limb-girdle dystrophy. Around
5�10% of dilated cardiomyopathies are induced by LMNA gene
mutations, manifested as cardiac conduction disease, tachyarrhythmias, or impaired myocardial contractility. [596][,][606][�][620] SND and conduction disease are frequently the first manifestation, in many cases
with preserved LV size and function. [613][,][614] LMNA-related cardiomyopathy is more malignant than most other cardiomyopathies, carrying a higher risk of SCD in asymptomatic mutation carriers with
preserved or only mildly decreased LV contractility. [610][�][615]


presentations. [621][,][622] In Kearns�Sayre syndrome, the most common
cardiac manifestation is conduction disease, which may progress to
complete AVB and cause SCD. [623][�][625]

8.6.5 Infiltrative and metabolic diseases

Infiltrative cardiomyopathy is secondary to abnormal deposition and
accumulation of pathological products in the myocardial interstitium,
while storage diseases lead to their intracellular accumulation. The
main cause of infiltrative cardiomyopathy is amyloidosis, while storage diseases include haemochromatosis, Fabry’s disease, and glycogen
storage diseases. In patients with cardiac amyloid, conduction defects,
tachyarrhythmias, and SCD are common. Based upon current knowledge, conventional indications should be used for pacing in this group
of patients.

8.6.6 Inflammatory diseases
Infections (viral, bacterial including Borreliosis, protozoa, fungal, parasites), autoimmune (e.g. giant cell myocarditis, sarcoidosis, rheumatic
heart disease, connective tissue disease, eosinophilic myocarditis),
toxic (alcohol, cocaine, cancer therapies, especially monoclonal antibodies), and physical reactions (radiation therapy) can cause inflammatory heart disease. Involvement of the AVN and the conduction
system is more frequent than that of the sinus node. AVB may indicate involvement of the septum in the inflammatory process and is a
predictor of adverse outcome. Ventricular arrhythmias may also
occur because of myocardial pathology.
When inflammatory heart disease is complicated by bradycardia,
especially AVB, specific therapy should be applied if available, eventually backed-up by temporary pacing or intravenous administration of
isoprenaline. Otherwise, immunosuppressive therapy or awaiting
spontaneous resolution may be sufficient. If bradycardia does not
resolve within a clinically reasonable period or cannot be expected
to resolve (e.g. after radiation therapy), permanent pacing is indicated. Before choosing a device type, the indication for an ICD and/
or CRT rather than a single-chamber or DDD pacemaker should be




Pacemaker implantation does not reduce the risk of SCD in these
patients. A meta-analysis of mode of death in LMNA mutations demonstrated that 46% of patients who died suddenly had an implanted
pacemaker. Sudden death rates were similar in those with isolated
cardiomyopathy and those with an additional neuromuscular phenotype. [611] Complex ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients
with conduction disturbances. [612][,][613][,][615] In two studies, patients with
LMNA mutations and an indication for permanent pacing underwent
ICD implantation, and appropriate ICD therapies occurred in 42%
and 52% of patients within 3 and 5 years, respectively. [612][,][613] These
findings led to the clinical practice to consider ICD rather than pacemaker implantation in LMNA-related conduction disease. [614][,][620] For
additional clinical risk factors for ventricular tachyarrhythmias and
sudden death found in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy due to
[LMNA gene mutations, see Supplementary Table 18. CRT(D) should](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)

considered because most causes of inflammatory disease causing bradycardia may also result in reduced myocardial contractility and ven
tricular fibrosis.

8.6.6.1 Sarcoidosis

Persistent or intermittent AVB can occur in sarcoidosis, which shows

a propensity to involve the basal intraventricular septum. In a Finnish
registry, 143 of 325 patients (44%) diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis
had Mobitz II second- or third-degree AVB in the absence of other
explanatory cardiac disease. [626] A history of syncope, pre-syncope, or
palpitations points towards bradycardia, but also to potential ventricular tachyarrhythmia. AVB is the most common clinical presentation
in patients with clinically evident cardiac sarcoidosis. [627][,][628] Diagnostic
steps include ECG monitoring, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and
myocardial or other involved tissue biopsy. Fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography may be useful. [629] The chances and
time course of resolution of AVB with immunosuppressive therapy
are not clear, [630] but may be low. [88] Long-term data are available
mainly from a Canadian prospective study (32 patients), [627] a Japanese
retrospective study (22 patients), [628] and a Finnish registry (325
patients). [626] Reversibility of conduction disorder is unpredictable
and, even in patients with transient AVB, permanent pacing should be
considered. [631] Immunosuppressive treatment may increase risk of
device infection. However, there are no firm data to support device
implantation before initiation of immunosuppressive medication.
Patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and AVB are at high risk of SCD during long-term follow-up, even if LVEF is >35%. [626] Patients with even a

�
mild or moderate decrease in LVEF (35 49%) are at increased risk
of SCD. [632][,][633] Therefore, in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who
have an indication for cardiac pacing and LVEF <50%, a CRT-D
should be considered rather than a pacemaker [634] (section 6).

8.7 Cardiac pacing in pregnancy
Vaginal delivery carries no extra risks in a mother with congenital
complete heart block, unless contraindicated for obstetric reasons. [635] For women who have a stable, narrow complex junctional
escape rhythm, pacemaker implantation may not be necessary or can
be deferred until after delivery if none of the risk factors (syncope, . [..........................................................................................................................................................................]


pauses >3� the cycle length of the ventricular escape rhythm, wide
QRS escape rhythm, prolonged QT interval, complex ventricular
ectopy, mean daytime heart rate <50 b.p.m.) is present. However,
women with complete heart block who exhibit a slow, wide QRS
complex escape rhythm should undergo pacemaker implantation
during pregnancy. The risks of pacemaker implantation are generally
low and can be performed safely, especially if the foetus is beyond 8
weeks gestation. A pacemaker for the alleviation of symptomatic bradycardia can be implanted at any stage of pregnancy using echo guidance or electroanatomic navigation minimizing fluoroscopy. [636][,][637]
### 9 Special considerations on device implantations and peri-operative management

9.1 General considerations

Patients with clinical signs of active infection and/or fever should not
undergo a permanent pacemaker (including leadless pacemaker)
implantation until they have been afebrile for at least 24 h. Febrile
patients who have been started on antibiotics should ideally receive a
complete course of antibiotic treatment and should be afebrile for
24 h after termination of antibiotic treatment before definite pacemaker implantation is performed if acute pacing is not required. If
possible, the use of temporary transvenous pacing should be avoided.
In patients in need of acute pacing, temporary transvenous pacing
should be established, preferably with jugular or axillar/lateral subclavian vein access. [638] In a multicentre, prospective study with 6319
patients, fever within 24 h of implantation (OR 5.83, 95% CI
2.00�16.98) and temporary pacing before implantation (OR 2.46,
95% CI 1.09�5.13) were positively correlated with the occurrence
of device infection. [639] In the case of patients with chronic recurrent
infection, minimally invasive implantation of an epicardial pacemaker
may be considered.

9.2 Antibiotic prophylaxis
The use of pre-operative systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended as the standard of care in pacemaker implantation
procedures. The risk of infection is significantly reduced with a single

�
dose of prophylactic antibiotic (cefazolin 1 2 g i.v. or flucloxacillin
1�2 g i.v.) given within 30�60 min [90�120 min for vancomycin
(15 mg/kg)] before the procedure. [640][�][643] The antibiotic prophylaxis
should cover S. aureus species, but routine coverage of methicillinresistant S. aureus is not recommended. The use of vancomycin
should be guided by patient risk for methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization and the prevalence of the bacterium in the corresponding
institution. [638]

In contrast, post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce
the incidence of infection. [644][,][645]

9.3 Operative environment and skin
antisepsis
The pacemaker implantation procedure should be performed in an
operating environment that meets the standards of sterility as
required for other surgical implant procedures. [638][,][646]


8.6.6.1 Sarcoidosis

Persistent or intermittent AVB can occur in sarcoidosis, which shows

a propensity to involve the basal intraventricular septum. In a Finnish
registry, 143 of 325 patients (44%) diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis
had Mobitz II second- or third-degree AVB in the absence of other
explanatory cardiac disease. [626] A history of syncope, pre-syncope, or
palpitations points towards bradycardia, but also to potential ventricular tachyarrhythmia. AVB is the most common clinical presentation
in patients with clinically evident cardiac sarcoidosis. [627][,][628] Diagnostic
steps include ECG monitoring, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and
myocardial or other involved tissue biopsy. Fluorodeoxyglucosepositron emission tomography may be useful. [629] The chances and
time course of resolution of AVB with immunosuppressive therapy
are not clear, [630] but may be low. [88] Long-term data are available
mainly from a Canadian prospective study (32 patients), [627] a Japanese
retrospective study (22 patients), [628] and a Finnish registry (325
patients). [626] Reversibility of conduction disorder is unpredictable
and, even in patients with transient AVB, permanent pacing should be
considered. [631] Immunosuppressive treatment may increase risk of
device infection. However, there are no firm data to support device
implantation before initiation of immunosuppressive medication.
Patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and AVB are at high risk of SCD during long-term follow-up, even if LVEF is >35%. [626] Patients with even a

�
mild or moderate decrease in LVEF (35 49%) are at increased risk
of SCD. [632][,][633] Therefore, in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis who
have an indication for cardiac pacing and LVEF <50%, a CRT-D
should be considered rather than a pacemaker [634] (section 6).

Based on data from surgical and intravascular catheter procedures,
skin antisepsis should be performed using chlorhexidine�alcohol
instead of povidone-iodine�alcohol. [647][,][648] In a large RCT comprising
2546 patients, chlorhexidine�alcohol was associated with a lower
incidence of short-term intravascular catheter-related infections (HR
0.15, 95% CI 0.05 - 0.41; P = 0.0002). [647]

9.4 Management of anticoagulation
It is well known that the development of a pocket haematoma after
the implantation of a pacemaker system significantly increases the
risk for subsequent pocket infection. [641][,][643][,][649] The Bridge or
Continue Coumadin for Device Surgery Randomized Controlled
Trial (BRUISE CONTROL) proved that a clinically significant pocket
haematoma is an independent risk factor for subsequent device infection (HR 7.7, 95% CI 2.9�20.5; P < 0.0001). [649] Therefore, it is of
utmost importance to take all steps to avoid post-operative pocket

haematoma.

Heparin bridging for pacemaker implantation in patients anticoagulated with a vitamin K antagonist leads to a significant 4.6-fold increase
in post-operative pocket haematoma compared with a continued
warfarin strategy. [650] International normalized ratio tapering and temporary shifting of dual antiplatelet to single antiplatelet administration
may significantly reduce the haematoma and infection rate by 75%
and 74%, respectively, compared with heparin bridging. [651]

Regarding non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, the
Randomized Controlled Trial of Continued Versus Interrupted
Direct Oral Anti-Coagulant at the Time of Device Surgery (BRUISE
CONTROL-2) was stopped prematurely due to futility because the
event rate was far lower than anticipated; however, it suggested that, . [..........................................................................................]


depending on the clinical scenario and concomitant antiplatelet therapy, either stopping or continuing non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants might be reasonable at the time of device implantation. [652]

Patients on dual antiplatelet therapy have a significantly increased
risk of post-operative pocket haematoma compared with patients
treated with aspirin alone or without antiplatelet therapy. In such
cases, P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors should be discontinued for 3�7
days (according to the specific drug) before the procedure where
possible and based on an individualized risk assessment. [638][,][653][,][654] For
more details on the management of anticoagulation in the pacemaker
procedure, refer to Table 11.

9.5 Venous access

Transvenous lead implantation for pacemaker implantation is commonly performed by venous access via the cephalic, subclavian, or
axillary vein. In the case of clinical signs of venous occlusion of the
subclavian vein or the innominate vein, pre-operative imaging (venography or chest CT scan) may be useful in planning venous access or
an alternative access ahead of the procedure. In the case of impossible superior venous access, appropriate, alternative approaches may
be transfemoral lead implantation, or implantation of a leadless
device or epicardial leads.
When using the Seldinger technique, there is a risk of a pneumothorax, haemothorax, inadvertent arterial puncture, and injury to the
brachial plexus during venous puncture of the subclavian vein and
(less so) the axillary vein. These risks are avoidable by using the cephalic vein approach, which allows venous insertion of leads under

direct vision. Subclavian vein access is associated with a 7.8-fold

increased risk of pneumothorax. [658] Prospective data on axillary vein
puncture suggest a lower risk of access-related complications compared with subclavian puncture. [659] Ultrasound guidance for axillary
vein puncture has been described as a helpful technique for achieving
a safe and uncomplicated puncture. [660]

With regards to lead failure after implantation, there is evidence
that the axillary vein route is associated with a lower rate of lead failures in long-term follow-up. In a retrospective study comprising 409
patients and mean follow-up of 73.6 ± 33.1 months, lead failure
occurred in 1.2% of patients with contrast-guided axillary vein puncture, 2.3% of patients with cephalic vein cutdown, and 5.6% of
patients with subclavian vein puncture. In multivariable regression
analysis, the only predictor of lead failure was subclavian vein puncture instead of axillary vein access (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.071�0.954; P
= 0.042). When analysing the success rates of the different venous
access approaches, the cephalic vein approach showed the lowest
success rate (78.2% vs. axillary vein 97.6% and subclavian vein 96.8%;
P < 0.001). [661]

9.6 Lead considerations

In choosing between active or passive fixation pacemaker leads in the
RA or RV, one should consider the potential for perforation and pericarditis, as well as extractability. Active fixation leads have a higher
tendency to create pericardial effusions as well as overt perforations.
Passive fixation leads, due to the non-isodiametric design of the lead
tip, may be a factor in lower procedural success rates and higher risk
for complications with lead extraction, although this point is far from
being clear and is still under evaluation. [662] An RCT is required to clarify this issue.
Regarding perforations, an uncontrolled, non-randomized study
comprising 3815 patients with implant of an RV lead showed no significant difference with regards to myocardial perforations between
active and passive fixation leads (0.5% vs. 0.3%; P = 0.3). [663] Active fixation leads also allow selective site pacing in regions of the RV that
are smooth walled (e.g. the mid-septum). The RA is, however, thin
walled, and perforation of the RA free wall by active fixation leads has
been demonstrated. Some implanting physicians prefer to implant
passive leads in patients at elevated risk of perforation (e.g. elderly
patients). However, based on expert opinion and on the results of a
single-centre, retrospective study on ICD leads (637 patients), in
young patients, the use of active fixation leads in the RA and RV is
recommended in terms of future extractability. [664]

Lead stability and phrenic nerve stimulation are important aspects
of coronary sinus lead implantation. With regards to both, quadripolar leads seem to have relevant advantages. The rate of phrenic nerve
stimulation requiring lead revision is significantly lower compared
with that in bipolar coronary sinus leads. [665][,][666] Furthermore, lead
stability is increased because quadripolar leads can usually be
implanted in the wedged position. If implanted in an apical position
due to wedging, the use of the proximal poles avoids apical stimulation. Therefore, quadripolar leads are recommended for coronary
sinus lead implantation. Active fixation LV leads via a side helix have
been developed, and results have proved reliable stability, easy access
to the target pacing site, and stable LV pacing threshold in the long
term. In comparison with passive fixation quadripolar leads, active fixation bipolar and quadripolar leads achieved similar results. The lead

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


developed to allow for full extractability in the long term. However,
the ease of extractability at long term has not yet been
proven. [667][�][669]

9.7 Lead position
Ventricular pacing has traditionally been performed from the RV
apex. Since the introduction of active fixation leads, alternative pacing
sites such as the RVOT septum or the mid-septum have been evaluated in order to provide more physiological pacing. However,
despite two decades of research, the clinical benefit of RV non-apical
pacing remains uncertain. [670] This may be partly explained by variability in the position of the lead, which is often unintentionally placed on
the anterior free wall, where it may be associated with adverse outcome. [671][�][673] The main advantage of septal pacing probably lies in
the avoidance of perforation of the free wall. In a study of 2200
patients implanted with a pacemaker or ICD lead, an apical position
was independently associated with cardiac perforation (OR 3.37; P =
0.024). [420] A septal position may therefore be preferable in patients at
increased risk of perforation, such as elderly patients especially with a
body mass index <20 kg/m [2], as well as women. [670][,][674]

Placing the lead on the mid-septum may be challenging (even more
so in the RVOT septum, which is a smaller target area). The use of
multiple fluoroscopic views and specially shaped stylets is useful for
this purpose and is outlined in a recent EHRA consensus paper. [34] In
this context, it is important to mention that the accuracy and reproducibility of fluoroscopic assessment of RV lead positions is often
inaccurate. [421]

Multiple fluoroscopic views are also recommended for placing
RVA leads, to ensure there is no inadvertent placement of the lead in
a coronary sinus tributary or in the LV via an intracardiac shunt or

arterial access.

The coronary sinus may be used for LV pacing without the need to
cross the tricuspid valve. It may also be used in the case of other difficulties in deploying an RV lead (e.g. in the case of a tricuspid valve
prosthesis). In selected patients, the outcome is similar to RV
pacing. [675][,][676]

The RA appendage is usually the preferred site for atrial pacing.
The lateral atrium may carry a risk of phrenic nerve capture. [677][,][678]

Alternative pacing sites to avoid AF such as Bachman’s bundle and
the region of the coronary sinus ostium have not shown benefit and
are not to be recommended in routine practice. [679][,][680]

9.8 Device pocket
In recent years, there has been increasing awareness of the device
pocket as a source of complications. Avoidance of pocket infections
has become a special focus in device therapy. The role of pocket haematomas in the development of infections has been discussed earlier.
It is evident that besides adequate management of anticoagulation, a
proper surgical technique with meticulous haemostasis is of utmost

importance.
Most pacemakers are implanted with the creation of a subcutaneous pocket. [681] In patients with a low body mass index and therefore
little subcutaneous tissue, in the case of Twiddler’s syndrome, or for
aesthetic reasons, creation of a submuscular pocket may be preferable. However, this may require deeper sedation for implantation and
generator replacements due to pain. To date, there are no data from
RCTs comparing the two approaches for creating device pockets.


With regards to lead failure after implantation, there is evidence
that the axillary vein route is associated with a lower rate of lead failures in long-term follow-up. In a retrospective study comprising 409
patients and mean follow-up of 73.6 ± 33.1 months, lead failure
occurred in 1.2% of patients with contrast-guided axillary vein puncture, 2.3% of patients with cephalic vein cutdown, and 5.6% of
patients with subclavian vein puncture. In multivariable regression
analysis, the only predictor of lead failure was subclavian vein puncture instead of axillary vein access (HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.071�0.954; P
= 0.042). When analysing the success rates of the different venous
access approaches, the cephalic vein approach showed the lowest
success rate (78.2% vs. axillary vein 97.6% and subclavian vein 96.8%;
P < 0.001). [661]


9.6 Lead considerations

In choosing between active or passive fixation pacemaker leads in the
RA or RV, one should consider the potential for perforation and pericarditis, as well as extractability. Active fixation leads have a higher
tendency to create pericardial effusions as well as overt perforations.
Passive fixation leads, due to the non-isodiametric design of the lead
tip, may be a factor in lower procedural success rates and higher risk
for complications with lead extraction, although this point is far from
being clear and is still under evaluation. [662] An RCT is required to clarify this issue.
Regarding perforations, an uncontrolled, non-randomized study

active and passive fixation leads (0.5% vs. 0.3%; P = 0.3). [663] Active fixation leads also allow selective site pacing in regions of the RV that
are smooth walled (e.g. the mid-septum). The RA is, however, thin

been demonstrated. Some implanting physicians prefer to implant
passive leads in patients at elevated risk of perforation (e.g. elderly
patients). However, based on expert opinion and on the results of a
single-centre, retrospective study on ICD leads (637 patients), in
young patients, the use of active fixation leads in the RA and RV is
recommended in terms of future extractability. [664]

Lead stability and phrenic nerve stimulation are important aspects
of coronary sinus lead implantation. With regards to both, quadripolar leads seem to have relevant advantages. The rate of phrenic nerve
stimulation requiring lead revision is significantly lower compared
with that in bipolar coronary sinus leads. [665][,][666] Furthermore, lead
stability is increased because quadripolar leads can usually be
implanted in the wedged position. If implanted in an apical position
due to wedging, the use of the proximal poles avoids apical stimulation. Therefore, quadripolar leads are recommended for coronary
sinus lead implantation. Active fixation LV leads via a side helix have
been developed, and results have proved reliable stability, easy access
to the target pacing site, and stable LV pacing threshold in the long
term. In comparison with passive fixation quadripolar leads, active fixation bipolar and quadripolar leads achieved similar results. The lead
design with an active fixation mechanism via a side helix was

Historical data from 1000 patients with ICD implants showed significantly shorter procedural times for patients with subcutaneous
device pockets. No significant differences with regard to pocket haematomas were found. There were no significant differences in the
cumulative percentages of patients free from complication during follow-up. [682]

Pocket irrigation at the end of the procedure with normal saline
leads to dilution of possible contaminants and eliminates debris from
the wound before closure. [683][,][684] Addition of antibiotics to the rinsing
solution does not reduce the risk of device infections. [683]

The World-wide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope Infection
Prevention Trial (WRAP-IT study) investigated the effect of an
absorbable antibiotic-eluting envelope on the development of postoperative CIED infections. A total of 6983 patients undergoing a
CIED pocket revision, generator replacement, or system upgrade, or
initial implantation of a CRT-D were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio,
to receive the antibiotic envelope or not. The rate of CIED infection
in patients who had the antibacterial envelope was 0.7% vs. 1.2% in
the control group (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.36�0.98; P = 0.04). [685] No effect
on infection rate was observed in the subgroup with pacemakers. [685]

Considering cost-effectiveness aspects, the use of an antibiotic envelope may be considered in pacemaker patients at high risk for CIED
infections. Risk factors to be considered in this context are end-stage
renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and device replacement, revision, or upgrade procedures. [638]

### 10 Complications of cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy

10.1 General complications
Cardiac pacing and CRT are associated with a substantial risk of complications (Table 12), most of which occur in the perioperative
phase, [429][,][690] but a sizable risk remains during long-term follow-up. [691]

Complication rates after dual-chamber pacemaker implantation in
the MOST trial were 4.8% at 30 days, 5.5% at 90 days, and 7.5% at 3
years. [692] However, ‘real-life’ data indicate a higher risk. [690][,][693] In a
recent study of >81 000 patients receiving de novo CIED implantations, major complications occurred in 8.2% within 90 days of hospital discharge. [694] Mortality in hospital (0.5%) and within 30 days (0.8%)

was low.

Complication risks generally increase with the complexity of the
device and are more common in the context of a device upgrade or
lead revisions compared with de novo implantation. In a Danish
population-based cohort study, complications were observed in
9.9% of patients at first device implantation and in 14.8% upon
upgrade or lead revision. [354] Procedures limited to replacement of
the generator had a lower complication risk (5.9%). In the prospective REPLACE registry, a similar proportion (4%) of complication
risks in the setting of generator replacement was reported, but much
higher risks were found in those with one or more additional lead
insertions (up to 15.3%). [695] Accordingly, major complications were
particularly more common with CRT upgrade procedures, a finding
that was corroborated in a large US inpatient cohort [339] and a prospective Italian observational study. [696] The rate of procedural complications also increases with comorbidity burden. [697]

Thus, careful shared decision-making is warranted when considering upgrades to more complex systems. This also applies to prophylactic replacement of recalled CIED generators and leads, a scenario
in which procedural risks should be carefully weighed against the risks
associated with device or lead failure. [698]

Overall, complication rates are closely linked to individual and
centre implantation volumes. [429][,][658][,][693] Complications were increased
by 60% in inexperienced operators who had performed fewer than

25 implantations. [429] Data from a large national quality assurance programme for pacemakers and CRT-P showed that the annual hospital
implantation volume was inversely related to complication rates,
with the greatest difference observed between the lowest (1- 50

�
implantations/year) and the second lowest quintile (51 90 implantations/year). [699] Furthermore, emergency and out-of-hours procedures are associated with increased complication rates. [354] These
data clearly suggest that CIED procedures should be performed by
operators and centres with a sufficient procedural volume.

10.2 Specific complications
10.2.1 Lead complications
Pacemaker leads are a frequent source of complications due to dislodgement, insulation defects, lead fractures, and sensing or threshold
problems. In a Danish cohort, lead-related interventions (2.4%) were
the most common major complication. [354] LV leads have a particular
propensity for complications such as dislodgement and coronary vein
dissection or perforation. [700] In a nationwide registry, LV leads (4.3%)
were more commonly associated with complications compared with
RA leads (2.3%) and RV leads (2.2%). [429] A CRT device (OR 3.3) and

passive fixation RA lead (OR 2.2) were the most important risk
predictors.
A meta-analysis of 25 CRT trials noted mechanical complications
in 3.2% (including coronary sinus dissection or perforation, pericardial effusion or tamponade, pneumothorax, and haemothorax), other
lead problems in 6.2%, and infections in 1.4%. Peri-implantation
deaths occurred in 0.3%. [369]

10.2.2 Haematoma

�
Pocket haematoma is a frequent complication (2.1 9.5%), which can
usually be managed conservatively. Evacuation, required in 0.3�2%
of cases, is associated with an �15 times increased risk of infection. [639]

Moreover, patients developing pocket haematoma stay in hospital
longer and have a higher in-hospital mortality rate (2.0% vs. 0.7%). [724]

Hence, appropriate precautions are critical, and reoperation should
be limited to patients with severe pain, persistent bleeding, distension
of the suture line, and imminent skin necrosis. Many haematomas can
be avoided by careful haemostasis and optimal management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs.

10.2.3 Infection

Infection is one of the most worrying CIED complications, causing
significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. [725][,][726] Infection
rates are higher with device replacement or upgrade procedures, [695]

as well as CRT or ICD implants compared with simple pacemaker
implantation. [727] Olsen et al. [702] reported the lifetime risk of system
infection in patients with: a pacemaker (1.19%), ICD (1.91%), CRT-P
(2.18%), and CRT-D (3.35%). Specifically, patients undergoing reoperations, those with a previous device-related infection, men, and
younger patients had a significantly higher risk of infection.
Similar findings have been reported in a large cohort of patients
receiving an ICD, with infection rates of 1.4% for single, 1.5% for dual,
and 2.0% for biventricular ICDs. [728] In addition, early reintervention
(OR 2.70), previous valvular surgery (OR 1.53), reimplantation (OR
1.35), renal failure on dialysis (OR 1.34), chronic lung disease (OR
1.22), cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.17), and warfarin use (OR 1.16)
were associated with an increased risk of infection. [702] Infections also

occur more frequently with use of temporary pacing or other procedures before implantation (OR 2.5 and 5.8, respectively), early reinterventions (OR 15), and lack of antibiotic prophylaxis (OR
2.5). [639][,][729]

Further comprehensive information on how to prevent, diagnose,
and treat CIED infections has been provided in a recent EHRA consensus document. [642]

10.2.4 Tricuspid valve interference
CIED leads may interfere with tricuspid valve function intraoperatively by causing damage to the tricuspid valve leaflets or the
subvalvular apparatus, or chronically after operation or lead extraction. This damage has been linked to haemodynamic deterioration
and an adverse clinical outcome. [730] In fact, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation is generally associated with excess mortality [731][,][732]

and occurs at a significantly higher rate in CIED patients. [733] The prevalence of significant tricuspid regurgitation (defined as grade 2 or
above) following CIED implantation varies between 10% and 39%.
Most studies attribute a greater harm with ICD leads and in the

presence of multiple RV leads. [45][,][46][,][49][,][445][,][642][,][685][,][697][,][709][,][728][,][730][�][732] The
issue of lead interference with bioprosthetic tricuspid valves or after
annuloplasty or repair is debated. Furthermore, there is no firm evidence supporting that pacing-induced RV dyssynchrony significantly
contributes to tricuspid regurgitation. A recent study randomizing 63
patients to pacing lead positions in the RV apex, RVS, or LV pacing via
the coronary sinus did not affect the development of tricuspid regurgitation. [734] The diagnostic work-up of CIED lead-related tricuspid
regurgitation based on clinical, haemodynamic, and in particular echocardiographic (2D, 3D, and Doppler) evaluation is often challenging. [735] While clear guidance for the management of tricuspid
regurgitation in the presence of CIED leads is still lacking, a high level
of clinical suspicion is required, not discounting the possibility that
worsening HF may be a consequence of the mechanical effect on tricuspid leaflet mobility or coaptation. [730] General treatment options
include medical therapy aiming to relieve congestion and lead extraction with careful replacement, or use of alternative pacing strategies,
such as LV pacing via the coronary sinus or epicardial leads.
However, transvenous lead extraction itself carries a risk of damage
to the tricuspid valve and, hence, worsening tricuspid regurgitation.
While leadless pacing eliminates the need for transvalvular leads, it
may still negatively affect tricuspid valve function, potentially due to

mechanical interference and abnormal electrical and mechanical ventricular activation. [736] Indications for surgical valve repair or replacement in the context of CIED-induced tricuspid regurgitation follow
current recommendations based on the presence of symptoms,
severity of tricuspid regurgitation, and RV function. When considering tricuspid valve surgery, management of the RV lead should follow
the recommendations outlined in section 8.2.3. [737] Methods for percutaneous tricuspid repair have recently gained major attention, but evi
dence in favour of such interventions in the context of lead-related
tricuspid regurgitation is still limited. [738]

10.2.5 Other

Increased complication risks have been observed in women (mainly
pneumothorax and cardiac perforation) and in those with a low body
mass index. [354][,][739] Patients older than 80 years were also found to
have a lower risk of lead-related reinterventions compared with

�
patients aged 60 79 years (1.0% vs. 3.1%). [354]

Finally, suboptimal atrioventricular synchrony may lead to the
pacemaker syndrome, giving rise to cannon waves caused by simultaneous atrial and ventricular contractions and symptoms of fatigue,
dizziness, and hypotension (see section 5). Long-term RV pacing induces a dyssynchronous ventricular activation pattern that may promote progressive LV dysfunction and clinical HF. Strategies to avoid
and resolve the adverse effect of RV pacing have been discussed
above (section 6).
### 11 Management considerations

an interdisciplinary team in partnership with the patient and family,
should be adopted in order to deliver comprehensive treatment

decision-making. The integrated-care approach has its origins in the
chronic care model developed by Wagner et al., [740] and has the
potential to improve clinical and patient outcomes in arrhythmia
management [741][�][743] (see section 12). Relevant specialists to be
included in the interdisciplinary team are included according to the
patient’s needs and local service availability (Figure 13).

11.1 Magnetic resonance imaging in
patients with implanted cardiac devices
MRI is a frequent requirement in patients with implanted pacemakers.
It may cause adverse effects such as inappropriate device function
due to device reset or sensing problems, interaction with the magnetic reed switch, induction of currents resulting in myocardial capture, heating at the lead tip with changes in sensing or capture
thresholds, or lead perforation. Risk factors for adverse events with
[MRIs are listed in Supplementary Table 19.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
Currently, most manufacturers propose devices that are MRI conditional. It is the entire CIED system (i.e. combination of generator
and leads, which need to be from the same manufacturer) that determines MRI conditionality, and not the individual elements. MRI scans
may be limited to 1.5 T and a whole-body specific absorption rate
(SAR) <2 W/kg (head SAR <3.2 W/kg), but some models allow 3 T
and up to 4 W/kg whole-body SAR. The manufacturer may specify an
exemption period (usually 6 weeks) after implantation, but it may be
reasonable to perform an MRI scan earlier if clinically warranted.
There is ample evidence that MRIs can be performed safely in nonconditional pacemakers, as long as a number of precautions are taken. [744][�][746] In 2017, the Heart Rhythm Society published an expert
consensus statement on MRIs in patients with CIEDs, which was
developed with and endorsed by a number of associations including
the EHRA and several radiological associations. [745] For detailed recommendations on appropriate workflow and programming, see
[Supplementary Tables 20, 21, and 22 and Supplementary Figure 2.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab364#supplementary-data)
When leads are connected to a generator, the latter component
absorbs part of the energy and dissipates heat via the large surface
area. Abandoned transvenous leads are prone to heating of the lead
tip by �10 [�] C as shown by an in vitro study. [747] It is, however, difficult
to extrapolate results from experimental models to the in vivo setting.
No adverse events were reported from four series totalling 125
patients with abandoned transvenous leads. [748][�][751] The largest study
reported 80 patients [749] who underwent 97 scans (including the
thoracic region), limited to an SAR <1.5 W/kg. Half of the cohort had
measurement of troponin levels before and after the scan, without
any significant changes. Therefore, 1.5 T MRI scans (limited to SAR
<1.5 W/kg) may be considered in selected patients, taking into
account the risk�benefit ratio, particularly if the scans are extrathoracic and patients are not pacemaker dependent.
Epicardial leads connected to a generator result in a 10 [�] C increase
in temperature during in vitro testing, and by as much as 77 [�] C with
abandoned epicardial leads. [747] Data from 23 patients with epicardial
leads have been reported, [749][�][752] including 14 patients with abandoned epicardial leads, [749][�][751] without any adverse effect of MRI
scans. Given the paucity of data related to safety in patients with epicardial leads, lead adaptors/extenders, or damaged leads, recommendations cannot be made at this stage regarding MRIs in these patients.

11.2 Radiation therapy in pacemaker
patients
An increasing number of patients with CIEDs are referred for radiotherapy, [757] with a reported annual rate of 4.33 treatments per 100
000 person-years. Radiotherapy uses high-energy ionizing radiation
including X-rays, gamma rays, and charged particles, which might
cause software and hardware errors in CIEDs, especially when pho
�
ton radiation beam energy exceeds 6 10 MV, and the radiation dose

�
to the device is high (>2 10 Gy). [758][,][759] Hard errors are rare, and are

most often due to direct irradiation to the device. This can cause irre
versible hardware damage, requiring device replacement. Soft errors
are more common, and are associated with secondary neutron production by irradiation. [760] Such errors typically include resets of the
device without causing structural damage, and can be solved without
replacement. [757][,][759]

Electromagnetic interference during radiotherapy can cause
oversensing, although this very rarely occurs in clinical practice. [760]

Device relocation before radiotherapy is very rarely recom

with adequate tumour treatment or in very selected high-risk
cases. [757][,][761]

According to published recommendations for CIED
patients, [745][,][759][,][762] the risk of malfunction (or adverse events) is higher
in the following situations for pacemaker patients:

 - [With photon radiation applying energy][ >][6][�][10 MV][: the risk of mal-]

functions (usually soft errors) is due to secondary neutron production, is not associated with the target zone, and cannot be

shielded.

 - [With a cumulative dose reaching the device][ >][2 Gy (moderate risk) or]

>10 Gy (high-risk): the dose reaching the pacemaker can be estimated before and measured during treatment, is correlated with
the target zone, and can be shielded.

 - [If the patient is pacemaker dependent.]

Appropriate decision-making is suggested in Figure 15.
Experience with proton radiation therapy in CIED patients is limited. However, compared with photon irradiation, this radiation
modality produces more secondary neutrons, which may affect the
risk of device errors or failure. [763] Currently, no specific guidance can
be given regarding proton radiation therapy in CIED patients.

11.3 Temporary pacing
Temporary pacing can provide electronic cardiac stimulation in

. [....................................................................................]


prophylactically when the need for pacing is anticipated (e.g. after cardiac surgery). [764][,][765] Modalities for emergency temporary pacing
include transvenous, epicardial, and transcutaneous approaches. The
transvenous approach often requires fluoroscopic guidance, although
echo-guided placement is also feasible. [766] Balloon-tipped floating
catheters are easier to insert, more stable, and safer than semi-rigid
catheters. [767][,][768] Patients who undergo transvenous temporary cardiac pacing have a high risk for procedure-related complications (e.g.
cardiac perforation, bleeding, malfunction, arrhythmias, and accidental electrode displacement) and complications related to immobilization (e.g. infection, delirium, and thrombotic events). [764][,][765][,][769][�][775] In
addition, previous temporary pacing is associated with an increased
risk of permanent pacemaker infection. [639][,][641] A percutaneous trans
venous active fixation lead connected to an external device is safer

and more comfortable for patients requiring prolonged temporary
pacing. [776][�][779] There are no good data that support either a jugular
or axillar/subclavian access; however, intrathoracic subclavian puncture should be avoided to reduce the risk of pneumothorax. A jugular
access should be preferred if implantation of a permanent ipsilateral
device is planned. In selected cases where fast and efficient pacing is
needed, a femoral access may be used. Owing to instability of passive
leads placed through the femoral vein and immobilization of the
patient, the duration of this approach should be as short as possible
until bradycardia has resolved or a more permanent solution has
been established. The epicardial approach is mostly used following
cardiac surgery. Removal of these leads is associated with complications such as bleeding and tamponade. [780][�][782] Transcutaneous temporary pacing is a fast and effective non-invasive method, but is not as

11.3 Temporary pacing
Temporary pacing can provide electronic cardiac stimulation in
patients with acute life-threatening bradycardia or can be placed

stable as the transvenous approach, and is limited by the need for
continuous sedation. [783] This modality should only be used in emergency settings or when no other option is available, and under close
haemodynamic monitoring. [784] Before starting temporary pacing,
chronotropic medication should be considered, taking into account

side effects, contraindications, and interactions with other

medication.

This Task Force concludes that temporary transvenous pacing
should be avoided if possible; when it is required, the lead should
remain in situ for as short a time as possible. The use of temporary
pacing should be limited to the emergency treatment of patients with
severe bradyarrhythmia causing syncope and/or haemodynamic compromise, and to cases in whom those bradyarrhythmias are anticipated. Temporary transvenous pacing is recommended when pacing
indications are reversible, such as in the context of antiarrhythmic
drug use, myocardial ischaemia, myocarditis, electrolyte disturbances,
toxic exposure, after cardiac surgery, or as a bridge to permanent
pacemaker implantation when this procedure is not immediately
available or possible due to concomitant infection. Lastly, if a patient
meets the permanent pacemaker implantation criteria, this procedure should be performed promptly.

11.4 Peri-operative management in
patients with cardiovascular implantable
electronic devices

Advisory documents to help manage patients with CIEDs in the perioperative period have been issued by several professional societies. [786][�][789] Supplementary Table 24 summarizes general
recommendations on the management of these patients.

 - [Electromagnetic interference (EMI) may induce oversensing]

(more likely with unipolar leads), activation of rate-responsive
sensors, device resetting, or other damage. The most common
source of EMI is electrocautery, although it is rare during bipolar
electrocautery >5 cm from the CIED and monopolar electrocautery below the umbilicus. [790] To reduce the risk of EMI,
monopolar electrocautery should be applied in short (<5 s)
pulses, with the skin patches away from the area of the device.
Other sources of EMI include radiofrequency procedures, nerve

stimulators, and other electronic devices.

 - [The peri-operative strategy should be tailored based on the indi-]

vidual needs and values of patients, procedure, and
device. [786][�][789] Most procedures will not require any intervention. [791] In pacemaker-dependent patients, a magnet should be
applied during delivery of diathermy pulses, or, if EMI is likely to
occur or magnet stability cannot be guaranteed, the device
should be reprogrammed to an asynchronous mode (VOO/
DOO). The response to magnet application may differ between
device manufactures. CIEDs with a rate-responsive function
using an active sensor may also require magnet application or
disabling of this function to prevent inappropriate rapid pacing.
Post-operative CIED interrogation is recommended if malfunction is suspected or if the device has been exposed to strong

EMI.

11.5 Cardiovascular implantable
electronic devices and sports activity
Regular exercise is strongly recommended for prevention of cardiovascular disease. [792][�][795] Restrictions to patients with a pacemaker,
where appropriate, are motivated by underlying cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is important to address issues of exercise and
sports participation with all pacemaker patients as part of a shared
decision-making process. Comprehensive recommendations for
physical activity in patients with cardiovascular disease have been
published. [792][,][796]

There is consensus that contact sports (e.g. rugby or martial arts)
should be avoided so as not to risk damage of device components or
haematoma at the implantation site. For participation in sports such
as football, basketball, or baseball, special protective shields are recommended to reduce the risk of trauma to the device. Sport interests and right or left arm dominance should be considered when
selecting the implantation site, and submuscular placement can be
considered to reduce the risk of impact. A lateral vascular access is

preferable to prevent the risk of subclavian crush of the lead associ
ated with arm exercises above shoulder level. It is recommended to

abstain from vigorous exercise and ipsilateral arm exercise for 4�6
weeks post-device implantation.
Of note, recommendations regarding sports activity in patients
with an ICD differ from those in pacemaker patients. [797][,][798]

11.6 When pacing is no longer indicated
Different management options are available in patients with
implanted pacemaker systems in whom pacing is no longer indicated:

Leave pacemaker generator and pacemaker leads in situ.

Explant pacemaker generator and abandon leads.

Explant pacemaker generator and leads.
The feasibility of option 1 depends on the end-of-life behaviour of
the implanted generator, which is manufacturer dependent, and may
be erratic and lead to complications in rare cases. [799] Option 1 is the
preferred approach to selected frail and elderly patients.
Option 2 comes with a low procedural risk but may be associated
with the disadvantages of lead abandonment, including future MRI.
Especially in young patients, the potential necessary future require
ment for lead extraction of abandoned leads due to infection and the

associated elevated procedural risk due to longer duration of implantation procedure need to be taken into account. Several studies have
shown increased complexity, lower procedural success, and higher
complication rates of lead extraction procedures of abandoned
leads. [800][�][803]

Option 3 comes with the highest initial procedural risk, but eliminates all possibilities of future device-related complications. When
performed in specialized high-volume centres with current extraction tools, lead extraction procedures can be carried out with high
complete procedural success rates and low complication rates. [802]

This approach may be appropriate for the combination of a young
patient, low risk for extraction, and an experienced extractor.

As part of a patient-centred approach, the decision in such situations has to be based on an individual risk�benefit analysis in a shared
decision-making process together with the patient and his/her carers.
This includes providing sufficient information to achieve an informed
decision-making. Important factors to take into consideration are
patient age, patient condition, comorbidities, pacemaker system, lead
implant duration, and the patient’s life expectancy.


the device should be treated as a single entity, with programming tailored to meet the patient’s needs. The goals are to (i) ensure patient
safety; (ii) provide physiological pacing; (iii) improve patient quality of
life; (iv) improve patient clinical management; and (v) maximize device
longevity. Requirement for follow-up of the underlying cardiac disease
should not be overlooked. In addition to the technical check and optimization of programming, proper counselling of the patient and his/her
family are necessary to meet these goals. The frequency of follow-up
depends on the type of device (CRT and HBP are associated with
more clinical or technical issues and need closer surveillance) and
whether they are on remote device management (Table 13).

 - [Remote device management includes][ remote follow-up][ with full]

remote device interrogation at scheduled intervals (to replace
in-office visits), remote monitoring with unscheduled transmission
of pre-defined alert events, and patient-initiated follow-up with
unscheduled interrogations as a result of a patient experiencing a
real or perceived clinical event. Most studies have focused on
patients with ICDs and CRT-Ds, and have shown a significant
reduction in delay between event detection/clinical decision, and
fewer inappropriate shocks. [804] Two randomized non-inferiority
trials with single-chamber [805] or DDD [805][,][806] pacemakers (no
CRT-P) showed that in-office visits can be safely spaced to
18�24 month intervals if patients are on remote monitoring
with devices having automatic threshold algorithms. Spacing of
scheduled in-office visits is particularly convenient for elderly
patients with limited mobility, but also for young or midlle-aged
patients with full-time jobs, family commitments, etc., and in specific situations (e.g. to avoid exposure during a pandemic).

 - [It is important to conduct remote device management with an]

appropriate set-up that delivers a structured approach to
remote follow-up and a timely response to alerts. Third-party
providers can be useful to triage alerts and assist with this
task. [807] Importantly, compliance with the General Data
Protection Regulation should be respected, as outlined in a
recent ESC regulatory affairs/EHRA document. [808]

patient to make a balanced decision. [824][�][826] Choosing the appropriate educational material is an important component of promoting
the learning process of patients. [827][�][830] Based on the patient’s needs
and preferences, the education should be performed before implantation, at discharge, and during follow-up using a person-centred
approach (Table 14). All patients should receive a brochure provided
by the manufacturer as well as a device identification card before
discharge.
This Task Force emphasizes the importance of patient-centred
care and shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. The
decision to implant a pacemaker/CRT should be based on the best

available evidence with consideration of the individual risk�benefits

of each option, the patient’s preferences, and goals of care. The consultation should include whether the patient is a good candidate for
pacemaker/CRT treatment, and possible alternative treatment
options should be discussed in a way that can be understood by
everyone involved in the discussion. Using the principles of shared
decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients with
decision-making capacity have the right to refuse pacemaker therapy,
even if they are pacemaker dependent.

### 12 Patient-centred care and shared decision-making in cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy

Providing patient-centred care is a holistic process that emphasizes
partnerships in health between patient and clinician, acknowledging
the patient’s needs, beliefs, expectations, healthcare preferences,
goals, and values. [811][�][813] In patient-centred care, the focus is on
shared decision-making, accepting that patients generally prefer to
take an active role in decisions about their health. [814][,][815] This

approach has been shown to improve health outcomes and healthcare experiences. [814][,][816] Clinicians have a duty to define and explain
the healthcare problem and make recommendations about the best
available evidence across all available options at the time, including no
treatment, while ensuring that the patient’s values and preferences
are considered (Figure 16). [817][�][820]

Decision aids, such as written information and/or the use of inter
active websites or web-based applications, can complement the clinicians’ counselling and thus facilitate shared decision-making. [822] When
decision aids are used, patients feel more knowledgeable, have more
accurate risk perceptions, and take a more active part in the decision. [823] In patients with poor language or literacy skills, as well as in
those with cognitive impairment, communication strategies, including
the help of a qualified interpreter, is recommended, as this helps the

Quality indicators are tools that may be used to evaluate care quality,
including that of processes of care and clinical outcomes. [837] They
may also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to guideline
recommendations through quality assurance endeavours and benchmarking of care providers. [838] As such, the role of quality indicators in
driving quality improvement is increasingly recognized and attracts
interest from healthcare authorities, professional organizations,
payers, and the public. [839]

The ESC recognizes the need for measuring and reporting quality
and outcomes of cardiovascular care. One aspect of this is the development and implementation of quality indicators for cardiovascular
disease. The methodology by which the ESC quality indicators are

developed has been published. [839] To date, a suite of quality indicators
for an initial tranche of cardiovascular conditions has been produced. [839][,][840] To facilitate quality improvement initiatives, the diseasespecific ESC quality indicators are included in corresponding ESC
Clinical Practice Guidelines. [296][,][841] This is further enhanced by way of
their integration in the ESC registries, such as the EurObservational
Research Programme (EORP) and the European Unified Registries
On Heart Care Evaluation and Randomized Trials (EuroHeart)
project. [842]

A number of registries exist for patients undergoing CIED implantation, [843] providing ‘real-world’ data about the quality and outcomes
of CIED care. [702] However, there is a lack of a widely agreed set of
quality indicators that encompasses the multifaceted nature of CIED
care, and that serves as a bridge between clinical registries and
guideline recommendations. Thus, and in parallel with the writing of
these guidelines, a suite of quality indicators for patients undergoing
CIED implantation was developed. The full list of these quality indicators, as well as their specifications and development methodology,
has been published elsewhere, [844] with a selection presented in

are indicated.

 - [Ambulatory ECG monitoring is useful in the evaluation of]

patients with suspected bradycardia or cardiac conduction disorder, to correlate rhythm disturbances with symptoms. Choice of
type of monitoring should be based on frequency and nature of
symptoms and patient preferences.

 - [In] patients with SND including those with bradycardia�tachycardia type of SND, when symptoms can clearly be
attributed to bradyarrhythmia, cardiac pacing is indicated.

 - [In patients with SR and permanent or paroxysmal third- or]

66 ESC Guidelines



- [In patients with permanent AF and permanent or paroxysmal]

AVB, single-lead ventricular pacing is indicated.

- [In patients with syncope and unexplained falls, the diagnosis]

should be ascertained using the available diagnostic methods
before pacemaker treatment is considered.

- [In patients with symptomatic HF and LVEF <_35% despite OMT]

who are in SR and have LBBB QRS morphology, CRT is recommended when QRS duration is >_150 ms, and should be consid
�
ered when QRS duration is 130 149 ms. For patients with nonLBBB QRS morphology, evidence for benefit of CRT is less convincing, especially with normal PR and QRS duration <150 ms.
CRT should not be used in patients with HF and QRS duration
<130 ms, unless there is need for ventricular pacing.

- [Selection of patients for CRT based on imaging is limited to the]

measurement of LVEF, whereas the assessment of other factors,

such as extent of myocardial scar, presence of mitral regurgitation, or RV systolic function, is important to anticipate potential
non-responders who may need additional treatments (e.g. mitral
valve intervention).

- [In patients with permanent AF, symptomatic HF, LVEF <_35%,]

and QRS >_130 ms who remain in NYHA class III or ambulatory
IV despite OMT, CRT should be considered.

- [For patients with AF and CRT, AVJ ablation should be consid-]

ered when at least 90�95% effective biventricular pacing cannot

be achieved.

- [For patients with high-degree AVB and an indication for cardiac]

pacing who have HFrEF (LVEF <40%), CRT rather than RV pacing is recommended.

- [HBP may result in normal or near-normal ventricular activation,]

and is an attractive alternative to RV pacing. To date, no data
from randomized trials support that HBP is non-inferior to RV
pacing with respect to safety and efficacy. Therefore, HBP may
be considered for selected patients with AVB and LVEF >40%,
who are anticipated to have >20% ventricular pacing.

- [In patients offered HBP, implantation of an RV lead used as]

‘backup’ for pacing should be considered individually.

- [HBP may correct ventricular conduction in a subset of patients]

with LBBB and may therefore be used in lieu of biventricular pacing for HBP-based CRT in selected patients.

- [In patients treated with HBP, device programming tailored to]

specific requirements of HBP must be ensured.

- [Implanting a leadless pacemaker should be considered when no]

upper extremity venous access exists, when risk of device
pocket infection is particularly increased, and in patients on
haemodialysis.

- [Patients undergoing TAVI are at increased risk of developing]

AVB. Decisions regarding cardiac pacing after TAVI should be
taken based upon pre-existing and new conduction disturbances.

Ambulatory ECG monitoring for 7 30 days or EPS may be considered in patients post-TAVI with new LBBB or progression of
pre-existing conduction anomaly, but not yet any indication for a

surgery who have or develop AVB under surgery, placement of
epicardial pacing leads during surgery should be considered.

- [To reduce the risk of complications, pre-operative anti-]
biotics must be administered before CIED procedures, . [.........................................................................................................................................................................]


chlorhexidine�alcohol should be preferred for skin antisepsis,
and cephalic or axillary vein access should be attempted as first

choice.

 - [Heparin bridging should be avoided in CIED procedures to mini-]

mize the risk of haematoma and pocket infection.

 - [In patients undergoing a CIED reintervention procedure, using]

an antibiotic-eluting envelope may be considered to reduce the

risk of infection.

 - [In the majority of patients with a pacemaker or CRT, a well-]

indicated MRI can be performed if no epicardial leads, abandoned or damaged leads, or lead adaptors/extenders are
present, and certain precautions are taken.

 - [Radiation therapy can be offered to patients with a pacemaker]

or CRT if an individualized treatment planning and risk stratification is done beforehand and the device is interrogated as recommended around the period of radiation therapy.

 - [Remote device management is valuable for earlier detection of]

clinical problems and technical issues, and may allow longer spacing between in-office follow-ups.

 - [The principles of patient-centred care and shared decision-]

making should be used in the consultation both pre-operatively
and during follow-up for patients considered for or living with a

ESC Guidelines 67



- [The beneficial effects of upgrading to CRT from a standard pace-]

maker or ICD in patients with HF and a high frequency of RV
pacing need to be documented.

- [When implanting the LV electrode, it is unknown whether tar-]

geting the latest local activation mechanically or electrically
causes an improved effect of CRT and a better patient outcome.

- [It is unknown whether employing any type of pre-implant imag-]

ing to decide about LV and RV lead placement in CRT may cause
better a patient outcome.

- [In patients with an indication for permanent pacing and need for]

a high frequency of RV pacing because of AVB, it is not known
which patient and treatment characteristics predict development
of pacing-induced cardiomyopathy or HF.

- [In patients with AVB and an indication for cardiac pacing, the]

long-term efficacy and safety of HBP as an alternative to RV pacing need to be proven in RCTs. In addition, the selection of
patients most likely to benefit from HBP is not yet defined.

- [In patients with HF and an indication for CRT, the long-term effi-]

cacy and safety of implementing HBP as an alternative to or element of CRT with biventricular pacing need to be proven in

RCTs. In addition, the selection of CRT candidates who are

most likely to benefit from HBP is not yet defined.

- [Further studies are needed to determine whether HBP could be]

used to improve response in CRT non-responders.

- [The efficacy and safety of left bundle branch area pacing remain]

to be documented.

- [Superiority of a specific location for the RV lead (i.e. septal, out-]

flow tract, or apical) has not been documented for standard pacing indicated for bradycardia or for CRT.

- [Better prediction of who will develop AVB after TAVI is needed.] . [........................................................................................]



- [In symptomatic patients with end-stage HCM and LBBB, there is]

a need to better define the criteria for CRT implantation and

document the clinical features associated with sustained benefit

from the procedure.

- [Optimal treatment including cardiac pacing for patients with]

congenital AVB should be investigated.

- [In pacemaker candidates with cardiomyopathies with >1 year]

expected survival who do not fulfil standard criteria for ICD
implantation, criteria for ICD instead of pacemaker implantation

should be better defined.

- [The optimal pre-operative handling in CIED implantations and]

potential use of pre-operative skin disinfection and/or prehospitalization decolonization in S. aureus carriers remains to be

determined.

- [The optimal approach for the different operational procedure]

elements in CIED implantations, especially for choice of venous
access, active or passive fixation leads in right-sided chambers,
specific pacing sites, use of haemostatic agents in the pocket,
choice of suture types, and application of pressure dressing at
the end of the procedure remains to be determined.

- [Patients with a need for immediate cardiac pacing occasionally]

present with fever and infection; typically, treatment includes
temporary transvenous pacing and antibiotics, followed by
implantation of a permanent pacemaker after the infection has
resolved. It is unknown whether immediate implantation of a
permanent pacemaker after initiation of antibiotics would be

inferior.

- [The role of patient education, patient-centred care, and shared]

decision-making should be studied in CIED populations.
