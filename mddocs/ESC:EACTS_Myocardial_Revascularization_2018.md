### 1 Preamble

Clinical practice guidelines summarize and evaluate all available evidence at the time of the writing process on a particular issue with the



for an individual patient with a given condition, taking into account
the impact on outcome as well as the risk–benefit ratio of particular
diagnostic or therapeutic means. Clinical practice guidelines are no
substitutes for textbooks, but complement them, and cover the
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Core Curriculum topics. As
such they should help physicians to make decisions in their daily practice. However, final decisions should be individualized by responsible
physicians and the patient.
A great number of clinical practice guidelines have been issued in
recent years both by the ESC as well as by other societies and organizations. Because of the impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for
the development of guidelines have been established in order to
make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for
formulating and issuing ESC and joint society guidelines can be found
[on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines).](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
These Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC and the
European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) on this
given topic and will be regularly updated.
Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC and EACTS
to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients
with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for diagnosis, management (including treatment) and/or prevention of a given condition
according to the ESC Committee for Practice Guidelines (CPG) and
EACTS policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed including assessment of the risk–benefit
ratio. Estimates of expected health outcomes for larger populations

were included, where data exist. The level of evidence and the

strength of recommendation of particular treatment options were
weighed and graded according to predefined scales, as outlined in

Tables 1 and 2.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels completed declarations of interest forms on what might be perceived as real or
potential sources of conflicts of interest. These forms were compiled

into one file and can be found on the ESC and EACTS websites

[http://www.escardio.org/guidelines and http://www.eacts.org). Any](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
changes in declarations of interest that arise during the writing period
must be notified to the ESC and EACTS and updated. The Task
Force received its entire financial support from the ESC and EACTS
without any involvement from the healthcare industry.
The CPG-ESC and EACTS supervised and coordinated the preparation of these new Guidelines produced by the joint Task Force.
These entities are also responsible for the endorsement process of

these Guidelines. The ESC/EACTS Guidelines underwent extensive

review by a wide panel of relevant external experts. After appropriate revisions it was approved by all the experts involved in the Task
Force. The finalized document was approved by the ESC CPG and
EACTS for joint publication in the European Heart Journal and the
European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.
The task of developing clinical practice guidelines covers not only
the integration of the most recent research, but also the creation of
educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations. To implement the guidelines, condensed pocket guidelines, summary slides, booklets with essential messages, and an
electronic version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.) are produced. These versions are abridged and, thus, if needed, one should

### 2 Introduction

These Guidelines represent the third time that the ESC and EACTS
have brought together cardiologists and cardiac surgeons in a joint
Task Force to review the ever-increasing body of evidence, with the
mission of drafting balanced, patient-centred practice Guidelines on
myocardial revascularization. Summaries of the key changes in comparison with the previous Guidelines are provided in Figures 1 and 2.
There is considerable overlap of the current document with other
Guidelines, specifically those on stable coronary artery disease, nonST-elevation myocardial infarction, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, heart failure, valvular heart disease and the Focused Update on
Dual Antiplatelet Therapy. Unless supported by new evidence, we
followed the recommendations of these Guidelines where pertinent
to our Guidelines, and refer the reader to the respective sections in
those documents for detailed discussion. We reserve more in-depth
discussion for topics that are specific to issues pertaining to myocar
dial revascularization that are not covered in other Guidelines. To

keep the current document concise and reader-friendly, we also
moved some of the detailed descriptions of study results to the

always refer to the full text version, which is freely available on the

ESC and EACTS websites. The National Societies of the ESC are

encouraged to endorse, translate, and implement the ESC
Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed because it has
been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Surveys and registries are needed to verify that real-life daily practice is in keeping with what is recommended in the guidelines, thus
completing the loop between clinical research, writing of guidelines,
and implementing them in clinical practice.
The guidelines do not, however, override the individual responsibility of healthcare professionals to make appropriate decisions in the

### 3 Diagnostic tools to guide myocardial revascularization

The use of diagnostic imaging and functional testing modalities to
detect patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is discussed in
detail in the clinical practice Guidelines for patients with SCAD. [1]

Further diagnostic assessment of patients with obstructive CAD is
critical in order to identify patients and select specific lesions that are
likely to benefit from myocardial revascularization, in addition to optimal medical therapy.

3.1 Non-invasive diagnostic tools
3.1.1 Assessment of myocardial ischaemia
Non-invasive diagnostic assessment of patients with CAD being considered for myocardial revascularization comprises the assessment of
ischaemia and the evaluation of viability in patients with regional wall
motion abnormalities or reduced ejection fraction (EF).
Functional testing to assess ischaemia is critical for the assessment
of stable patients with CAD. Documentation of ischaemia using functional testing before elective invasive procedures for CAD is the preferred approach. It may also have a role in the assessment of some
patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Because of
the low sensitivity of exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) testing in the
assessment of patients with symptoms of angina, non-invasive imaging


[1]


contractile reserve. [1][,][5] Assessment of ischaemia provides incremental
benefit over viability in mild to moderate CAD, but with extensive
CAD viability assessment may be sufficient. [6] Patients with advanced
HF and viable myocardium should first undergo revascularization
with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) before being considered for mechanical circulatory support (MCS) or heart transplantation. [7][,][8]

The PARR-2 (PET and Recovery following Revascularization) trial
included patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction being
considered for revascularization or HF/transplantation workups, and
randomized them to management assisted by fluorodeoxyglucose
PET (FDG-PET) or standard care. [6] The primary outcome of cardiac
death, myocardial infarction (MI), or recurrent hospital stay for cardiac cause at 1 year was not improved in the group managed by
FDG-PET [relative risk (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.59–1.14, P = 0.16], though the rate of compliance with the treatment recommended by FDG-PET was variable.
The viability substudy of the STICH (Surgical Treatment for
Ischemic Heart Failure) trial found viable myocardium in 487/601
patients (81%) and none in 114 (19%). [9] There was a significant association between myocardial viability and outcome by univariate analysis, but not on multivariable analysis. The lack of correlation between
myocardial viability and benefit from revascularization indicates that
this strategy should not be the only test when selecting the optimal
therapy.


The use of diagnostic imaging and functional testing modalities to

3.1 Non-invasive diagnostic tools
3.1.1 Assessment of myocardial ischaemia
Non-invasive diagnostic assessment of patients with CAD being considered for myocardial revascularization comprises the assessment of
ischaemia and the evaluation of viability in patients with regional wall
motion abnormalities or reduced ejection fraction (EF).
Functional testing to assess ischaemia is critical for the assessment
of stable patients with CAD. Documentation of ischaemia using functional testing before elective invasive procedures for CAD is the preferred approach. It may also have a role in the assessment of some
patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Because of
the low sensitivity of exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) testing in the
assessment of patients with symptoms of angina, non-invasive imaging
is recommended as the first-line test. [1] Detection of a large area of
myocardial ischaemia by functional imaging is associated with
impaired prognosis of patients and identifies patients who should
undergo revascularization (see section 5).
In patients undergoing coronary computed tomography (CT),
both CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and CT perfusion
represent possible approaches to evaluate lesion-specific ischaemia.
Although the evidence for both is limited at present, there are considerably more data from clinical investigations of CT-FFR. A number

of trials have shown that correlation between CT-derived FFR
and invasive FFR is high. [2][,][3] The non-randomized PLATFORM
(Prospective LongitudinAl Trial of FFRct: Outcome and Resource
Impacts) study showed that in patients referred for invasive angiography due to chest pain (predominantly atypical angina) and intermediate pre-test probability of CAD, assessment with CT and CT-FFR
reduced the number of patients with subsequently normal invasive
coronary angiograms compared with standard care. [4] Currently, clini
cal trial data with CT-FFR are insufficient to make a recommendation

for its use in clinical practice.

3.1.2 Assessment of myocardial viability in patients with
heart failure and coronary artery disease
In patients with regional wall motion abnormalities or ventricular dysfunction, heart failure (HF) can be caused by stunned or hibernating
myocardium and may be reversed by revascularization. Assessment
of myocardial viability may be done in order to select patients that
are more likely to benefit from myocardial revascularization and can
be achieved with several imaging modalities: myocardial contrast

3.2 Invasive diagnostic tools

3.2.1 Pressure-derived fractional flow reserve

3.2.1.1 Use of fractional flow reserve in patients with intermediate-grade
coronary stenosis including left main stenosis
Coronary pressure-derived FFR is the current standard of care for
the functional assessment of lesion severity in patients with
intermediate-grade stenosis (typically around 40 – 90% stenosis)
without evidence of ischaemia in non-invasive testing, or in those

with multivessel disease.

ESC/EACTS Guidelines 97


Multiple studies have shown that PCI can be safely deferred if FFR
is >0.75. [12][–][15] The DEFER trial enrolled 325 patients scheduled for
PCI of an intermediate stenosis. [15] If FFR was >_0.75, patients were
randomly assigned to deferral (defer group; n = 91) or performance
(perform group; n = 90) of PCI. The composite rate of cardiac death
and acute MI (AMI) in the defer and perform groups was 3.3 vs. 7.9%
(P = 0.21).
However, most contemporary studies use an FFR cut-off of 0.80.
A recent large-scale observational study supports the use of FFR
>0.80 rather than 0.75 as a cut-off. [16] Indeed, the two largest studies
in this field, DEFINE-FLAIR (Define Functional Lesion Assessment of
Intermediate Stenosis to Guide Revascularization DES drug-eluting
stent) [17] and iFR-SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for
Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies), [18] used the
0.80 cut-off for lesion selection by FFR, with favourable event rates at
1 year. Thus, 0.80 is the accepted FFR threshold for defining haemodynamically relevant lesions.
Haemodynamic relevance, as defined by FFR <_0.80, correlates
poorly with diameter stenosis by visual assessment. In the FAME
(Fractional Flow Reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel
Evaluation) trial, only 35% of the 50–70% stenoses were haemodynamically relevant and, of the 71–90% stenoses, 20% were not. Only
an estimated diameter stenosis >90% predicted haemodynamic relevance with high accuracy (96% correct classification). A number of

studies have shown that utilization of an FFR-based assessment strat
egy at the time of angiography results in reclassification of the revascularization strategy (PCI, bypass surgery, or medical therapy) in a
high proportion of patients with intermediate-grade lesions (>40% of
patients are reclassified). [19][–][22] In addition, separate and pooled analyses of the patients included in those studies have shown that the end
results of ‘FFR-based reclassification’ in patients investigated at the
time of diagnostic angiography is neutral overall for the number of
patients indicated for revascularization. [23]

A patient-level and study-level meta-analysis of 9173 lesions dem
onstrated that with lesions with FFR <0.75, revascularization reduced

the 1 year risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including a
reduction in the composite risk of death and MI. [24] Thus, the FFR

threshold of 0.75 is used to define more severe ischaemia that is of

prognostic relevance.
The presence of intermediate grade left main stem (LMS) disease is
not infrequent and angiographic evaluation may be challenging.
Assessment using pressure-derived FFR is more challenging in comparison with non-LMS stenosis due to the requirement for disengagement
of the guiding catheter and an inability to administer intracoronary
adenosine. Some observational data exist to support the use of FFR in
order to decide if revascularization should be deferred or performed. [25]

In the largest study, which included 230 patients with intermediategrade LMS stenosis, only 23% showed an FFR <0.80. Treatment was
deferred in patients with an FFR >_0.80 and bypass surgery was done in
patients with an FFR <0.80. [26] Clinical outcomes at 5 years were similar
in both groups. However, it is important to consider the potential influence of any untreated downstream disease in the left anterior
descending (LAD) or left circumflex arteries, which may be associated
with an increased risk of a false negative FFR. [27]



been shown in an observational study. [28] Of the 627 patients with
intermediate stenosis that were evaluated, 429 had bypass without
FFR and 198 had bypass with FFR; in the latter group, the proportion
of patients with three-vessel disease was reclassified from 94 to 86%.
Outcomes were similar in both groups at 3 years [hazard ratio (HR)
for death/MI/target vessel revascularization (TVR) = 1.03, 95% CI
0.67–1.69], though the group with FFR guidance was associated with
a lower number of graft anastomoses and a lower rate of on-pump
surgery compared with angiography-guided CABG surgery.

3.2.1.2 Use of fractional flow reserve to identify lesions requiring revascularization in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing

percutaneous coronary intervention
FFR may also be useful for the selection of lesions requiring revascularization in patients with multivessel CAD. The FAME trial showed that
in patients with multivessel disease randomized to an FFR-guided PCI
strategy (using a cut-off <_0.80 to indicate requirement for PCI), outcomes at 12 months in terms of death, non-fatal MI, and repeat revascularization were superior compared with angiography-guided PCI
and utilized fewer resources. [29] In addition, the 2 year composite risk
of death or MI was significantly lower with the FFR-guided PCI strategy. [30] Long-term follow-up at 5 years showed broadly consistent findings, although differences between groups in relation to the primary
endpoint were no longer significant. [31] This suggests that FFR-guided
PCI should be the preferred management strategy in these patients.

3.2.1.3 Fractional flow reserve-guided management vs. medical therapy
in patients with coronary artery disease
In patients with SCAD and at least one stenosis with FFR <_0.80, the
FAME 2 trial showed that PCI using drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation improved the primary endpoint of death, non-fatal MI, or
urgent revascularization within 2 years compared with medical treatment alone, which was driven by a lower need for urgent revascularization. [32] The advantage of FFR-guided PCI over medical therapy
alone was maintained at 3 years. [33]

3.2.2 Other pressure-derived indices
FFR evaluation requires maximal and stable hyperaemia, which is usually obtained by the administration of intravenous (i.v.) adenosine.
Recently, there has been renewed interest in resting indices derived
from resting gradients alone [distal coronary to aortic pressure (Pd/
Pa) or instantaneous wave-free ratio (iwFR)]. Two recent large-scale
randomized trials showed broadly comparable results between FFRguided and iwFR-guided revascularization strategies in patients with
intermediate-grade stenosis. [17][,][18] Revascularization was indicated in

both trials if FFR was <_0.80 or if iwFR was <_0.89. In the DEFINE
FLAIR trial, the primary endpoint of MACE at 1 year occurred in
6.8% in patients randomized to iwFR-guided revascularization vs.
7.0% in patients randomized to FFR-guided revascularization (P
<0.001 for non-inferiority; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68–1.33, P = 0.78). [17] In
the iFR-SWEDEHEART trial, the primary endpoint of death from any
cause, non-fatal MI, or unplanned revascularization was 6.7% in the
iwFR group and 6.1% in the FFR group (P = 0.007 for non-inferiority;
HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.79–1.58, P = 0.53). [18] In this trial, 17.5% of patients
had ACS at the time of presentation. There was no interaction with
outcomes. Both trials are limited by having a follow-up duration of
only 1 year.

98 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


The SYNTAX II study (Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary
Intervention with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery), a single-arm, prospective study in patients with multivessel disease incorporating a
management strategy including combined iwFR/FFR assessment of
stenosis severity in addition to intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)guided stent implantation and guideline-directed medical therapy,
showed encouraging outcomes compared with a historical cohort
enrolled in the SYNTAX trial. [34]

Randomized trials comparing iwFR-guided revascularization with
angiography-guided revascularization or medical therapy are not
available. iwFR has not been extensively validated for patients with

There is no adequate randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to
support the use of whole-cardiac cycle Pd/Pa for the guidance of

revascularization decisions.

3.2.3 Use of fractional flow reserve and pressure-derived
indices in patients with severe aortic stenosis
In patients with intermediate coronary stenosis and concomitant
severe aortic stenosis, although some observational studies exist (see
section 11), there are no adequate RCT data to support the use of
FFR or iwFR for the guidance of revascularization decisions.

3.2.4 Use of intravascular imaging for the diagnostic

assessment of stenosis

IVUS is an ultrasound-based modality of intravascular imaging with an
axial resolution of about 150 mm. IVUS imaging allows real-time
tomographic assessment of vessel size, lumen area, and plaque composition and volume. In comparison with optical coherence tomography (OCT), it has more limited spatial resolution, but better
penetration depth and potential advantages in terms of vessel sizing.
OCT is a light-based modality of intravascular imaging with higher
axial resolution compared with IVUS (15 vs. 150 mm). The disadvantages of OCT imaging are that it requires complete blood clearance
from the lumen for imaging and that it has more limited penetration,
which can limit the assessment of complete plaque burden and may
impair accurate vessel sizing.
Potential clinical uses of intravascular imaging for diagnostic assessment in patients being considered for myocardial revascularization
are the evaluation of stenosis severity in lesions with intermediategrade stenosis, evaluation of lesion morphology in lesions ambiguous
with angiographic assessment, and the characterization of plaque
composition. The majority of the existing data from clinical trials
relate to the use of intravascular imaging guidance during PCI and are
discussed in section 16. The use of intravascular imaging to evaluate
patients with stent failure is discussed in section 13.
Regarding the assessment of intermediate-grade stenosis, a number of studies have evaluated the optimal cut-off of minimal lumen
area for the identification of haemodynamically relevant lesions. One
prospective registry showed overall moderate correlation of minimal
lumen area with FFR values, with cut-off values for detecting haemodynamically relevant stenosis (<2.4, <2.7, and <3.6 mm2) dependent
on vessel size (reference vessel diameters <3.0, 3.0–3.5, and >3.5
mm, respectively). [34a] Generally, haemodynamic assessment with FFR
should be preferred for this indication.
The presence of intermediate-grade LMS disease is not infrequent
and angiographic assessment may be challenging. Assessment using

3.3 Gaps in the evidence
Further studies investigating the role of novel, combined, non-invasive anatomical and functional imaging are needed, such as randomized clinical trials with CT-FFR in patients with suspected and known
CAD, as well as further clinical investigation of perfusion CT.
Randomized trials comparing iwFR-based management of patients
with intermediate-grade stenosis compared with medical therapy are
missing. Further study of whole-cardiac cycle Pd/Pa for the guidance of
revascularization in the setting of randomized clinical trials is also
required.
Further studies including randomized trials are needed to assess
the value of functional vs. anatomical guidance for CABG.
### 4 Process for decision-making and patient information

4.1 Patient information and informed

consent

Informed consent requires transparency, especially if there is debate
over various treatment options. Active patient participation in the


IVUS evaluation of intermediate-grade LMS disease in patients being
considered for bypass surgery or PCI is supported by data from a
number of observational studies. [35][–][38] In a multicentre, prospective
study, revascularization was mainly deferred if the minimal luminal
area (MLA) was >_6 mm [2] and performed in cases of an MLA <6
mm [2] . [37] After a 2 year follow-up, cardiac death-free survival was similar in both groups (98 and 95%, respectively). Another study suggested that deferral of intervention in 131 patients with an MLA >_7.5
mm [2] showed favourable clinical outcomes. [36] In Asian patients with
generally smaller heart sizes, studies have suggested that an IVUS
MLA of 4.5–4.8 mm [2] may be the most appropriate. [38]




ESC/EACTS Guidelines 99


decision-making process should be encouraged. Patient information
needs to be unbiased, evidence-based, up-to-date, reliable, accessible,
relevant, and consistent with legal requirements. Use of terminology
that the patient understands is essential. Short-term procedurerelated and long-term risks and benefits—such as survival, relief of
angina, quality of life, the potential need for late reintervention, the
need for prevention measures, and uncertainties associated with different treatment strategies—should be thoroughly discussed.
Although current recommendations are mostly based on the ability
of treatments to reduce adverse events including mortality, there is
growing interest in patient-reported outcome measures. [40][,][41] Patients
are not only interested to know how recommended treatment
impacts on prognosis but also on their quality of life in the way they
perceive it. A written evidence-based patient information document
should be provided, potentially with decision aids.
Patients must have the time to reflect on the trade-offs imposed
by the outcome estimates. In order to seek a second opinion or to
discuss the findings and consequences with referring physicians,
enough time should be allowed—up to several days, as required—
between diagnostic catheterization and intervention. These recommendations pertain to patients in a stable condition, for whom various treatment options exist and who can make a decision without
the constraints of an urgent or emergent situation (Table 3). The
patient’s right to decline the treatment option recommended by the
Heart Team has to be respected. Patient refusal of a recommended
treatment should be acknowledged in a written document after the
patient has received the necessary information by the Heart Team
members. In this case, the patient may be offered an alternative treatment option by the Heart Team.
The patient has the right to obtain information on the level of
expertise of the operator, the workload of the centre, whether all
treatment options—including surgery—are available on-site, and
local results in the performance of percutaneous and surgical myocardial revascularization procedures. Patients considered for revascularization should also be clearly informed of the continuing need for
medical therapy, as well as lifestyle modification and other secondary
prevention strategies (see section 19). [42]

4.2 Multidisciplinary decision-making
(Heart Team)
The Heart Team—comprising clinical or non-invasive cardiologists,
cardiac surgeons, and interventional cardiologists, as well as anaesthetists and other specialists if deemed necessary—should provide a
balanced, multidisciplinary decision-making process. [43] Additional
input may be needed from other specialties involved in the care of
the patient. The Heart Team should meet on a regular basis to analyse and interpret the available diagnostic evidence, determine the
need for myocardial revascularization, and assess the relative shortand long-term safety and effectiveness of the percutaneous and surgical options. Ad hoc meetings of the Heart Team should facilitate and
support efficient clinical workflows.
The need for an interdisciplinary approach is underlined by reports


patients with CAD [44] and (ii) inappropriate use of revascularization
strategies with a lack of case discussions. [45] The marked variability in
PCI-to-CABG ratios between European countries (ranging from
2.4–7.6 in 2013, for example) has raised concerns regarding the
appropriate selection of revascularization strategies. [46] Rates for the
inappropriate use of PCI (10–15%) [43][,][47][,][48] and CABG (1–2%) are
reported. Multidisciplinary decision-making in a Heart Team can minimize specialty bias and prevent self-referral from interfering with
optimal patient care. [49]

Several reports from different centres have established that the
treatment recommendations made in multidisciplinary Heart Team
discussions are reproducible and implemented in the vast majority of
cases (93–95%). [50][,][51]

Interdisciplinary institutional protocols should be developed
for common case scenarios to avoid the need for systematic caseby-case review of all diagnostic angiograms. However, complex
cases—defined by the protocols—should be discussed individually. In these cases, revascularization should not be performed at
the time of diagnostic angiography, to allow sufficient time to
assess all available information and clearly explain and discuss the
findings with the patient. The rationale for a decision and consensus on the optimal revascularization treatment should be documented on the patient’s chart. In institutions without an on-site
cardiac surgery unit, collaboration with an external cardiac surgery unit is required to design protocols that define when Heart

Team discussion is needed.

4.3 Timing of revascularization
Patients requiring myocardial revascularization may be at increased
risk of adverse events during the waiting period. [52] A recent metaanalysis of observational studies calculated that a waiting period of 3
months for surgical myocardial revascularization may be associated
with the risk of 1 death among 80 patients. [53] Table 3 shows the preferred timing of revascularization depending on the clinical presentation and the extent and localization of CAD. [54] Sections 7 and 8 show

additional and more specific information in this regard for patients

with ACS.

Ad hoc PCI is defined as a therapeutic intervention performed
within the same procedure as the diagnostic coronary angiography.

Ad hoc PCI is convenient, often cost-effective and safe, and is associ
ated with fewer access site complications and lower radiation exposure. [55][,][56] However, in the USA, up to 30% of patients undergoing ad
hoc PCI are potential candidates for CABG. [56] This number may be
lower in Europe. [45] Although it is not advisable for ad hoc PCI to represent the default approach for complex SCAD, it may be justified if a
full diagnostic work-up, including functional testing, is available and
the patient is adequately informed on both percutaneous and surgical
myocardial revascularization options (see section 4.1). Institutional
protocols developed by the Heart Team in accordance with current
Guidelines should define specific anatomical criteria and clinical subsets that may be—or should not be—treated ad hoc. Stable patients
with complex CAD, as reflected by a high SYNTAX score, should in
general be discussed by the Heart Team and not be treated ad hoc.

receive guideline-recommended medical treatment are the persistence of symptoms despite medical treatment and/or the improvement of prognosis. [1]

Several studies have shown that myocardial revascularization by
PCI or CABG more effectively relieves angina, reduces the use of
anti-anginal drugs, and improves exercise capacity and quality of life
compared with a strategy of medical therapy alone during short- and
[long-term follow-up (Supplementary Table 1).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data) [32][,][33][,][57][–][62] Recently, the
ORBITA (Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation with optimal
medical Therapy of Angioplasty in stable angina) trial randomly compared PCI with placebo (sham procedure) in patients with SCAD
due to single-vessel CAD (diameter stenosis >70%) and preserved
LV function in the presence of moderate symptoms of angina

[Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class II in 59% of patients,
duration 9 months] for the first time. [63] After 6 weeks of medication
optimization (mean number of anti-anginal drugs: 3) and baseline cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 200 patients were randomized (105
PCI and 95 placebo). Following a 6-week post-randomization period,
the primary endpoint of increment in exercise time was not significantly different, but estimates were imprecise (PCI minus placebo


(-0.09, 95% CI -0.15 to -0.04, P = 0.001). ORBITA raises the issue of
whether the symptom relief of PCI in the specific setting of stable
single-vessel CAD may be related at least in part to a placebo effect.
Limitations of the study, as acknowledged by the investigators and
outlined elsewhere, include the short observation period (6 weeks),
the inclusion of patients with mild symptoms pre-randomization
(CCS class 0-I in 25% of patients), the group imbalance in ostial and
proximal lesions (37 vs. 57%, P = 0.005), loss to follow-up after randomization, and the insufficient power to detect a true difference. [64]

This precludes definite conclusions at this stage. Nevertheless, the
ORBITA study underlines the value of optimal medical therapy in the
management of SCAD.
Three year follow-up of the FAME 2 study indicated yearly and
sustained improvement of angina (10.2 vs. 28.5% at 1 month and 5.2
vs. 9.7% at 3 years) in favour of FFR-guided PCI, despite considerable
crossover in the medical therapy arm. [33] Among patients with multivessel disease, the assessment of frequency of angina and quality of
life measures in the SYNTAX, FREEDOM (Future Revascularization
Evaluation in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus), and EXCEL (Evaluation
of XIENCE Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness
of Left Main Revascularization) trials consistently showed early and
sustained improvement for both PCI and CABG during long-term follow-up. [65][–][67]

5.2.1 Revascularization with the use of percutaneous
coronary intervention
Several meta-analyses comparing a strategy of PCI with initial medical
therapy among patients with SCAD found no or only modest benefits in terms of survival or MI for an invasive strategy, taking into
account the fact that up to 40% of patients crossed over after to
revascularization during longer-term follow-up. [91][,][98][,][99] A network
meta-analysis of 100 trials with 93 553 patients and 262 090 patientyears of follow-up comparing a strategy of initial medical therapy
with revascularization reported improved survival using PCI with
new-generation DES (everolimus: rate ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.59–0.96;
zotarolimus: rate ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.42–1.00) compared with initial
medical treatment. [100]

In the FAME 2 trial, [32] patients with SCAD and at least one functionally significant stenosis (invasive FFR <_0.80) were randomly
assigned to medical therapy or medical therapy plus FFR-guided PCI
using new-generation DES. The 3 year report of the FAME 2 trial
reported a lower incidence of the primary composite endpoints of
death, MI, and urgent revascularization (10.1 vs. 22.0%; P <0.001),
driven by a lower incidence of urgent revascularization in the PCI
group (4.3 vs. 17.2%; P <0.001) and without significant differences in
the rates of death and MI. [33] At 2 years of follow-up, the rate of death
or MI was lower in the PCI than the medical therapy group (4.6 vs.
8.0%; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32–0.97, P = 0.04) in a landmark analysis
between 8 days and 2 years of follow-up, whereas event rates were
higher during days 0 - 7 due to periprocedural MI (for overview of
[studies see Supplementary Table 2).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data) [97]

5.2.2 Revascularization with the use of coronary artery
bypass grafting
The superiority of CABG over a strategy of initial medical therapy
was established in a meta-analysis of seven RCTs [68] more than two



with SCAD and left main (LM) or three-vessel disease, particularly
when the proximal LAD coronary artery was involved, and has been
corroborated in more recent studies. [100][,][101] A network meta-analysis
of 100 trials with 93 553 patients comparing a strategy of initial medical therapy with revascularization reported improved survival (RR
0.80, 95% CI 0.63–0.99) and a reduced risk of MI (RR 0.79, 95% CI
0.83–0.99) among patients undergoing CABG compared with initial
medical treatment. [100]

In the STICH trial, 1212 patients with CAD and an LV ejection
fraction (LVEF) <_35% were randomized to initial medical therapy or
CABG. The extended 10 year follow-up of the STICH trial reported
a significant reduction in all-cause (59 vs. 66%; HR 0.84, 95% CI
0.73–0.97; P ¼ 0.02) and cardiovascular mortality (41 vs. 49%; HR
0.79, 95% CI 0.66–0.93; P ¼ 0.006). [81] For an overview of studies, see

5.3 Percutaneous coronary intervention
vs. coronary artery bypass grafting
The recommendations for the type of revascularization (CABG or
PCI) in patients with SCAD with suitable coronary anatomy for both
procedures and low predicted surgical mortality are summarized

below. The Heart Team should take into consideration the individual

cardiac and extracardiac characteristics, in addition to patient preference, in the overall decision-making process (Figure 3). A summary of
trials comparing the outcomes of patients treated with angioplasty vs.
CABG and bare-metal stent (BMS) vs. CABG is shown in

Table 4.

5.3.1 Criteria for decision-making
Predicted surgical mortality, the anatomical complexity of CAD, and
the anticipated completeness of revascularization are important criteria for decision-making with respect to the type of revascularization


In the FAME 2 trial, [32] patients with SCAD and at least one functionally significant stenosis (invasive FFR <_0.80) were randomly
assigned to medical therapy or medical therapy plus FFR-guided PCI
using new-generation DES. The 3 year report of the FAME 2 trial
reported a lower incidence of the primary composite endpoints of
death, MI, and urgent revascularization (10.1 vs. 22.0%; P <0.001),
driven by a lower incidence of urgent revascularization in the PCI
group (4.3 vs. 17.2%; P <0.001) and without significant differences in
the rates of death and MI. [33] At 2 years of follow-up, the rate of death
or MI was lower in the PCI than the medical therapy group (4.6 vs.
8.0%; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32–0.97, P = 0.04) in a landmark analysis
between 8 days and 2 years of follow-up, whereas event rates were
higher during days 0 - 7 due to periprocedural MI (for overview of
[studies see Supplementary Table 2).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data) [97]


5.2.2 Revascularization with the use of coronary artery
bypass grafting
The superiority of CABG over a strategy of initial medical therapy
was established in a meta-analysis of seven RCTs [68] more than two
decades ago, demonstrating a survival benefit of CABG in patients

(CABG or PCI). Whether conservative therapy, PCI, or CABG is
preferred should depend on the risk-benefit ratios of these treatment
strategies, weighing up the risks of periprocedural complications (e.g.

cerebrovascular events, blood transfusions, renal failure, new onset

arrhythmias, or wound infections) against improvements in healthrelated quality of life, as well as long-term freedom from death, MI, or
repeat revascularization.

5.3.1.1 Predicted surgical mortality
To assess the predicted surgical mortality, the European System for
[Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE II) (www.euroscore.](http://www.euroscore.org/calc.html)
[org/calc.html) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score](http://www.euroscore.org/calc.html)
[(http://riskcalc.sts.org) were both developed based on clinical varia-](http://riskcalc.sts.org)
bles to estimate the operative in-hospital or 30 day mortality
risk [108][–][110] [(Supplementary Table 4). Both scores have demonstrated](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
their value in specific cohorts of patients undergoing CABG. [111]

Calibration of the STS score is updated on a regular basis. It has been
suggested that the STS score outperforms the EuroSCORE II when
compared directly in a cohort of CABG patients, [112] although other
studies have found comparable performance of both models. [113][,][114]

There are no established cut-offs for low predicted surgical mortality based on the EuroSCORE II or STS score. Thus, individualized
treatment decisions are needed. These decisions should respect the
range of predicted surgical risks in the major RCTs that inform the
choice of revascularization modality (Table 5). In these studies,
the predicted surgical risk was assessed by the logistic EuroSCORE.
Compared with the more recent EuroSCORE II, the logistic
EuroSCORE has similar discrimination but poorer calibration and,
thus, overestimates surgical mortality by roughly two-fold. [115]

Despite the usefulness of these scores, there is not a single risk
model that provides perfect risk assessment because the scores are
limited by (i) the specific definitions used or the methodology applied,
(ii) the absence of important variables such as frailty, (iii) the practicability of calculation, (iv) a failure to reflect all relevant mortality and
morbidity endpoints, and (v) limited external validation. Decisionmaking should not be solely dependent on risk scores. These scores
should be used as a guide within the multidisciplinary Heart Team

discussion.

To combine clinical and anatomical risk estimation, the SYNTAX II
score was retrospectively derived from the SYNTAX cohort [127] and
subsequently externally validated. [120][,][128][,][129] Nevertheless, compared
with the SYNTAX score, its value in assigning patients to PCI or
CABG is less well investigated. The fact that the SYNTAX II score
failed to predict the outcome of the EXCEL trial raises additional
concern. [130]

[disease (Table 6 and Supplementary Table 4).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data) [116] In the cohort of
the SYNTAX trial, and subsequently in external validation cohorts,
the SYNTAX score was found to be an independent predictor of
long-term major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events
(MACCE) and of death in patients treated with PCI but not
CABG. [117][–][120]

In the SYNTAX trial, tertiles of SYNTAX score with low, inter
mediate, and high anatomical complexity stratified patients into those

who had similar outcomes with both PCI and CABG and those who
derived significant benefit from CABG. [121][–][123] In subsequent RCTs,

the interaction of the strata of SYNTAX score with the effect of the

randomized treatment was less pronounced and did not reach statistical significance. [105][–][107] However, in a recent collaborative individual
patient pooled analysis of randomized trials including 11518
patients, [124] the test for trend across the ordered tertiles of the
SYNTAX score of the SYNTAX study was positive at P = 0.0011
(unpublished analysis), confirming the strata of the SYNTAX score as

an effect modifier to be considered. There is concern about bias and
inter-individual variability in calculating the SYNTAX score. [125] This
should be minimized by adequate training.

5.3.1.3 Completeness of revascularization
The aim of myocardial revascularization is to minimize residual
ischaemia. In support of this concept, the nuclear substudy of the
COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and
Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial demonstrated an incremental benefit in reducing the risk of death and MI by reducing residual stressinduced ischaemia from >10% of the myocardium to <_5%. [86]

In the SYNTAX trial, anatomical complete revascularization was
defined as PCI or bypass of all epicardial vessels with a diameter
exceeding >_1.5 mm and a luminal reduction of >_50% in at least one
angiographic view. [131] A meta-analysis of 89 883 patients enrolled in
RCTs and observational studies revealed a lower long-term mortality
(RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65–0.77, P <0.001), MI (RR 0.78, 95% CI
0.68–0.90; P = 0.001), and repeat myocardial revascularization (RR
0.74, 95% CI 0.65–0.83; P <0.001) by complete revascularization
(based on anatomical definition in 87% of the patients) as compared
with incomplete revascularization. [132] The benefit of complete revascularization was independent of the treatment modality. A more
recent meta-analysis suggested enhanced benefit when complete
revascularization is performed with state-of-the-art techniques in
high-risk patients. [133] Likewise, in a post hoc analysis of the SYNTAX
trial, anatomical incomplete revascularization was associated with
inferior long-term outcomes after both CABG and PCI. [131] A residual
SYNTAX score >8 after PCI was associated with significant increases
in the 5-year risk of death and of the composite of death, MI, and
stroke, and any residual SYNTAX score >0 was associated with the
risk of repeat intervention. [134] In an observational study from the
New York State registry that compared CABG with PCI using newgeneration DES [everolimus-eluting stent (EES)] in 9223 pairs of
propensity-matched patients with multivessel CAD, the significantly
higher risk of MI associated with PCI as compared with CABG was
not seen among matched pairs of patients in which the PCI group had
complete revascularization (P interaction = 0.02). [135] Consistent findings
were obtained in a pooled analysis of 3212 patients of the SYNTAX,



BEST (Randomised Comparison of Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery
and Everolimus-Eluting Stent Implantation in the Treatment of
Patients with Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease), and
PRECOMBAT (Premier of Randomised Comparison of Bypass
Surgery versus Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients
with Left Main Coronary Artery Disease) trials. [136] A mean SYNTAX
score of 27 and an LVEF of 59% were obtained. In a propensitymatched analysis, mortality and the composite risk of death, MI, and
stroke were significantly lower after PCI with complete vs. incomplete revascularization. After PCI with complete revascularization,
the risk of death or of the composite of death, MI, or stroke was not
significantly different from that after CABG with complete revascularization (adjusted HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.83–1.63, P = 0.39, and 1.14, 95%
CI 0.87–1.48, P = 0.35, respectively), whereas these risks were significantly elevated after PCI with incomplete revascularization.
Functional complete revascularization is achieved when all lesions
causing resting or stress-induced ischaemia are bypassed or treated
by PCI. Given the limitations of non-invasive imaging techniques (see
section 3), these lesions are identified by FFR or iwFR during diagnostic angiography. For PCI, the FAME study demonstrated that the
more restrictive selection of target lesions by functional guidance
conferred superior long-term outcomes compared with anatomically
guided lesion selection (see section 3). [31] In contrast, leaving functionally relevant lesions untreated resulted in a high rate of reinterventions in the FAME 2 study. [33] Based on the data of the FAME and
FAME 2 studies, complete revascularization based on the functional
definition is the preferred strategy for PCI.
The role of functional guidance for CABG is less clear. [28][,][137] One
of the potential benefits of CABG is protection against disease progression in proximal segments, which may be diminished by restricting the bypass targets to functionally relevant lesions. This has to be
weighed against the risk of bypass closure when native vessel flow is
high. Thus, for ambiguous lesions, functional testing may also help
guide the surgical revascularization strategy.

5.3.2 Isolated proximal left anterior descending coronary
artery disease
Comparing CABG and PCI among patients with isolated proximal
LAD disease, the available evidence suggests similar outcomes in
terms of death, MI, and stroke, but a higher risk of repeat revascularization with PCI. [68][,][70][,][73][,][101][,][139][–][144]

5.3.3 Left main coronary artery disease
The available evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses comparing
CABG with PCI using DES among patients with LM disease suggests
equivalent results for the safety composite of death, MI, and stroke
up to 5 years of follow-up. [148] A significant interaction with time is
notable, providing early benefit for PCI in terms of MI and periinterventional stroke, which is subsequently offset by a higher risk of
spontaneous MI during long-term follow-up. The need for repeat
revascularization is higher with PCI than with CABG.
The EXCEL trial compared CABG with PCI using new-generation
DES (EES) among 1905 patients with significant LM disease. [107] At 3
years of follow-up, the primary endpoint of death, stroke, or MI
occurred with similar frequency in the CABG and PCI group (14.7 vs.
15.4%; HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.79–1.26, P = 0.98). The pre-planned landmark analysis from 30 days to 3 years showed a significant difference
for the primary endpoint in favour of CABG (7.9 vs. 11.5%, P = 0.02).
The NOBLE (Nordic-Baltic-British Left Main Revascularization
Study) trial compared CABG with PCI using new-generation DES

[biolimus-eluting stents (BES)] among 1201 patients with significant
LM disease (mean SYNTAX score of 23). [106] At a median follow-up
of 3.1 years, the primary endpoint of death, non-procedural MI,
stroke, and repeat revascularization occurred more frequently in the
PCI than the CABG group (29 vs. 19%; HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11–1.96,
P = 0.007).
A recent collaborative individual patient pooled analysis of
randomized trials including 11 518 patients reviewed the currently
available evidence from randomized trials comparing CABG with PCI
for LM or multivessel disease. [124] The primary outcome was all-cause
mortality. In the overall cohort, CABG was associated with a significant survival benefit during a mean follow-up of 3.8 ± 1.4 years (5
year all-cause mortality 11.2% after PCI vs. 9.2% after CABG; HR
1.20, 95% CI 1.06–1.37, P = 0.0038). There was a linear trend for
HRs of death increasing with increasing SYNTAX tertiles [P = 0.0011
for trend (unpublished analysis)]. However, among 4478 patients
with LM disease, those randomly assigned to CABG or PCI with a
mean follow-up of 3.4 ± 1.4 years reported similar risks for the primary outcome all-cause mortality (PCI 10.7 vs. CABG 10.5%; HR
1.07, 95% CI 0.87–1.33, P = 0.52) at 5 years. There were no significant differences in mortality between PCI and CABG in subgroup
analyses according to SYNTAX scores. Nevertheless, in patients
with a high SYNTAX score, a trend towards better survival was
noted with CABG. The proportion of patients with a high SYNTAX
score was limited in view of the inclusion criteria of the respective

studies.

Current evidence indicates that PCI is an appropriate alternative

to CABG in LM disease and low-to-intermediate anatomical com
plexity. Among patients with LM disease and low anatomical complexity, there is evidence that the outcomes with respect to major
clinical endpoints are similar for PCI and CABG, resulting in a class I


anatomical complexity, the number of patients studied in RCTs is
low due to exclusion criteria; the risk estimates and CIs are imprecise, but suggest a trend towards better survival with CABG.
Therefore, PCI in this setting cannot be endorsed as reflected by a

class III recommendation. For PCI in LM with intermediate anatomical

complexity, the previous class IIa recommendation was maintained in
view of the incomplete 5 year follow-up of the two largest RCTs in
this setting.

5.3.4 Multivessel coronary artery disease
The observation of a survival advantage of CABG over PCI has been
consistent among patients with severe three-vessel CAD (intermediate to high SYNTAX score), and has been attributed at least in part
to the placement of bypass grafts to the mid coronary vessels providing prophylaxis against the development of new proximal disease.
The BEST trial, comparing CABG with PCI using new-generation
DES (EES) among patients with multivessel CAD (77% three-vessel
CAD and 23% two-vessel disease, mean SYNTAX score 24), prematurely stopped enrolment after the inclusion of 880 patients due to
slow recruitment. [105] At a median follow-up of 4.6 years, PCI was
associated with a higher incidence of the primary endpoint (death,
MI, and TVR) (15.3 vs. 10.6%; HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01–2.13, P = 0.04)
than CABG. The risk of death, MI, and stroke was not statistically different between the two treatment groups (11.9 vs. 9.5%; HR 1.26,
95% CI 0.84–1.89, P = 0.26), whereas repeat revascularization of any
vessel (11.0 vs. 5.4%; HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.28–3.41, P = 0.003) but not
target lesion revascularization (5.7 vs. 3.8%; HR 1.51, 95% CI
0.82–2.80, P = 0.19) was more frequent in the PCI group. CABG
resulted in more complete revascularization (71.5 vs. 50.9%;
P <0.001) and a lower incidence of revascularization for new lesions
(5.5 vs. 2.3%; HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.18–5.17, P = 0.01).
Consistent with findings in the overall cohort (see section 5.3.3),
the collaborative individual patient pooled analysis found that in 7040
patients with multivessel disease, those assigned to CABG had significantly lower 5 year all-cause mortality than those assigned to PCI
(PCI 11.5 vs. CABG 8.9%; HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09–1.49, P = 0.0019). [124]

Outcomes for the endpoint all-cause mortality were modified by two
variables, diabetes and disease complexity, as assessed by the
SYNTAX score. Compared with patients without diabetes (8.7 vs.
8.0%; HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.86–1.36, P = 0.49), mortality was higher after
PCI than CABG in patients with diabetes (15.5 vs. 10.0%; HR 1.48,
95% CI 1.19–1.84, P = 0.0004, P interaction = 0.045). There was a gradient of risk with a stepwise increase in mortality for PCI according
to SYNTAX score tertile (SYNTAX score 0 - 22: 10.5 vs. 8.4%; HR

1.11, 95% CI 0.77–1.62, P = 0.57; SYNTAX score 23- 32: 14.0 vs.

9.5%; HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.09–2.08, P =0.0129; SYNTAX score >32:

19.2 vs. 11.2%; HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.13–2.55, P = 0.0094).
An individual patient data pooled analysis of SYNTAX and BEST,
comparing CABG with PCI using DES among 1275 patients with multivessel disease in the absence of diabetes (89% three-vessel CAD,
mean SYNTAX score 26), reported a lower risk of death (6.0 vs.
9.3%; HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43–0.98, P = 0.04) and MI (3.3 vs. 8.3%; HR
0.40, 95% CI 0.24–0.65, P <0.001) in the CABG group at a median
follow-up of 61 months. [149] The risk of death was not significantly different among patients with a low (0- 22) SYNTAX score (6.0 vs.
7.5%, P = 0.66), whereas the benefit of CABG over PCI was greater
in patients with an intermediate-to-high (>22) SYNTAX score (7.1

110 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


vs. 11.6%, P = 0.02). Another individual patient data pooled analysis
of SYNTAX and BEST, comparing CABG with PCI using DES among
1166 patients with multivessel disease involving the proximal LAD
(88% three-vessel CAD, mean SYNTAX score 28), reported a higher
risk of the composite of death, MI, and stroke (16.3 vs. 11.5%; HR
1.43, 95% CI 1.05–1.96, P = 0.02), cardiac death, MI, and repeat revascularization in the PCI group at 5 years of follow-up. [147] Of note, outcomes were not significantly different for CABG and PCI for any
endpoint except for MI among the subgroup of patients with low
SYNTAX score (0- 22).
The available evidence suggests that in multivessel CAD without
diabetes and low anatomical complexity, PCI and CABG achieve similar long-term outcomes with respect to survival and the composite
of death, MI, and stroke, justifying a class I recommendation for PCI.
In patients with multivessel CAD and intermediate-to-high anatomical complexity, the two large trials using DES, SYNTAX and BEST,
found a significantly higher mortality and a higher incidence of death,

MI, and stroke with PCI in the absence of diabetes. Consistent results

were also obtained for patients with multivessel CAD in the recent
individual patient-level meta-analysis. [124] Thus, the previous class III

recommendation for PCI in multivessel CAD and intermediate-to
high complexity was maintained.

5.4 Gaps in the evidence
It remains to be determined whether revascularization by PCI
improves prognosis in patients with SCAD. The ISCHEMIA
(International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With
Medical and Invasive Approaches) study (NCT01471522) is currently
recruiting 5000 patients with SCAD and evidence of moderate-tosevere ischaemia detected by non-invasive imaging, who are randomized before coronary angiography to medical therapy or an invasive
strategy to detect differences in the primary endpoint of death or MI.
Current techniques rely on coronary angiography and the detection
of ischaemia-producing lesions. However, future adverse events are
related at least in part to non-flow limiting, vulnerable plaques. Better
identification of vulnerable plaques and the development of appropriate treatment strategies is needed. Along the same lines, the completeness and timing of revascularization are not well defined, and

neither are the roles of residual ischaemia and lesions. Moreover, we

need more research on the use of the SYNTAX and other scores for

informing treatment allocation, as well as dedicated trials in specific
subsets. Very long-term, extended follow-up (10 years) of trials comparing PCI and CABG, particularly in the setting of LM disease, will
provide further insights into the relative merits of both revascularization techniques.
### 6 Revascularization in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome

Myocardial revascularization in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) is addressed by prior Guidelines that are
endorsed by the current Task Force. [158] In the present Guidelines, we
discuss new evidence where previous recommendations require an



6.1 Early invasive vs. conservative
strategy
An invasive strategy has become the standard of care for high-risk
patients. [158] This approach allows prompt diagnosis of the underlying
CAD, identification of the culprit lesion, guidance for antithrombotic
management, and the assessment of the suitability of coronary anatomy for PCI or CABG. Numerous factors interplay in the decisionmaking process, including clinical presentation, comorbidities, risk
stratification (Figure 4), and high-risk features specific for a revascularization modality such as frailty, cognitive status, estimated life expectancy, and the functional and anatomical severity of CAD.
Up to 40% of NSTE-ACS patients with obstructive CAD present
with multiple complex plaques [159][–][162] and 25% with an acute
occluded coronary artery, [163] so that identification of the culprit
lesion may be challenging. Correlation with ECG or echo changes
and the use of OCT in the 25% of NSTE-ACS patients with angiographically normal epicardial coronary arteries [164][–][166] may be helpful
for identifying the culprit lesion, or rule out other mechanisms such
as dissection or haematomas [MI with non-obstructive coronary
arteries (MINOCA)]. [167][–][169]

A routine invasive strategy in NSTE-ACS has been shown to
improve clinical outcomes, [170] and benefit was mainly confined to
biomarker-positive patients [171] and patients with other high-risk features as defined in Figure 4. Of importance, the use of a radial
approach, new-generation DES, and more effective P2Y 12 -inhibitors
were not available or broadly implemented in these trials, and led to
a magnified benefit in frail ACS populations. [172][,][173]

6.2 Timing of angiography and
intervention

The current recommendations on the timing of angiography and intervention, as defined in Figure 4, are based on evidence discussed in detail
by the prior Guidelines on NSTE-ACS. [158] Specifically, a reduction in
recurrent or refractory ischaemia and length of hospital stay was
found with early intervention. [174][,][175] More recently, an updated collaborative meta-analysis on individual published and unpublished data
(n = 5324 patients with a median follow-up of 180 days) suggested
that early intervention might also be associated with decreased mortality. [176] This meta-analysis showed a statistical trend towards
decreased mortality with an early invasive strategy compared with a
delayed invasive strategy in unselected patients with NSTE-ACS (HR
0.81, 95% CI 0.64–1.03, P = 0.088). The survival benefit of the early
invasive strategy appeared more pronounced in high-risk subsets,
including elevated cardiac biomarkers at baseline (HR 0.76, 95% CI
0.58–0.996), diabetes (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45–0.99), a Global Registry
of Acute Coronary Events risk score >140 (HR 0.70, 95% CI
0.52–0.95), and age 75 years or older (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46–0.93),
although tests for interaction were inconclusive.

6.3 Type of revascularization
6.3.1 Percutaneous coronary intervention
6.3.1.1 Technical aspects
Implantation of new-generation DES is the standard treatment strategy even when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) cannot be sustained
beyond 1 month post-intervention [173][,][177][–][179] (see section 17),
and the radial approach has also become the standard of care. [172]

improves prognosis in patients with SCAD. The ISCHEMIA
(International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With

### 6 Revascularization in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome


Myocardial revascularization in patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) is addressed by prior Guidelines that are
endorsed by the current Task Force. [158] In the present Guidelines, we
discuss new evidence where previous recommendations require an
update.

ESC/EACTS Guidelines 111


DAPT is recommended for 12 months irrespective of stent type,
while in patients at high ischaemic risk not experiencing bleeding
events, DAPT may be extended (see section 17). There is no evidence for any additional benefit of thrombectomy in patients undergoing PCI in the setting of NSTE-ACS. [180] While FFR is considered
the invasive gold standard for the functional assessment of lesion
severity in SCAD, it has been shown to be feasible, reliable, safe, and
effective in NSTE-ACS patients with multivessel disease, although its
prognostic value is unclear. [22][,][137][,][181]

6.3.1.2 Revascularization strategies and outcomes
Complete revascularization of significant lesions should be attempted
in multivessel disease NSTE-ACS patients, given that it was mandated
in trials testing early vs. late intervention [171][,][182][,][183] and that the prog

nosis of patients with incomplete revascularization is known to be
worse. [131][,][184] In addition, it seems that complete one-stage revascularization is associated with better clinical outcome than multistage
PCI. [185] The risk of periprocedural complications of PCI defined as MI
or myocardial injury, as well as that of long-term ischaemia, remains
higher in NSTE-ACS than in stable patients. [186][,][187] For ACS patients
who have undergone PCI, revascularization procedures represent
the most frequent, most costly, and earliest causes for rehospitalization. [188][,][189] As in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), routine
treatment of non-culprit lesions during the primary intervention by
PCI is harmful in NSTE-ACS patients with cardiogenic shock, as
shown by the recently published CULPRIT-SHOCK (Culprit Lesion
Only PCI versus Multivessel PCI in Cardiogenic Shock) trial (see section 7.3). [190]

6.3.2 Coronary artery bypass grafting
Approximately 5–10% of NSTE-ACS patients require CABG, [191] and
they represent a challenging subgroup given their high-risk characteristics compared with patients undergoing elective CABG. [192] In the
absence of randomized data, optimal timing for non-emergent CABG
in NSTE-ACS patients should be determined individually. The risk of
ischaemic events possibly related to suboptimal antiplatelet therapy
while awaiting surgery is <0.1%, while that of perioperative bleeding
complications associated with platelet inhibitors is >10%. [193] In
patients with ongoing ischaemia or haemodynamic instability with an
indication for CABG, emergency surgery should be performed and
not postponed as a consequence of antiplatelet treatment exposure.

6.3.3 Percutaneous coronary intervention vs. coronary
artery bypass grafting
There is no randomized comparison of PCI vs. CABG in the specific
setting of NSTE-ACS. The currently available evidence indirectly suggests that the criteria applied to patients with SCAD to guide the
choice of revascularization modality should be applied to stabilized
patients with NSTE-ACS. [100][,][121][,][150][,][194] Recent individual-patients data
analysis from the BEST, PRECOMBAT, and SYNTAX studies compared the outcome of CABG with that of PCI in 1246 patients with
stabilized NSTE-ACS and multivessel or LM disease. [194] The 5 year


incidence of the primary outcome—the composite of death, MI, or
stroke—was significantly lower with CABG than with PCI (13.4 vs.
18%, P = 0.036). The findings of this meta-analysis were consistent
with the main findings of the studies included, thus supporting the
concept that the principles of SCAD should apply to stabilized
patients with NSTE-ACS as well.
For complex cases, Heart Team discussion and use of the
SYNTAX score are recommended, [195] given its ability to predict
death, MI, and revascularization in patients with NSTE-ACS and multivessel disease undergoing PCI. In patients with multivessel disease
and diabetes in particular, recent evidence suggests a greater benefit
of CABG vs. PCI. [196]

6.4 Gaps in the evidence
In the setting of NSTE-ACS, there are no dedicated prospective studies on the revascularization strategy with multivessel disease. Thus,

current recommendations on the choice of lesions to be treated and

treatment modality (PCI or CABG) are based on an analogy to findings obtained in SCAD or STEMI. Likewise, the prognostic role of
FFR and iwFR in guiding myocardial revascularization needs additional

clarification.
### 7 Revascularization in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction

Myocardial revascularization in patients with STEMI is addressed by
the 2017 ESC Guidelines on STEMI. After reviewing the subsequent

literature, the current Task Force endorses most recommendations
of these Guidelines. [198]

7.1 Time delays
Delays in the timely implementation of reperfusion therapy are key
issues in the management of STEMI. Detailed recommendations on
timelines, logistics, and pre-hospital management have been provided
in the recent ESC STEMI Guidelines (Figure 5). [198]

A recent analysis of 12 675 STEMI patients in the FITT-STEMI
(Feedback Intervention and Treatment Times in ST-Elevation
Myocardial Infarction) trial emphasizes the strong impact of time



shock or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. [199] In shock without out-ofhospital cardiac arrest, every 10 min treatment delay between

60–180 min from the first medical contact resulted in 3.3 additional

deaths per 100 PCI-treated patients, and in 1.3 additional deaths after
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without cardiogenic shock. In stable
STEMI patients, time delays were substantially less relevant (0.3 additional deaths per 100 PCI-treated patients for every 10 min delay
between 60–180 min from the first medical contact). Thus, high-risk
STEMI patients with cardiogenic shock or out-of-hospital cardiac
arrest are those who benefit most from expediting all steps of the
care pathway.

7.2 Selection of reperfusion strategy
Primary PCI, defined as percutaneous catheter intervention in the
setting of STEMI without previous fibrinolysis, is the preferred reperfusion strategy. It has replaced fibrinolysis in patients with STEMI, provided it can be performed in a timely manner in high-volume PCI
centres with experienced operators and 24 h/7 days a week catheterization laboratory activation. [198][,][200][,][201] In settings where primary
PCI cannot be performed in a timely fashion, fibrinolysis should be
administered as soon as possible. If first medical contact (FMC) is
out-of-hospital, lysis should be implemented pre-hospital (e.g. in the
ambulance) (Figure 5). [202][–][206] It should be followed by transfer to
PCI-capable centres for routine coronary angiography in all patients,
and should be performed without delay for rescue PCI in the case of
unsuccessful fibrinolysis or within 2–24 h after bolus administration. [198] Emergency CABG may be indicated in selected STEMI
patients unsuitable for PCI.

ESC/EACTS Guidelines 113


7.3 Primary percutaneous coronary
intervention

Key points for optimizing and guiding primary PCI are summarized

below.

The infarct-related artery (IRA) should be systematically treated
during the initial intervention. Patients with extensive CAD in vessels
remote from the IRA have an adverse prognosis following primary
PCI. [207] Staged PCI in patients with multivessel disease and no haemodynamic compromise is an independent predictor of survival, and
more frequent ischaemic events have been reported in direct vs.
staged revascularization of STEMI patients with multivessel


Four major randomized trials-PRAMI (Preventive Angioplasty in
Acute Myocardial Infarction), [211] CvLPRIT (Complete Versus LesionOnly Primary PCI trial), [212] DANAMI-3-PRIMULTI (The Third
DANish Study of Optimal Acute Treatment of Patients with STsegment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: PRImary PCI in
MULTIvessel Disease), [213] and Compare-Acute [214] -have consistently
shown a benefit of complete revascularization (performed immediately or staged) as compared with IRA-only PCI in patients with
[STEMI and multivessel disease (for details see the Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
[Data). A recent meta-analysis of 10 trials has shown that complete](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
revascularization was associated with a lower risk of MACE (RR 0.57,
95% CI 0.42–0.77), due to a lower risk of urgent revascularization

114 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


(RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30–0.66), with no significant difference in mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52–1.12) or MI (RR 0.54, 95% CI
0.23–1.27). [215] This meta-analysis did not include Compare-Acute.
Yet, similar to earlier studies, the benefit of complete revascularization over culprit-only revascularization seen in Compare-Acute was
driven by a lower need for unplanned reintervention, whereas the

incidences of death and recurrent MI were similar between the two
strategies. [214]

Most of the studies support the concept of full revascularization
either during the initial hospital stay for STEMI or a staged admission, [215] but it remains to be determined how clinicians can identify
lesions that should be revascularized beyond the culprit lesion and
whether complete revascularization should be performed in singleor multi-stage procedures. Moreover, there is a lack of evidence on
the optimal timing of staged procedures. In most of the studies,
staged procedures were performed during the initial hospital stay. At
present, one-stage multivessel PCI during STEMI without cardiogenic
shock should be considered in patients in the presence of multiple,
critical stenoses or highly unstable lesions (angiographic signs of possible thrombus or lesion disruption), and if there is persistent ischaemia after PCI on the supposed culprit lesion.
In patients with multivessel disease and AMI with cardiogenic
shock, the recently published CULPRIT-SHOCK trial showed that a
strategy with PCI of the culprit lesion only with possible staged revascularization determined a lower 30 day risk of the composite of allcause mortality or severe renal failure compared with immediate
multivessel PCI. [190] This was driven by a significant risk reduction in
30 day all-cause mortality by the culprit lesion-only strategy compared with immediate multivessel PCI (43.3 vs. 51.6%; HR 0.84, 95%
CI 0.72–0.98, P = 0.03). These findings need to be interpreted in light
of a low 12.5% (43 out of 344 patients) crossover rate from culprit
lesion-only to immediate multivessel PCI based on physicians’ judgment. Based on these findings, culprit lesion-only PCI is recommended as the default strategy in patients with AMI with cardiogenic
shock. A more detailed discussion of the revascularization strategy in
[MI patients with cardiogenic shock is found in the Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)

[Data.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)

In patients with STEMI, DES (in particular new-generation DES)
have demonstrated better efficacy as compared with BMS and should
be used as the default strategy in STEMI patients, even when DAPT
cannot be sustained beyond 1 month. [177][,][178][,][216][–][218] (see section
16.1.2). As discussed in section 16.4, radial access is preferred over

femoral access.

Delaying stenting in primary PCI has been investigated as an option
to reduce microvascular obstruction (MVO) and preserve microcirculatory function in two small trials with conflicting results. [219][,][220]

More recently, in the larger deferred vs. conventional stent implantation in patients with STEMI [The Third DANish Study of Optimal
Acute Treatment of Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial
Infarction: DEFERred stent implantation in connection with primary
PCI (DANAMI 3-DEFER)] trial in 1215 STEMI patients, there was no
effect on the primary clinical outcome (composite of death, non-fatal


median follow-up of 42 months. [221] Routine deferred stenting was
associated with a higher risk of TVR.
Thrombus aspiration has been proposed as an adjunct during primary PCI to further improve epicardial and myocardial reperfusion
by the prevention of distal embolization of thrombotic material and
plaque debris. [222] Two landmark RCTs, which were adequately powered to detect the superiority of routine manual thrombus aspiration

vs. conventional PCI, showed no benefit on clinical outcomes of the

routine aspiration strategy overall or in any subgroup of patients indicating high thrombotic risk. [223][–][226] A safety concern emerged in
TOTAL (Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy with PCI versus
PCI Alone in Patients with STEMI) trial with an increase in the risk of
stroke. [225][,][227] Taken together, these results suggest that the routine
use of thrombus aspiration is not indicated. In the high-thrombus burden subgroup, the trend towards reduced cardiovascular death and
increased stroke/transient ischaemic attack (TIA) provides a rationale
for future trials of improved thrombus aspiration technologies in this
high-risk subgroup (although statistical tests did not support significant subgroup interaction). [228]

7.4 Percutaneous coronary intervention
after thrombolysis and in patients with
late diagnosis
The benefits of early, routine PCI after thrombolysis were seen in the
absence of an increased risk of adverse events (stroke or major
bleeding). Based on data from the four most recent trials, all of which
had a median delay between the start of thrombolysis and angiography of 2–6 h, a time frame of 2–24 h after successful lysis is recommended. [206][,][229][–][231] In cases of failed fibrinolysis, or if there is evidence
of re-occlusion or reinfarction with recurrence of ST-segment elevation, the patient should undergo immediate coronary angiography
and rescue PCI. [232] Patients presenting between 12 and 48 h after the
onset of symptoms, even if pain free and with stable haemodynamics,
may still benefit from early coronary angiography and possibly
PCI. [233][,][234] In patients presenting days after the acute event with a
completed MI, only those with recurrent angina or documented
residual ischaemia—and proven viability on non-invasive imaging in a
large myocardial territory—may be considered for revascularization
when the infarct artery is occluded. Routine late PCI of an occluded
IRA after MI in stable patients has no incremental benefit over medical therapy. [235]

7.5 Gaps in the evidence
Patients undergoing primary PCI benefit from full revascularization,
but the optimal timing of treatment of the non-culprit lesion is not
known. More studies evaluating the assessment of non-culprit lesions
by FFR or iwFR at the time of acute PCI, and studies investigating
whether intravascular imaging guidance of primary PCI can improve
the outcomes of STEMI patients, are needed. Future trials of
improved thrombus aspiration technologies may address the role of
this strategy in patients with high-risk features, such as large thrombus
burden. [228]

### 8 Myocardial revascularization in patients with heart failure

8.1 Chronic heart failure

8.1.1 Recommendations for myocardial revascularization
in patients with chronic heart failure
When compared with medical therapy alone, coronary revascularization is superior in improving survival in patients with HF of ischaemic
origin and is recommended in clinical practice. [81][,][248] However, the
optimal revascularization strategy is not defined. The choice between
CABG and PCI should be made by the Heart Team after careful evaluation of the patient’s clinical status and coronary anatomy, expected
completeness of revascularization (see section 5.3.1.3), myocardial
viability, coexisting valvular disease, and comorbidities.
Considerations relating to the need for viability testing prior to revas
cularization are discussed in section 3.

Randomized clinical trial data comparing revascularization with
medical therapy exists only for CABG in the setting of the STICH
trial. [81] One analysis from this trial showed that CABG can be performed with acceptable 30 day mortality rates (5.1%) in patients with
LV dysfunction (LVEF <_35%). [249] Extended follow-up in the STICH
Extension Study (STICHES) supports a significant survival benefit of
CABG combined with medical therapy vs. medical therapy alone in a
10 year observation period. [81]

There are currently no dedicated randomized clinical trials comparing PCI vs. medical therapy in patients with HF with reduced EF
(HFrEF). In addition, CABG vs. PCI randomized trials have excluded
patients with severe HF. In one prospective registry including 4616
patients with multivessel disease and severe HFrEF, propensity
score-matched comparison revealed similar survival (mean follow-up
2.9 years) with PCI (using EES) vs. CABG. [250] PCI was associated with
a higher risk of MI, particularly in patients with incomplete revascularization, and repeat revascularization. CABG was associated with a
higher risk of stroke. The conclusion of the study was that multivessel


revascularization with medical therapy in patients with an EF <_40%
showed that there was a significant mortality reduction with CABG
(HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.61–0.72, P <0.001) and PCI (HR 0.73, 95% CI
0.62–0.85, P <0.001) vs. medical therapy, though these finding are
limited by the predominantly observational nature of the included
studies and missing information on the completeness of
revascularization. [248]

A recent observational study investigated outcomes with PCI or
CABG for multivessel CAD and LV dysfunction in 1738 propensitymatched patients with diabetes mellitus. [251] Similar to the findings in
the absence of LV dysfunction, when CABG was compared with PCI
it was associated with a significantly lower risk of MACE, which
included a significant reduction in mortality. Event curves separated
early during the first year and continued to separate out to 12 years.
PCI should be considered in older patients without diabetes in
whom complete revascularization can be achieved, whereas CABG is
preferred in younger patients with more extensive CAD or those
with diabetes. In patients with diabetes and LV moderate or severe
dysfunction (EF <50%), CABG is associated with better long-term
survival and reduced incidence of MACCE. [250][,][251]

8.1.2 Ventricular reconstruction and aneurysm resection
The aim of surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) is to restore
physiological volume, and achieve an elliptical shape of the LV, by scar
resection and LV wall reconstruction on a mannequin of predefined
size. The aim of ventricular aneurysmectomy is to remove fibrous

scars in cases of severe dilatation, thrombus formation, or as a source

of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
The STICH trial revealed no difference in the primary outcome
(total mortality or cardiac hospitalization) between patients randomly allocated to CABG vs. combined CABG and SVR. [252]

Subgroup analyses of patients with a less dilated LV and better LVEF
showed benefit from SVR. [253] In the STICH trial, a post-operative LV
end-systolic volume index <_70 mL/m [2], after CABG plus SVR,
resulted in improved survival compared with CABG alone. [252][,][254] In
experienced centres, SVR may be done at the time of CABG if HF

symptoms are more predominant than angina, and if myocardial scar
and moderate LV remodelling are present.

8.2 Acute heart failure and cardiogenic
shock

Acute myocardial ischaemia in the setting of AMI is the antecedent
event for the majority of patients with cardiogenic shock undergoing
percutaneous revascularization. Mechanical complications—such as
papillary muscle rupture with severe mitral valve regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, or free wall rupture—are additional precipitat
ing causes.

8.2.1 Revascularization

The SHOCK (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded



patients with cardiogenic shock complicating AMI, emergency revascularization with PCI or CABG improved long-term survival when
compared with initial intensive medical therapy. All-cause mortality
at 6 months was lower in the group assigned to revascularization
than in the medically treated patients (50.3 vs. 63.1%, respectively;
RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65–0.98, P = 0.03). [258]

The revascularization strategy for patients with cardiogenic shock

and multivessel disease is addressed in section 7.

A subanalysis of the SHOCK trial comparing patients treated with

CABG or PCI showed similar survival rates between the two subgroups. [259] There were more patients with diabetes (48.9 vs. 26.9%;
P = 0.02), three-vessel disease (80.4 vs. 60.3%; P = 0.03), and LM coronary disease (41.3 vs. 13.0%; P = 0.001) in the CABG group. The
findings of this non-randomized comparison suggest that CABG
should be considered in patients with cardiogenic shock who have
suitable anatomy, particularly if successful PCI is not feasible.

8.2.2 Mechanical circulatory support
Short-term MCS devices that are currently available are the intraaortic balloon pump (IABP), veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO), and percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (pLVADs). Short-term MCS may be considered in refractory cardiogenic shock depending on patient age, comorbidities, neurological
function, and the prospects for long-term survival and quality of life.

8.2.2.1 Intra-aortic balloon pump
IABPs are low-cost devices that are easy to insert and remove. They
moderately increase cardiac output and coronary and cerebral perfusion, while decreasing ventricular workload. In patients with cardiogenic shock complicating acute MI, the IABP-SHOCK II (Intraaortic
Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock II) randomized trial (600 patients)
showed that the use of IABPs did not reduce 30 day mortality and that
there was no evidence of long-term benefit. [260][,][261] A recent Cochrane
review of seven trials (790 patients) showed that IABPs may have a
beneficial effect on some haemodynamic parameters but did not result
in survival benefits. [262] Thus, the routine use of IABPs in patients with
cardiogenic shock complicating acute MI is not recommended.

8.2.2.2 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
Veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO), also known as extracorporeal life
support (ECLS), in its current form is a modified form of cardiopulmonary bypass. It decompresses the venous system; increases coronary, cerebral, and peripheral perfusion; and also provides
supplementary blood oxygenation. When performed percutaneously, it does not allow for LV decompression and leads to increasing

LV afterload.

In patients with cardiac arrest, evidence from observational trials
supports better survival in patients treated with VA-ECMO compared with those without. [263] When compared with IABP, VAECMO provides superior circulatory support. [264][,][265] Moreover, a
meta-analysis of observational studies suggested that in patients with
cardiogenic shock post-ACS, VA-ECMO showed a 33% higher 30
day survival compared with IABP [95% CI 14–52%, P <0.001; number
needed to treat (NNT) 13]. [263] However, the low number of patients
included in the analysed studies and the non-random treatment allocation are important limitations.



























8.2 Acute heart failure and cardiogenic
shock

Acute myocardial ischaemia in the setting of AMI is the antecedent
event for the majority of patients with cardiogenic shock undergoing
percutaneous revascularization. Mechanical complications—such as
papillary muscle rupture with severe mitral valve regurgitation, ventricular septal defect, or free wall rupture—are additional precipitat
ing causes.


8.2.1 Revascularization

The SHOCK (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded
Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) trial demonstrated that in

118 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


8.2.2.3 Percutaneous left ventricular assist devices
The majority of clinical experience with currently available pLVADs
is limited to two types of device: (i) a transaortic microaxial pump
(Impella) that directly unloads the LV providing 2.5 - 5 L/min blood
flow and (ii) a transseptal centrifugal assist device (TandemHeart)

that unloads the LV via a cannula introduced into the left atrium

through a transseptal puncture.
A recent meta-analysis on MCS in cardiogenic shock included four
randomized trials investigating the efficacy and safety of pLVADs vs.
IABP, and demonstrated similar short-term mortality despite initial
beneficial effects on arterial blood pressure and peripheral perfusion,
measured by serum lactate levels. [266] In all trials, a higher rate of
bleeding from vascular access sites and a significantly higher incidence
of limb ischaemia following pLVAD was noted. Similar outcomes


were noted in an RCT of high-risk PCI in patients with impaired LV
function. The 30 day incidence of major adverse events was not different for patients with pLVAD vs. IABP. [267]

In summary, the evidence for pLVAD is insufficient to provide a
recommendation on its clinical use in cardiogenic shock.

8.2.2.4 Surgically implanted left ventricular assist devices
There are limited data on surgically-implanted LV assist device
(LVAD) therapy in patients with AMI and cardiogenic shock. One
multicentre registry showed that despite being more critically ill prior
to implantation, patients with acute MI managed with LVAD had outcomes similar to other LVAD populations. [268]

A suggested algorithm for the management of patients with cardiogenic shock is shown in Figure 6.

### 9 Revascularization in patients with diabetes

Patients with diabetes mellitus have a higher prevalence of CAD,
which often manifests earlier in life and confers a substantially worse
prognosis than for patients without diabetes. [270] Patients with diabetes who have suffered an MI have a worse prognosis, particularly
those requiring treatment with insulin, and the presence of diabetes
amplifies the risk of any cardiovascular event. [271] Diabetes mellitus is
present in 25–30% of patients admitted with ACS and in up to 40%


The anatomical pattern of CAD in patients with diabetes clearly
influences their prognosis and response to revascularization.
Angiographic studies have demonstrated that patients with diabetes
are more likely to have LM disease and multivessel CAD, with more
diffuse disease involving smaller vessels. [273] In addition, patients with
diabetes have a greater atherosclerotic burden and an increased
number of lipid-rich plaques, which are prone to rupture, [274][,][275] and
those with unstable angina have more fissured plaques and intracoronary thrombi. [276] Patients with diabetes undergoing revascularization,
either with CABG or PCI, are at greater risk of kidney injury than
patients without diabetes.

9.1 Evidence for myocardial
revascularization

In patients with diabetes, the indications for myocardial revascularization are the same as those in patients without diabetes (see sections
5, 6, and 7). A meta-analysis of nine RCTs with 9904 ACS patients did

not show an interaction between diabetic status and the benefit from
invasive management and revascularization. [277] Yet, absolute risk
reductions were larger in the diabetic subsets compared with nondiabetic subsets. Consistent with the findings in the absence of diabetes, the adverse impact of incomplete revascularization in patients
with diabetes was also demonstrated in the BARI-2D (Bypass
Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) trial. [278]

Data from randomized trials on revascularization in patients with
[diabetes are summarized in Supplementary Table 5.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)

9.2 Type of myocardial revascularization
The selection of the optimal myocardial revascularization strategy for
patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD requires particular consideration. The recommendations are provided in section 5.

9.2.1. Randomized clinical trials

The FREEDOM trial compared elective revascularization with CABG
or PCI with first-generation DES (94%) in 1900 patients with diabetes
(6% of the screened population) with multivessel disease but without
LM stenosis. [150] The primary endpoint of any-cause death, non-fatal
MI, or stroke at 5 years occurred in 26.6% in the PCI group, compared with 18.7% in the CABG group (absolute difference 7.9%, 95%
CI 3.3–12.5%, P = 0.005). The incidences of death (16.3% in the PCI
group vs. 10.9% in the CABG group; absolute difference 5.4%, 95%
CI 1.5–9.2%, P = 0.049) and MI (13.9% in the PCI group vs. 6.0% in
the CABG group, P <0.001) were higher in the PCI group, but the
incidence of stroke was lower (2.4 vs. 5.2%; P =0.03). Within the
FREEDOM trial at 5 years, patients with diabetes treated with insulin
had higher event rates, but there was no significant interaction of
treatment and insulin requirement for the primary endpoint
(P interaction = 0.40), even after adjusting for SYNTAX score: the NNT
with CABG vs. PCI to prevent one event was 12.7 for insulin-treated
patients and 13.2 in those not requiring insulin. [279]

VACARDS (Veterans Affairs Coronary Artery Revascularization
in Diabetes Study) compared CABG with PCI in patients with diabetes and extensive CAD in the USA. [154] Only 198 patients with diabetes were randomized due to early termination of the study. The

combined risk of death or non-fatal MI was 18.4% for the CABG arm
and 25.3% for the PCI arm (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.47–1.71, P <0.05). [154]




























### 9 Revascularization in patients with diabetes


Patients with diabetes mellitus have a higher prevalence of CAD,
which often manifests earlier in life and confers a substantially worse
prognosis than for patients without diabetes. [270] Patients with diabetes who have suffered an MI have a worse prognosis, particularly
those requiring treatment with insulin, and the presence of diabetes
amplifies the risk of any cardiovascular event. [271] Diabetes mellitus is
present in 25–30% of patients admitted with ACS and in up to 40%
of patients undergoing CABG. [272]

120 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


In the CARDia (Coronary Artery Revascularization in Diabetes)
trial, 510 patients with diabetes and multivessel or complex singlevessel CAD were randomly assigned to either CABG or PCI, with
the use of either BMS or DES and routine use of abciximab. [156] There

were no differences between CABG and PCI for the primary endpoint of 1 year composite of death, MI, or stroke, but the trial was
underpowered to detect these differences. However, repeat revascularization was more likely to occur in patients treated with PCI
(P <0.001). [156]

In the subset of 452 patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD

who were enrolled in the SYNTAX trial, there were no differences

in the composite safety endpoint of all-cause death, stroke, and MI at
5 year follow-up. [155] However, the need for repeat revascularization
(HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.04–3.88, P <0.001) was significantly more frequent in patients with diabetes treated with PCI than in those who
underwent CABG. [155][,][275] Patients with diabetes had a higher rate of
repeat revascularization after PCI when compared with CABG in the
low (<_22) (38.5 vs. 18.5%, respectively, P = 0.014) and intermediate
(23 - 33) (27 vs. 13.4%, respectively, P = 0.049) SYNTAX score tertiles. Further analyses according to treatment with either oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin showed that the MACCE rate was
significantly greater after PCI in both the oral hypoglycaemic agent
group (PCI 40.4 vs. CABG 26.4%, P = 0.022) and the insulindependent group (PCI 56.2 vs. CABG 32.6%, P = 0.002). A higher
incidence of cardiac death was noted in the insulin-dependent
patients treated with PCI (PCI 18.8 vs. CABG 7.1%, P = 0.023).
In the SYNTAX trial, diabetes was not an independent predictor

of outcomes once the SYNTAX score was entered into the multivariable model. [127] Consequently, the SYNTAX 2 score does not
include diabetes as one of the eight variables that impacts on the preferential selection of revascularization modality. [127] Conflicting data
were seen in a patient-level pooled analysis of 6081 patients treated
with stents (75% newer generation DES), stratified according to diabetes status and SYNTAX score. [157] After Cox regression adjust
ment, SYNTAX score and diabetes were both associated with

MACE (P <0.001 and P = 0.0028, respectively). At 2 years, patients
with diabetes had higher MACE (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03–1.53, P =
0.026) and TVR, and similar death and MI rates. [157]

In the BEST trial, patients with diabetes treated with PCI had a
higher rate of the primary endpoint of death, MI, or TVR compared
with CABG (EES: n=177; CABG: n=186) (19.2 vs. 9.1%, P = 0.007)
(see section 5). [105]

9.2.2 Meta-analysis of coronary artery bypass grafting vs.
percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with

diabetes

A meta-analysis—restricted to four RCTs covering 3052 patientscompared PCI with the use of early-generation DES vs. CABG in
patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD. It suggested a higher risk
of death and MI with revascularization by early-generation DES (RR
1.51, 95% CI 1.09–2.10; P <0.01), but a lower risk of stroke (2.3 vs.
3.8%; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39– 0.90; P <0.01). [152] A sensitivity analysis
revealed that this superiority of CABG over early-generation DES for



high SYNTAX score. A network meta-analysis had suggested that the
survival benefit of CABG over PCI in patients with diabetes might be
lost when using EES, [151] though this was not confirmed in a subsequent meta-analysis that also included the direct comparison
between EES and CABG in the subset of BEST. [153]

In a collaborative, individual patient data pooled analysis of 11 518
patients with multivessel or LM disease randomized to CABG or PCI
with stents, all-cause death was significantly different after CABG
(9.2%) and PCI (11.2%) (P = 0.0038), which was evident in patients
with diabetes (10.7 vs. 15.7%, respectively; P = 0.0001) but not in
patients without diabetes (8.4 vs. 8.7%, respectively; P = 0.81)
(P interaction = 0.0077). [124] Similar results were found in the subgroup of
7040 patients with multivessel disease (P interaction = 0.0453), while the
interaction with diabetes was not significant in the 4478 patients with
LM disease (P interaction = 0.13).
A recent population-based analysis has confirmed the benefit of
CABG compared with PCI in patients with diabetes when patients
present with an ACS. [196] Consequently, overall current evidence continues to favour CABG as the revascularization modality of choice
for patients with diabetes and multivessel disease. When patients
present with a comorbidity that increases surgical risk, the choice of
revascularization method is best decided by multidisciplinary individu
alized risk assessment.

9.3 Revascularization with the use of
percutaneous coronary intervention
For the reasons discussed above, PCI in patients with diabetes is
often more complex than PCI in the absence of diabetes.
Nevertheless, irrespective of diabetic status, the same principles
apply as discussed in section 16. Placement of a new-generation DES
is the default strategy.

9.4 Antithrombotic pharmacotherapy
In the current context of the use of oral P2Y 12 -inhibitors, there is no

indication that antithrombotic pharmacotherapy should differ
between diabetics and patients without diabetes who are undergoing

revascularization. For detailed discussion refer to section 17.

9.5 Metformin

There is a theoretical risk of lactic acidosis and deteriorating renal
function in patients treated with metformin who are exposed to iodinated contrast media. [280] Consequently, it is generally recommended
that in elective cases, metformin should be withheld before angiography or PCI for 48 h, as the plasma half-life of metformin is 6.2 h, [280]

and reintroduced 48 h later. However, clinical experience suggests
that the actual risk of lactate acidosis is very small, and that checking
renal function after angiography in patients on metformin and withholding the drug when renal function deteriorates appears to be an
acceptable alternative. [280] In patients with renal failure, metformin
should be stopped before the procedure. Accurate recognition of
metformin-associated lactic acidosis based on arterial pH <7.35,
blood lactate >5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL), and detectable plasma metformin concentration should prompt the initiation of haemodialysis.


In the subset of 452 patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD

who were enrolled in the SYNTAX trial, there were no differences

in the composite safety endpoint of all-cause death, stroke, and MI at
5 year follow-up. [155] However, the need for repeat revascularization
(HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.04–3.88, P <0.001) was significantly more frequent in patients with diabetes treated with PCI than in those who
underwent CABG. [155][,][275] Patients with diabetes had a higher rate of
repeat revascularization after PCI when compared with CABG in the
low (<_22) (38.5 vs. 18.5%, respectively, P = 0.014) and intermediate
(23 - 33) (27 vs. 13.4%, respectively, P = 0.049) SYNTAX score tertiles. Further analyses according to treatment with either oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin showed that the MACCE rate was
significantly greater after PCI in both the oral hypoglycaemic agent
group (PCI 40.4 vs. CABG 26.4%, P = 0.022) and the insulindependent group (PCI 56.2 vs. CABG 32.6%, P = 0.002). A higher
incidence of cardiac death was noted in the insulin-dependent
patients treated with PCI (PCI 18.8 vs. CABG 7.1%, P = 0.023).
In the SYNTAX trial, diabetes was not an independent predictor

of outcomes once the SYNTAX score was entered into the multivariable model. [127] Consequently, the SYNTAX 2 score does not
include diabetes as one of the eight variables that impacts on the preferential selection of revascularization modality. [127] Conflicting data
were seen in a patient-level pooled analysis of 6081 patients treated
with stents (75% newer generation DES), stratified according to diabetes status and SYNTAX score. [157] After Cox regression adjust
ment, SYNTAX score and diabetes were both associated with

MACE (P <0.001 and P = 0.0028, respectively). At 2 years, patients
with diabetes had higher MACE (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03–1.53, P =
0.026) and TVR, and similar death and MI rates. [157]

In the BEST trial, patients with diabetes treated with PCI had a
higher rate of the primary endpoint of death, MI, or TVR compared
with CABG (EES: n=177; CABG: n=186) (19.2 vs. 9.1%, P = 0.007)
(see section 5). [105]


9.2.2 Meta-analysis of coronary artery bypass grafting vs.
percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with

diabetes

A meta-analysis—restricted to four RCTs covering 3052 patientscompared PCI with the use of early-generation DES vs. CABG in
patients with diabetes and multivessel CAD. It suggested a higher risk
of death and MI with revascularization by early-generation DES (RR
1.51, 95% CI 1.09–2.10; P <0.01), but a lower risk of stroke (2.3 vs.
3.8%; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39– 0.90; P <0.01). [152] A sensitivity analysis
revealed that this superiority of CABG over early-generation DES for
the endpoint MACCE was most pronounced among patients with a

10.3 Gaps in the evidence
Thus far, patients with CKD have been excluded from randomized
trials on myocardial revascularization, hence current data are based
on observational studies only. A randomized trial on optimal longterm revascularization strategies in patients with moderate-to-severe
stress-induced ischaemia and severe CKD is currently ongoing
[(ISCHEMIA-CKD, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01985360).](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/)
Moreover, additional randomized evidence on optimal strategies for
CIN prevention is needed.

9.6 Gaps in the evidence
Following successful revascularization, the rate of events during
follow-up remains high in patients with diabetes, independent of the

mode of revascularization. Future research should be focused on

identifying new disease-modifying therapies to influence the progression of vascular disease in this high-risk cohort.
### 10 Revascularization in patients with chronic kidney disease

10.1 Evidence base for revascularization

and recommendations

Myocardial revascularization in patients with chronic kidney disease
(CKD), specifically National Kidney Foundation stage 3 or higher, is
addressed by the 2014 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization. After reviewing the subsequent literature, the current
Task Force has not found any evidence to support a major update. A
recent post hoc analysis of the SYNTAX trial on patients with CKD
confirms the principles for allocating patients to PCI or CABG, [281] as

discussed in section 5 of this document.

10.2 Prevention of contrast-induced
nephropathy
The risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) depends on patientrelated factors, such as CKD, diabetes mellitus, congestive HF, haemodynamic instability, reduced plasma volume, female sex, advanced
age, anaemia, and periprocedural bleeding, as well as on the type and
volume of contrast administered. [282][–][288] When the ratio of total con
trast volume (in mL) to glomerular filtration rate (in mL/min) exceeds
3.7, the risk of CIN increases significantly. [287][,][288]

Adequate hydration remains the mainstay of CIN prevention. [289][–][294] High-dose statins, as indicated for secondary prevention irrespective of the risk of CIN are also beneficial. [293] All other
strategies for the prevention of CIN do not have sufficient evidence
to justify a recommendation in favour or against. [293][,][294] For more

11.2 Primary indication for myocardial
revascularization

11.2.1 Aortic valve disease

The recommendations for patients undergoing CABG for the clinically leading problem of CAD, who also have coexisting severe aortic
stenosis or regurgitation, remain unchanged from those of the 2014
Guidelines and support replacement of the aortic valve. [305] However,
in the current era of rapid developments in transcatheter valve
implantation technologies, a decision regarding replacement of the
aortic valve for moderate stenosis/regurgitation should be carefully
considered on a case-by-case basis in discussion with the Heart
Team. The patient’s age, type of prosthesis, pathogenesis of aortic
stenosis/regurgitation, aortic annular size, predicted size of implanted
valve, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) access routes,
and technical feasibility of a TAVI procedure in the future in case of
disease progression should all be taken into account. [306]

11.2.2 Mitral valve disease

Patients with concomitant severe primary mitral regurgitation (MR)
should undergo mitral valve repair at the time of CABG in keeping
with guidance for the surgical repair of primary MR. [305] There is also
consensus based on expert opinion on the surgical repair of severe
secondary MR at the time of CABG. [305][,][307] However, considerable
controversy exists about the treatment of moderate secondary or
ischaemic MR in patients undergoing CABG. Until the publication of
2 year outcomes of the CTSN (Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials
Network) randomized trial on treatment of ‘moderate’ ischaemic
MR, the literature in this field was limited to small single-centre

randomized trials, observational studies, and case series, and failed to

provide clear direction. The CTSN trial showed that addition of surgical mitral valve repair to CABG made no significant difference to

survival, overall reduction of adverse events, or LV reverse remodelling at 2 years. [308][,][309] Increased length of intensive care and hospital
stay and perioperative morbidity, including neurological complications and supraventricular arrhythmias, were reported in the CTSN
and other randomized trials in this group of patients. [308][–][310] Because
the CTSN trial used a very broad definition of moderate MR, including an effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) <_0.2 cm [2] plus additional criteria, no firm conclusions can be drawn concerning patients
with an EROA >0.2 cm [2] . Observational data suggest that in secondary MR, an EROA >0.2 cm [2] and regurgitant volume >30 mL indicates greater risk of cardiovascular events. [311][,][312] In the absence of
dedicated trials in this setting, the decision to combine mitral valve
surgery with CABG in patients with an EROA >0.2 cm [2] and regurgitant volume >30 mL needs to be made on a case-by-case basis by the
Heart Team. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, please refer
[to the Supplementary Data.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)

11.3 Gaps in the evidence
In patients with concomitant valvular and coronary disease, the possibility of future transcatheter therapy for the aortic and mitral valves
has made a significant impact on decision-making for patients with
predominantly coronary disease with moderate valve lesions.
However, there is currently little evidence on this topic. The need

### 11 Revascularization in patients requiring valve interventions

11.1 Primary indication for valve
interventions

Myocardial revascularization in patients undergoing primary valve
interventions, either by surgery or transcatheter routes, is addressed
by the 2014 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization.
After reviewing the subsequent literature, the current Task Force

endorses the recommendations of the 2014 Guidelines and has not

found any evidence to support a major update. These recommenda
tions are included below for ease of reference. Of note, the available

evidence on invasive functional assessment of CAD (with FFR or
iwFR) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) is limited to a few
small-scale observational studies. These studies support the feasibility
of FFR and iwFR in this setting. [302][–][304] Notwithstanding, the available
evidence is insufficient to support the use of invasive functional
assessment of coronary lesions in patients with AS, particularly in
consideration of the altered haemodynamic condition related to the
presence of AS. Therefore, the Task Force is in consensus that indications for myocardial revascularization based on angiographic assess
ment of CAD should be maintained, consistent with the 2014 ESC/

EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization and the 2017
ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart
disease. [305]



ESC/EACTS Guidelines 123


for and timing of PCI in patients undergoing TAVI is also an area with
limited evidence. The long-term outcomes of patients with concomitant surgical repair of ischaemic MR are also awaited.

### 12 Associated peripheral artery diseases

12.1 Prevention of stroke associated with
carotid artery disease and myocardial
revascularization

The early risk of stroke after myocardial revascularization is higher
after CABG than after PCI. [313] After 30 days, stroke rates between
revascularization techniques were similar in a recent individual
patient data meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials. [313]

Ischaemic stroke after CABG is multifactorial: thrombo-embolism

from the aorta, its branches, or the heart; atrial arrhythmias; inflammatory pro-thrombogenic milieu; lower levels of antiplatelet therapy
perioperatively; and haemodynamic instability. However, the most
consistent predictor of perioperative stroke is previous stroke or
TIA. There is no strong evidence that carotid artery stenosis is a significant cause of perioperative stroke except for bilateral severe carotid bifurcation stenosis. [314] Therefore, indications for preoperative
carotid bifurcation screening by duplex ultrasound are limited. [315]

Also, there is no evidence that prophylactic revascularization of unilateral asymptomatic carotid stenoses in CABG candidates reduces
the risk of perioperative stroke. It may be reasonable to restrict prophylactic carotid revascularization to patients at highest risk of postoperative stroke, i.e. patients with severe bilateral lesions or a history
of prior stroke/TIA. [316] Hence, the indication for revascularization,
and the choice between carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery
stenting in these patients, should be made by a multidisciplinary team
including a neurologist.
The 2017 Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral
arterial diseases in collaboration with the European Society of
Vascular Surgery cover the screening for and management of carotid
artery disease in patients scheduled for CABG, including screening,
indications, and the timing and type of carotid revascularization. [317] Its
recommendations are reproduced here.
Particularly for patients at high risk for perioperative stroke after
CABG, such as elderly patients or patients with previous TIA/stroke,
specific preventive measures have been suggested. CT scan screening
of the ascending aorta/arch atheroma has been proposed to better
assess risk stratification and guide the surgical strategy in elderly
patients. [318] It is recommended that acetylsalicylic acid is restarted 6
h, or at the latest 24 h, after surgery, and that clopidogrel or ticagrelor
are added in patients with ACS. New-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) is

associated with a risk of stroke that increased two-to-three times

after CABG. Its management is discussed in section 14.

12.2 Associated coronary and peripheral
artery diseases
Of all patients with CAD, 7–16% have lower extremity artery disease
(LEAD), which is associated with a worse prognosis, even if it remains
frequently asymptomatic, masked by cardiac symptoms. On the
other hand, in patients with LEAD, CAD is present in up to 70% of
patients. [317] The choice between CABG and PCI is controversial and,
in the absence of solid data, it should follow a multidisciplinary

should be preserved or harvested guided by the results of clinical
examination including the ankle-brachial index. In addition, inter-arm
blood pressure asymmetry should lead to the investigation of subclavian artery stenosis. Further details are provided in the 2017 peripheral arterial diseases Guidelines. [317]

### 13 Repeat revascularization

13.1 Early graft failure
Early graft failure after CABG is reported in up to 12% of grafts, as
evaluated by intraoperative angiography. [323] However, only a minority
(around 3%) are clinically apparent. Graft failure can be due to conduit defects, anastomotic technical errors, poor native vessel run-off,
or competitive flow with the native vessel. When clinically relevant,
acute graft failure may result in MI with consequently increased mortality and major cardiac events. The suspicion of early graft failure
should arise in the presence of ECG signs of ischaemia, ventricular
arrhythmias, biomarker changes, new wall motion abnormalities, or
haemodynamic instability. [324][,][325] Owing to the low specificity of ECG
changes and echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities during the
post-operative course, and the delay in the appearance of biomarker
changes, a careful assessment of all variables will influence decisionmaking for angiographic evaluation.
Perioperative angiography is recommended in cases of suspected
severe myocardial ischaemia to detect its cause and aid decisionmaking on the most appropriate treatment. [323][,][325][,][326] In symptomatic
patients, early post-operative graft failure can be identified as the
cause of ischaemia in 40 - 80% of cases. [324][,][326][–][328] The optimal treatment strategy in patients with acute graft failure should be decided by
ad hoc consultation between the cardiovascular surgeon and the
interventional cardiologist, on the basis of the patient’s clinical condition and the extent of myocardium at risk. In the case of early postoperative graft failure, emergency ad hoc PCI may limit the extent of
infarction, if technically feasible. The target for PCI is the native vessel
or the internal mammary artery (IMA) graft, while the acutely

ESC/EACTS Guidelines 125


occluded saphenous vein graft (SVG) and any anastomotic site should
be avoided, if possible, due to concerns regarding embolization or
perforation. Redo surgery should be favoured if the anatomy is
unsuitable for PCI, if several important grafts are occluded, or in the
case of clear anastomotic errors. In asymptomatic patients, repeat
revascularization should be considered if the artery is of an appropriate size and supplies a large territory of myocardium.
Further details on the diagnosis and management of perioperative
MI are provided in a recent ESC position paper. [329]

13.2 Acute percutaneous coronary
intervention failure

The need for urgent surgery to manage PCI-related complications is
uncommon (<1%) and only required in patients with major complications that cannot be adequately resolved by percutaneous techniques. [330][,][331] The need for emergency CABG is mainly confined to
patients with a large, evolving MI due to iatrogenic vessel occlusion
that cannot be salvaged percutaneously, or in patients with recurrent
cardiac tamponade after pericardiocentesis following PCI-related
vessel rupture. [330][,][332][,][333]

13.3 Disease progression and late graft
failure

Ischaemia after CABG may be due to the progression of disease in
native vessels or de novo disease of bypass grafts. [334] Repeat revascularization in these patients is indicated in the presence of significant
symptoms despite medical treatment, and in asymptomatic patients
with objective evidence of large myocardial ischaemia (>10% of the
LV). [32][,][87]

13.3.1 Redo coronary artery bypass grafting or
percutaneous coronary intervention
PCI in patients with prior CABG has worse acute and long-term outcomes than in patients without prior CABG. [335][,][336] Likewise, redo
CABG has a two- to four-fold increased mortality compared with
first-time CABG, and repeat CABG is generally performed
infrequently. [334][,][337][–][339] There are limited data comparing the efficacy
of PCI vs. redo CABG in patients with previous CABG. The proportion of patients undergoing PCI, redo CABG, or conservative treatment differs significantly between studies; in one study, PCI was
favoured in �50% of patients with only 22% undergoing redo CABG,
while another study favoured CABG in 67% of patients. [340][,][341] In the
AWESOME (Angina With Extremely Serious Operative Mortality
Evaluation) RCT and registry, overall 3 year mortality was comparable between redo CABG and PCI. [341][,][342] A more recent study also
found comparable rates of death and MI between redo CABG and
PCI, although there were significantly more repeat revascularizations
with PCI. [341][,][343]

In view of the higher risk of procedural mortality with redo CABG
and the similar long-term outcome, PCI is the preferred revascularization strategy in patients with amenable anatomy. [340] PCI via the
bypassed native artery should be the preferred approach. If PCI in
the native vessel fails or is not an option, PCI in the diseased SVG
should be considered. CABG should be considered for patients with
extensively diseased or occluded bypass grafts and diffuse native ves


The IMA is the conduit of choice for revascularization during redo
CABG if not previously used, or can be salvaged and reused in specific cases. [344][,][345]

13.3.2 Percutaneous coronary intervention for saphenous
vein graft lesions
PCI in SVGs is associated with an increased risk of distal coronary
embolization, frequently resulting in periprocedural MI. [346] PCI of de
novo SVG stenosis is considered a high-risk intervention because SVG
atheroma is friable and more prone to distal embolization. Several
different approaches have been evaluated to prevent the distal embolization of particulate debris, including distal occlusion/aspiration,
proximal occlusion, suction, filter devices, or covered stents. Distal
protection devices using filters have shown the most encouraging
results. However, although a single randomized trial supports the use
of distal embolic protection during SVG PCI, observational studies
including data from large-scale registries are conflicting. [347][–][349]

Outcomes from studies with other devices used for SVG PCI are not
sufficient to recommend its use. [350][–][353]

Based on data from a small number of randomized trials, implantation of DES in SVG lesions is associated with a lower risk of repeat
revascularization than with BMS at 1 year follow-up. [354][–][356] In the
only trial powered for a clinical endpoint—the ISAR-CABG (Is DrugEluting-Stenting Associated with Improved Results in Coronary
Artery Bypass Grafts) trial [354] —the primary endpoint of death, MI,
and target lesion revascularization was significantly reduced with DES
vs. BMS. However, at 5 year follow-up, the advantage of DES over
BMS was lost due to a higher incidence of target lesion revascularization between years 1 and 5 in patients treated with DES. [357] Longerterm follow-up of the two smaller trials is available; one suggested
sustained superiority of DES over BMS, while the other suggested
loss of the efficacy advantage of the DES. [358][,][359]

13.4 Repeat percutaneous coronary
intervention

Recurrence of symptoms or ischaemia after PCI is the result of restenosis, incomplete initial revascularization, or disease progression. [334]

Patients may require repeat PCI due to late and very late stent

thrombosis.

13.4.1 Restenosis

Restenosis associated with angina or ischaemia should be treated by
repeat revascularization, and repeat PCI remains the strategy of
choice for most of these patients. In this setting, the results from DES
are superior to those obtained with balloon angioplasty, BMS implantation, or brachytherapy. [360][–][364]

For restenosis within BMS, drug-coated balloon (DCB) proved
superior to plain balloon angioplasty [365][–][367] and comparable to firstgeneration DES. [365][,][366][,][368][–][372] One trial showed inferior angiographic
outcomes in comparison to new-generation DES, [373] while a second
trial showed comparable outcomes. [374] For restenosis within DES,
DCBs also proved superior to plain balloon angioplasty [367][,][369][,][371] and
comparable to first-generation DES. [371] In one study, DCBs were inferior to new-generation DES in terms of the primary angiographic outcome measure. [375] In a more recent study, including patients with any
type of in-stent restenosis, outcomes between DCB and repeat


13.2 Acute percutaneous coronary
intervention failure

The need for urgent surgery to manage PCI-related complications is
uncommon (<1%) and only required in patients with major complications that cannot be adequately resolved by percutaneous techniques. [330][,][331] The need for emergency CABG is mainly confined to
patients with a large, evolving MI due to iatrogenic vessel occlusion
that cannot be salvaged percutaneously, or in patients with recurrent
cardiac tamponade after pericardiocentesis following PCI-related
vessel rupture. [330][,][332][,][333]


13.3 Disease progression and late graft
failure

Ischaemia after CABG may be due to the progression of disease in
native vessels or de novo disease of bypass grafts. [334] Repeat revascularization in these patients is indicated in the presence of significant
symptoms despite medical treatment, and in asymptomatic patients
with objective evidence of large myocardial ischaemia (>10% of the
LV). [32][,][87]


13.3.1 Redo coronary artery bypass grafting or
percutaneous coronary intervention
PCI in patients with prior CABG has worse acute and long-term outcomes than in patients without prior CABG. [335][,][336] Likewise, redo
CABG has a two- to four-fold increased mortality compared with
first-time CABG, and repeat CABG is generally performed
infrequently. [334][,][337][–][339] There are limited data comparing the efficacy
of PCI vs. redo CABG in patients with previous CABG. The proportion of patients undergoing PCI, redo CABG, or conservative treatment differs significantly between studies; in one study, PCI was
favoured in �50% of patients with only 22% undergoing redo CABG,
while another study favoured CABG in 67% of patients. [340][,][341] In the
AWESOME (Angina With Extremely Serious Operative Mortality
Evaluation) RCT and registry, overall 3 year mortality was comparable between redo CABG and PCI. [341][,][342] A more recent study also
found comparable rates of death and MI between redo CABG and
PCI, although there were significantly more repeat revascularizations
with PCI. [341][,][343]

In view of the higher risk of procedural mortality with redo CABG
and the similar long-term outcome, PCI is the preferred revascularization strategy in patients with amenable anatomy. [340] PCI via the
bypassed native artery should be the preferred approach. If PCI in
the native vessel fails or is not an option, PCI in the diseased SVG
should be considered. CABG should be considered for patients with
extensively diseased or occluded bypass grafts and diffuse native vessel disease, especially in the absence of patent arterial grafts. [340]

126 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


stenting with new-generation DES were comparable. [376] A single
randomized trial of patients undergoing DCB for restenosis within
DES showed superior angiographic outcomes in patients who underwent lesion preparation with scoring balloons vs. standard angioplasty balloons. [377]

Network meta-analysis suggests that repeat stenting with newgeneration DES (with EES) and DCB are ranked first and second as
the highest efficacy treatments. [378][,][379] The superior angiographic antirestenotic efficacy of new-generation DES should be weighed against
a possible excess of long-term adverse events with repeat stenting
during longer-term follow-up of these trials. [380][,][381] However, observations in relation to clinical events must be interpreted with caution,
as none of the trials was powered for clinical endpoints and the comparator stent in studies with long-term follow-up was an earlygeneration DES.
The use of intracoronary imaging provides unique insights into the
underlying mechanisms of in-stent restenosis (see section 16.2).
OCT is able to detect the presence of neoatherosclerosis in a significant number of these patients. Underexpanded stents should be
aggressively tackled with high-pressure dilatations using noncompliant balloons. The optimization of the final results remains crucial during reinterventions for in-stent restenosis and, in this regard,
the use of intracoronary imaging may be particularly helpful.
Outcomes of patients with in-stent restenosis after DES are poorer
than those in patients with BMS in-stent restenosis, independently of
the therapeutic modality. [382] In patients with recurrent episodes of


associated multivessel disease, especially in the presence of other
complex lesions such as chronic total occlusions—CABG should be
considered before a new PCI attempt.

13.4.2 Disease progression
Patients with symptomatic disease progression after PCI account for
up to 50% of reinterventions. [383][,][384] They should be managed using
criteria similar to those applied to patients without previous

revascularization.

13.4.3 Stent thrombosis

Although stent thrombosis is very rare, particularly since the advent of
new-generation DES, it may have devastating clinical consequences.
Stent thrombosis usually presents as a large MI and patients should be
treated according to the principles outlined in section 8. [385] Aggressive,
high-pressure balloon dilation should be used to correct underlying,
stent-related, predisposing mechanical problems. [386][,][387] Liberal use of
intracoronary imaging in order to detect and modify underlying
mechanical factors is recommended (Figure 7) (see section 16.2).
Although repeat stenting in patients with stent thrombosis may be
avoided when satisfactory results are obtained with balloon dilation,
a new stent may be required to overcome edge-related dissections
and adjacent lesions, or to optimize final results. [388]

There is no evidence that the post-interventional management of
patients with stent thrombosis should differ from that of patients
with thrombosis of a de novo lesion resulting in STEMI.

### 14 Arrhythmias

14.1 Ventricular arrhythmias
14.1.1 Revascularization for the prevention of sudden
cardiac death in patients with stable coronary artery

disease and reduced left ventricular function

Revascularization plays an important role in reducing the frequency
of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with normal or mildly reduced
LV function, [389][,][390] as well as the risk of sudden cardiac death in



patients with CAD and LVEF <_35%. [391] Indirect evidence for a pro
tective effect of revascularization was demonstrated in the MADIT II

(Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial II) and SCDHEFT studies (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial), where
the efficacy of implantation cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) was
reduced if revascularization was performed prior to implantation. [392][,][393] CABG in patients with reduced EF reduces cardiac and
overall mortality for a follow-up of 10 years. [78][,][81] In view of the protective effect of revascularization on ventricular arrhythmias, patients

128 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


with ischaemic LV dysfunction (LVEF <_35%) who are considered for
primary preventive ICD implantation should be evaluated for ischaemia and/or for potential revascularization targets.

14.1.2 Revascularization for the treatment of electrical

storm

Electrical storm is a life-threatening syndrome related to incessant
ventricular arrhythmias, which is most frequently observed in
patients with ischaemic heart disease, advanced systolic HF, valve disease, corrected congenital heart disease, and genetic disorders such
as Brugada syndrome, early repolarization, and long QT syndrome. [394] Urgent coronary angiography and revascularization should
be part of the management of patients with electrical storm, as well
as antiarrhythmic drug therapy and/or ablation of ventricular
tachycardia.

14.1.3 Revascularization after out-of-hospital cardiac

arrest

Approximately 70% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
have CAD, with acute vessel occlusion observed in 50%. [395] Multiple
non-randomized studies suggest that emergency coronary angiography and, if appropriate, PCI after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest yield a
favourable survival rate of <_60% at 1 year, which is considerably
higher than the 25% overall survival rate in patients with aborted cardiac arrest. [396][,][397] More recent data suggest that almost one-quarter
of patients, resuscitated from cardiac arrest but without ST-segment
elevation, show a culprit lesion (either vessel occlusion or irregular
lesion). [398][–][401] Recent large-scale observational studies have shown
an impact on mortality of early angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. [402][,][403] Thus, in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,
early coronary angiography and PCI, if appropriate, should be performed irrespective of the ECG pattern if no obvious non-cardiac
cause of the arrhythmia is present. [404]

14.2 Atrial arrhythmias
The management of AF in patients with ischaemic heart disease is
addressed by the 2016 ESC Guidelines for the management of AF
developed in collaboration with EACTS. [405] After reviewing the subsequent literature, the current Task Force endorses the recommendations of the 2016 Guidelines and has not identified a need for any
major update. Accordingly, the recommendation tables are taken

from the 2016 Guidelines. For a detailed discussion, we refer to the
previous Guidelines. [405]

14.2.1 Atrial fibrillation complicating percutaneous
coronary intervention
New-onset AF in patients undergoing PCI occurs in 2–6% of procedures and increases with age, pre-existing HF, AMI, and arterial
hypertension. [406][–][409] Notably, new-onset AF [defined as change from
sinus rhythm (SR) at admission to AF during/after PCI] typically



impaired prognosis and a more than doubling of the risk of death,
congestive HF, and stroke. [403]

The use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) for stroke prevention in
patients with AF occurring during or after PCI should follow the ESC

Guidelines on Atrial Fibrillation for antithrombotic treatment of AF
that occurs outside the setting of PCI, [405] although prospective studies are scarce. The combination and duration of anticoagulation and
antiplatelet therapy should be assessed according to the clinical situa
tion, as outlined in section 17 as well as in the ESC Guidelines on
Atrial Fibrillation [405] and the ESC Focused Update on Dual
Antiplatelet Therapy. [410]

14.2.2 Atrial fibrillation complicating coronary artery
bypass grafting
Post-operative AF affects one-third of patients undergoing cardiac
surgery. [411][–][414] The main risk factor for post-operative AF is age, and

it is associated with an increased immediate risk of stroke, increased
morbidity, and 30 day mortality. [415][–][417] In the long-term, patients
with an episode of post-operative AF have a two-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality, and a substantially increased risk of future AF
and ischaemic stroke compared with patients who remain in SR after
surgery. [416][,][418][–][422]

Post-operative AF is a common complication, in which prophylactic treatment has a moderate effect. Pre-operative anti-arrhythmic
drug treatment may be initiated but will have to be weighed against
side effects. Beta-blockers decrease the incidence of post-operative
AF after CABG. [412][,][423][–][429]

14.2.3 Post-operative atrial fibrillation and stroke risk
Patients with post-operative AF have an increased stroke risk postoperatively as well as during follow-up, [419][,][430] and warfarin medication
at discharge has been associated with a reduced long-term mortality. [431] To date, there are no studies indicating that post-operative AF
is less harmful than any other form of AF, and good quality data are
needed. Anticoagulation treatment with warfarin or non-vitamin K
antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for stroke prevention in
patients with post-operative AF should therefore follow the guidelines for the antithrombotic treatment of AF occurring outside the
setting of CABG using the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [Cardiac failure,
Hypertension, Age >_75 (Doubled), Diabetes, Stroke (Doubled) –
Vascular disease, Age 65–74 and Sex category (Female)] score. The
duration and timing of OAC in post-operative AF patients should be
assessed individually.
Whether or not surgical left atrial appendage (LAA) obliteration
reduces stroke risk has been studied in smaller trials and registry
studies with conflicting results, [432][–][434] and is currently under investigation in a large randomized trial. [435] Removal or closure of the LAA
should be considered as an adjunct to anticoagulation and not as an

alternative until more data are available.


14.1.2 Revascularization for the treatment of electrical

storm

Electrical storm is a life-threatening syndrome related to incessant
ventricular arrhythmias, which is most frequently observed in
patients with ischaemic heart disease, advanced systolic HF, valve disease, corrected congenital heart disease, and genetic disorders such
as Brugada syndrome, early repolarization, and long QT syndrome. [394] Urgent coronary angiography and revascularization should
be part of the management of patients with electrical storm, as well
as antiarrhythmic drug therapy and/or ablation of ventricular
tachycardia.


14.1.3 Revascularization after out-of-hospital cardiac

arrest

Approximately 70% of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest
have CAD, with acute vessel occlusion observed in 50%. [395] Multiple
non-randomized studies suggest that emergency coronary angiography and, if appropriate, PCI after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest yield a
favourable survival rate of <_60% at 1 year, which is considerably
higher than the 25% overall survival rate in patients with aborted cardiac arrest. [396][,][397] More recent data suggest that almost one-quarter
of patients, resuscitated from cardiac arrest but without ST-segment
elevation, show a culprit lesion (either vessel occlusion or irregular
lesion). [398][–][401] Recent large-scale observational studies have shown
an impact on mortality of early angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. [402][,][403] Thus, in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,
early coronary angiography and PCI, if appropriate, should be performed irrespective of the ECG pattern if no obvious non-cardiac
cause of the arrhythmia is present. [404]

occurs during the first 4 days after AMI, and is associated with

been studied sufficiently. Likewise, the role of routine left atrial exclusion at surgery for the prevention of stroke is currently unclear.
### 15 Procedural aspects of coronary artery bypass grafting

CABG remains the most common cardiac surgical procedure, and



Perioperative medication and blood management are covered in separate Guidelines. [410][,][444]

15.1 Surgical techniques
15.1.1 Completeness of revascularization
Current surgical practice is largely based on an anatomical definition
of complete revascularization, and aims to bypass all epicardial vessels
with a diameter exceeding >_1.5 mm and a luminal reduction of >_50%
in at least one angiographic view. [131] Depending on the definition of
completeness of revascularization, the outcome after CABG in
patients with incomplete revascularization was either similar [445][–][449]

or inferior [131][,][132][,][449][–][451] to that of patients with complete

the techniques have been refined during 50 years of evolution. [443]

130 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


revascularization. Certainly, in some patients with a stenosis in small
vessels with little myocardium at risk, complete revascularization may
not be necessary.
FFR-guided surgical revascularization has been associated with
improved graft patency, but more studies are needed to investigate
whether it improves clinical outcomes. [28][,][452] Further discussion of
FFR-guided revascularization is provided in sections 3.2.1.1 and

5.3.1.3.

15.1.2 Conduit selection

In addition to patient-related factors, the outcome following CABG
is related to the long-term patency of grafts and therefore is maximized with the use of arterial grafts, specifically the IMA. [453][,][454]

Except in rare circumstances, all patients should receive at least one
arterial graft—the left IMA (LIMA)— preferentially to the LAD. [453][,][455]

SVG patency rates for non-LAD targets have been reported to be
suboptimal. [456] Bilateral IMA (BIMA) and radial artery for non-LAD
targets have been shown to provide better patency rates than SVG,
particularly for the left coronary artery system. [457] Therefore, a second arterial graft should be considered depending on the patient’s life
expectancy, risk factors for sternal wound complications, coronary
anatomy, degree of target vessel stenosis, graft quality, and surgical

expertise.
Whether or not the use of additional arterial grafts can translate
into prolonged survival remains debatable. Data from nonrandomized studies suggest that the use of BIMA over single IMA
(SIMA) use is associated with improved long-term survival, as well as
fewer non-fatal events such as MI, recurrent angina, and the need for
re-operation. [458][–][465] However, observational studies are subject to
selection bias, despite propensity matching, and the effect of prolonged survival with additional arterial grafts has not been confirmed
in randomized trials. [466]

The ART trial (Arterial Revascularization Trial) has been designed
to answer the question of whether BIMA can improve 10 year survival when compared with SIMA. Interim analysis showed no difference at 5 years in the rate of death or the composite of death, MI, or
stroke, and 10 year results are warranted to draw final conclusions. [467] Limitations of the ART trial include a high crossover rate
from the BIMA arm to the SIMA arm and a high rate of radial artery
use in the SIMA arm that may have diluted the benefit of
BIMA. [468][–][470] The use of BIMA grafting is associated with an increase

in sternal dehiscence, and an increased rate of mediastinitis in obese
patients and patients with diabetes. [458][,][464][,][471][–][475] In the ART trial, the

use of BIMA was associated with a 1.0 - 1.5% absolute risk increase in



grafting should be considered in patients with a reasonable life
expectancy and a low risk of sternal wound complications.
The radial artery constitutes an alternative as the second arterial
graft in patients in whom BIMA grafting is not feasible, patients with a
high risk of sternal wound complications, or as a third arterial graft.
There is a strong, adverse influence on radial artery patency when
the native coronary artery stenosis is <70%, and therefore its use
should be limited to coronary artery stenosis >70% and ideally
>90%. [477] Use of the radial artery as the second conduit of choice has
been linked to improved survival in registry studies. [478][–][480] Available
RCTs testing the radial artery vs. saphenous vein graft used angiographic patency as the primary endpoint, and none was powered to
detect differences in clinical outcomes. [481] A recently published
patient-level meta-analysis pooling six RCTs comparing radial artery
vs. saphenous vein graft showed that the use of the radial artery was
associated with a lower rate of the primary endpoint (composite of
death, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization) at mean
follow-up of 50 months, mainly driven by a significantly strong reduc
tion of need for reintervention and a more modest reduction in subsequent MI. [482] Despite a significantly lower risk of occlusion at
follow-up angiography, no difference in all-cause mortality was found.

15.1.3 Mammary artery harvesting
While the skeletonized technique of harvesting the IMA has a higher
theoretical potential for injury, the potential benefits include a longer
conduit, more versatility (sequential anastomosis), higher blood flow,
and fewer wound-healing problems. [471][,][483][–][488] Therefore, in patients
at higher risk of sternal wound complications, skeletonization is

recommended.

15.1.4 Radial artery harvesting
Radial artery harvesting is associated with negligible morbidity if preceded by assessment of the hand’s collateral circulation. Endoscopic
radial harvesting is possible, but robust evidence concerning its safety
and efficacy is scarce. [489][,][490] Use of the radial artery after recent coronary angiography with radial access should be discouraged due to
potential endothelial damage. [491] Harvesting of the whole radial artery
pedicle, together with the intraluminal and subadventitial injection of
vasodilators, are useful steps to prevent spasm.

15.1.5 Saphenous vein harvesting
Saphenous vein harvesting can be accomplished using open and minimally invasive techniques, which include interrupted incisions and
partial or full endoscopic procedures. Endoscopic vein graft harvesting leads to a reduced rate of leg wound complications, [492][–][495] but
the short- and long-term patency of endoscopically harvested vein
grafts, compared with openly harvested grafts, has been
challenged. [456][,][496][–][498] Although there is no unequivocal evidence

ESC/EACTS Guidelines 131


concerning patency rates, most data from meta-analyses and

randomized and non-randomized trials do not demonstrate inferior
clinical outcomes with endoscopic vein harvest. [492][,][493][,][499][,][500] If an
endoscopic vein graft harvest is performed, it should be undertaken
by experienced surgeons or physician assistants with appropriate
training and reasonable caseloads. [501][–][503] If an open technique is used,
the ‘no-touch’ technique has shown superior patency rates in multiple randomized trials, [504][–][507] with a patency rate >80% after 16
years. [507]

15.1.6 Cross-Clamping
A single cross-clamp technique may be preferred to multiple manipulations of the aorta, with the aim of reducing atheroembolic events,
but a strict no-touch technique most effectively reduces embolization
of atherosclerotic material. [508][–][510] In cases of off-pump surgery, devices that allow a clampless procedure may help reduce the incidence
of cerebral vascular complications. [511][,][512]

15.1.7 Intraoperative quality control
Besides continuous ECG monitoring and transoesophageal echocardiography immediately after revascularization, intraoperative quality
control may also include graft flow measurement to confirm or
exclude a technical graft problem. [513] Transit-time flow measurement
is the most frequently used technique for graft assessment and has
been able to detect 2 - 4% of grafts that require revision. [513][,][514]

In observational studies, the use of intraoperative graft assessment
has been shown to reduce the rate of adverse events and graft failure,
although interpretation can be challenging in sequential and T-graft
configurations. [513][,][515][–][517]

15.1.8 On-pump and off-pump procedures
Two large, international randomized trials have shown no difference
in 30 day or 1 year clinical outcomes between on- and off-pump surgery when performed by experienced surgeons. [518][–][520] There is also
evidence to conclude that, for most patients and surgeons, on-pump
surgery provides excellent short- and long-term outcomes. [518][,][520][–][523]

For some surgeons, off-pump surgery is associated with inferior early
and late graft patency rates, and possibly compromised long-term
survival; however, aortic no-touch/clampless off-pump procedures in
the hands of highly trained teams appear to be associated with a
reduced risk of early morbidity, such as stroke, and fewer transfusions. [508][–][510][,][524][–][528] In the subgroup of patients with end-stage
CKD, there is some evidence that off-pump surgery is associated
with lower in-hospital mortality and less need for new renal replacement therapy. [529]



15.1.9 Minimally invasive and hybrid procedures
Minimally invasive coronary surgery with LIMA, harvested either
directly or under video-assisted vision, may represent an attractive
alternative to a sternotomy. [530] It has a similar safety and efficacy profile to conventional on-pump and off-pump procedures, with a markedly reduced post-operative length of stay and an early quality of life
benefit, although spreading of the ribs is associated with increased
post-operative pain. [531][–][533] It has been shown to be safe and effective
in the treatment of proximal LAD stenosis or chronically occluded
LAD arteries. [144] Moreover, when compared with PCI in a setting of
single-vessel proximal LAD disease, minimally invasive coronary surgery was associated with less need for coronary reintervention. [143][,][534][,][535] When combined with PCI to non-LAD vessels, it

provides the opportunity for hybrid coronary revascularization to be
performed in selected patients with multivessel disease. [536]

Hybrid revascularization can be performed consecutively in a
hybrid operating room, or sequentially on separate occasions in the
conventional surgical and PCI environments. [537][–][540] In a small
randomized trial of 200 patients, 1 year and 5 year rates of death, MI,
stroke, and major bleeding or repeat revascularization were not significantly different between hybrid revascularization and
CABG. [536][,][541] Heart Team discussion and the prospective planning of
a joint strategy are critical for the success of a hybrid revascularization
strategy. [542]

15.2 Reporting perioperative outcomes
Perioperative reporting of outcomes after CABG procedures should
be done on a risk-adjusted basis. The early risk period after CABG
extends up to 3 months, is multifactorial, and depends on the interface between technical variability and patient comorbidity. [543]

15.3 Gaps in the evidence
The role of FFR and iwFR in guiding surgical revascularization needs
further investigation into whether it improves clinical outcomes.
Likewise, there are insufficient data on the impact of intraoperative
assessment of graft flow on outcomes.
In view of the limitations of observational studies comparing BIMA

with SIMA and the limitations of the ART trial, the ROMA

(Randomization of Single vs. Multiple Arterial Grafts) trial is recruiting
to answer the question of whether the use of additional arterial conduits (either BIMA or radial artery) translates into superior clinical
outcomes when compared with SIMA supplemented by SVG only.
Hybrid procedures, which combine minimally invasive arterial
grafting with PCI, proved feasible and safe. However, multicentre
studies are required to prove the efficacy and superiority of this
approach in stable, multivessel coronary disease.


15.1.6 Cross-Clamping
A single cross-clamp technique may be preferred to multiple manipulations of the aorta, with the aim of reducing atheroembolic events,
but a strict no-touch technique most effectively reduces embolization
of atherosclerotic material. [508][–][510] In cases of off-pump surgery, devices that allow a clampless procedure may help reduce the incidence
of cerebral vascular complications. [511][,][512]


15.1.7 Intraoperative quality control
Besides continuous ECG monitoring and transoesophageal echocardiography immediately after revascularization, intraoperative quality
control may also include graft flow measurement to confirm or
exclude a technical graft problem. [513] Transit-time flow measurement
is the most frequently used technique for graft assessment and has
been able to detect 2 - 4% of grafts that require revision. [513][,][514]

In observational studies, the use of intraoperative graft assessment
has been shown to reduce the rate of adverse events and graft failure,
although interpretation can be challenging in sequential and T-graft
configurations. [513][,][515][–][517]


15.1.8 On-pump and off-pump procedures

in 30 day or 1 year clinical outcomes between on- and off-pump surgery when performed by experienced surgeons. [518][–][520] There is also
evidence to conclude that, for most patients and surgeons, on-pump
surgery provides excellent short- and long-term outcomes. [518][,][520][–][523]

For some surgeons, off-pump surgery is associated with inferior early
and late graft patency rates, and possibly compromised long-term
survival; however, aortic no-touch/clampless off-pump procedures in
the hands of highly trained teams appear to be associated with a
reduced risk of early morbidity, such as stroke, and fewer transfusions. [508][–][510][,][524][–][528] In the subgroup of patients with end-stage
CKD, there is some evidence that off-pump surgery is associated
with lower in-hospital mortality and less need for new renal replacement therapy. [529]


A summary of these technical aspects can be found in Figure 8.

### 16 Procedural aspects of percutaneous coronary intervention

16.1 Percutaneous coronary intervention
devices

16.1.1 Balloon angioplasty
Plain balloon angioplasty has been superseded in the treatment of de
novo coronary lesions after demonstration of the superiority of stenting in terms of the requirement for repeat revascularization. [564]



selected patients in whom implantation of stents is not technically

feasible, or in a vessel that is considered to be too small to be stented.

Balloon angioplasty is no longer preferred to stenting with DES for
patients who require urgent non-cardiac surgery as short-duration
DAPT may be reasonable with both strategies. [565][,][566]

16.1.2 Choice of coronary stents
Stenting with BMS results in an approximately 30% lower rate of restenosis in comparison with plain balloon angioplasty. [564] Although many efforts
have been made to further reduce restenosis by the modification of stent
designs and materials, reducing the thickness of stent struts has been the
only proven modification capable of reducing restenosis of BMS. [567][,][568]

134 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


A major reduction in the risk of restenosis has been achieved with
DES technology. Early-generation DES released sirolimus [569] or paclitaxel [570] from a permanent polymer matrix coating on a relatively
thick-strut (120–140 mm) stainless steel backbone. These devices
reduced angiographic and clinical restenosis by approximately
50–70%, but increased the risk of very late stent thrombosis compared with BMS. [336][,][571]

Early-generation DES have now been supplanted by new-generation
DES. These stents represented an iterative development of early generation technology, including polymers with enhanced biocompatibility
(permanent or biodegradable), exclusively sirolimus-analogue active
drugs, and stent backbones with thin struts (50–100 mm) composed of
stainless steel, cobalt chromium, or platinum chromium. [572][–][577] Newgeneration DES have higher efficacy and safety in comparison with both
early-generation DES and BMS. [336][,][571][,][578] Although stenting with newgeneration DES confers a similar risk of death or MI at mid- to longterm follow-up in comparison with BMS, [579] the risk of subacute and late
stent thrombosis is significantly lower. [579][,][580] Moreover, the risk of very
late stent thrombosis is at least comparable to that of BMS and lower
than that of early-generation DES. [336][,][571][,][579][,][580] These observations
were confirmed in a recent trial enrolling patients aged 75 years or older
and demonstrating superior outcomes (composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, or ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization) with
DES as compared with BMS with similar duration of intended DAPT (1
month or 6 months) in both treatment arms. [581] Similarly, there is no

clear evidence of a difference between DES and BMS on the risk of stent
thrombosis following unplanned disruption of DAPT. [565] Accordingly,
new-generation DES should be preferred to BMS for routine use.
A large number of new-generation DES have received approval
for use and CE mark in Europe. [578] [Supplementary Table 6 displays a](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
list of new-generation DES with the CE mark and evidence from
large-scale clinical trials powered for clinical primary endpoints.
Biodegradable polymer and polymer-free DES offer the potential to
reduce late adverse events after PCI by eliminating inflammatory reactions to permanent polymer coatings. A number of large-scale trials
showed comparable efficacy and safety compared with permanent polymer stents. [575][,][576][,][582][–][590] However, at the moment, there is no evidence

of differential efficacy with new-generation biodegradable polymer DES
in comparison with new-generation permanent polymer DES in largescale randomized trials with follow-up out to 5 years. [591][–][594]

Regarding polymer-free DES, two large-scale trials with different
devices showed comparable results with new-generation DES and
superior results to BMS. [173][,][577] Long-term follow-up from randomized
trials vs. new-generation permanent polymer DES is only available for a
single device and shows comparable outcomes between the devices. [591]

The high clinical efficacy and safety of new-generation DES support
their preferred use in patients with an indication for PCI, including
patients with diabetes, CKD, multivessel and LMS disease, AMI, vein
grafts, restenotic lesions, and chronic total occlusions. Newgeneration DES should therefore be considered as the default stent
type for PCI regardless of clinical presentation, lesion subtype, concomitant therapies, or comorbidities.

16.1.3 Bioresorbable scaffolds

Completely bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS), which degrade to predominantly inert end products after fulfilling their scaffold function in the



of reducing or eliminating stent-related adverse events at long-term
follow-up. Current scaffold platforms to have reached clinical testing
are based on two different technologies: bioresorbable, polymerbased scaffolds (resorption up to 3–4 years) and resorbable, metallic
(magnesium) scaffolds (resorption up to 1 year). [595] Although a number of devices have received approval for use in Europe (see
[Supplementary Table 7), randomized trial data are available only with](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
the Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) (Abbott Vascular).
The safety and efficacy profile of the Absorb BVS has been compared with contemporary DES in several trials. Findings of these trials
as well as meta-analyses consistently indicate the inferior efficacy and
safety of Absorb BVS compared with contemporary DES during
long-term follow-up. Specifically, the Absorb BVS is associated with a
significantly increased risk of target lesion revascularization and
device thrombosis, with numbers needed to harm of 40–60. [596][,][597]

Of note, commercial use of the Absorb BVS was stopped in 2017
[(for additional details see the Supplementary Data).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
Available evidence on the magnesium scaffold is limited to small
observational studies. Initial results appear encouraging, but further

evaluation is needed. Therefore, the Task Force endorses the recom
mendation of the recent ESC/European Association for Percutaneous
Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) document on bioresorbable
scaffolds that any BRS should not be used outside well-controlled clinical studies. In patients who have been treated with BRS, prolongedduration DAPT for 3 years or longer may be considered.

16.1.4 Drug-coated balloons
The rationale for using DCBs is based on the concept that with highly
lipophilic drugs, even short contact times between the balloon surface
and the vessel wall are sufficient for effective drug delivery. There are
various types of DCB that are approved for use in Europe and their
[main characteristics are listed in Supplementary Table 8. Although spe-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
cifically designed comparative randomized trials are lacking, a class effect
for all DCBs cannot be assumed. [598] Randomized trial data supporting
the use of DCB angioplasty are limited to the treatment of in-stent
restenosis (see section 13.4). In terms of the use of DCB angioplasty for
de novo disease, a number of small randomized trials have been reported
with somewhat conflicting results. [599][–][601] At present, there are no convincing data to support the use of DCB angioplasty for this indication.

16.1.5 Devices for lesion preparation
Lesion preparation is critical for successful PCI. In addition to plain
balloon angioplasty (with standard or non-compliant balloons), cutting or scoring balloon angioplasty or rotational atherectomy may be
required in selected lesions—particularly those with heavy
calcification—in order to adequately dilate lesions prior to stent
implantation. However, studies investigating the systematic use of
these adjunctive technologies, such as rotational atherectomy, have
failed to show clear clinical benefit. [602]

16.2 Invasive imaging tools for
procedural guidance

16.2.1 Intravascular ultrasound

The majority of the existing clinical trial data relate to the use of IVUS
guidance during PCI. In the BMS era, several RCTs addressed the
potential of IVUS in reducing restenosis and adverse events after


Early-generation DES have now been supplanted by new-generation
DES. These stents represented an iterative development of early generation technology, including polymers with enhanced biocompatibility
(permanent or biodegradable), exclusively sirolimus-analogue active
drugs, and stent backbones with thin struts (50–100 mm) composed of
stainless steel, cobalt chromium, or platinum chromium. [572][–][577] Newgeneration DES have higher efficacy and safety in comparison with both
early-generation DES and BMS. [336][,][571][,][578] Although stenting with newgeneration DES confers a similar risk of death or MI at mid- to longterm follow-up in comparison with BMS, [579] the risk of subacute and late
stent thrombosis is significantly lower. [579][,][580] Moreover, the risk of very
late stent thrombosis is at least comparable to that of BMS and lower
than that of early-generation DES. [336][,][571][,][579][,][580] These observations
were confirmed in a recent trial enrolling patients aged 75 years or older
and demonstrating superior outcomes (composite of all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, or ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization) with
DES as compared with BMS with similar duration of intended DAPT (1
month or 6 months) in both treatment arms. [581] Similarly, there is no

clear evidence of a difference between DES and BMS on the risk of stent
thrombosis following unplanned disruption of DAPT. [565] Accordingly,
new-generation DES should be preferred to BMS for routine use.
A large number of new-generation DES have received approval
for use and CE mark in Europe. [578] [Supplementary Table 6 displays a](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
list of new-generation DES with the CE mark and evidence from
large-scale clinical trials powered for clinical primary endpoints.
Biodegradable polymer and polymer-free DES offer the potential to
reduce late adverse events after PCI by eliminating inflammatory reactions to permanent polymer coatings. A number of large-scale trials
showed comparable efficacy and safety compared with permanent polymer stents. [575][,][576][,][582][–][590] However, at the moment, there is no evidence

of differential efficacy with new-generation biodegradable polymer DES
in comparison with new-generation permanent polymer DES in largescale randomized trials with follow-up out to 5 years. [591][–][594]

Regarding polymer-free DES, two large-scale trials with different
devices showed comparable results with new-generation DES and
superior results to BMS. [173][,][577] Long-term follow-up from randomized
trials vs. new-generation permanent polymer DES is only available for a
single device and shows comparable outcomes between the devices. [591]

The high clinical efficacy and safety of new-generation DES support
their preferred use in patients with an indication for PCI, including
patients with diabetes, CKD, multivessel and LMS disease, AMI, vein
grafts, restenotic lesions, and chronic total occlusions. Newgeneration DES should therefore be considered as the default stent
type for PCI regardless of clinical presentation, lesion subtype, concomitant therapies, or comorbidities.


16.1.3 Bioresorbable scaffolds

Completely bioresorbable scaffolds (BRS), which degrade to predominantly inert end products after fulfilling their scaffold function in the
lesion site of the coronary vessel, have been developed with the goal

ESC/EACTS Guidelines 135


stenting, with somewhat conflicting results. Findings from one metaanalysis of randomized trials suggested better outcomes with IVUS
guidance in terms of acute procedural results and reduced angiographic
restenosis, repeat revascularization, and MACE, with no effect on
death and MI. [603][,][604] In the DES era, meta-analysis of randomized and
observational studies also suggests better clinical outcomes with IVUSguided vs. angiography-guided PCI. [605][,][606] However, the contribution of
findings from observational studies must be weighed against the likelihood of considerable residual confounding due to treatment selection
bias. Similarly, findings of improved outcome in patients undergoing LM
stem PCI with IVUS-guided PCI vs. angiography-guided PCI from a propensity score matched analysis must be interpreted with caution. [35]

In cases of stent failure, including restenosis and stent thrombosis,
the use of IVUS should be considered in order to identify and correct
underlying mechanical factors (see section 13). [386]

16.2.2 Optical coherence tomography
A number of studies have assessed OCT imaging for PCI guidance. Two
observational studies show that while OCT imaging changes operator
behaviour, its impact on clinical outcomes is unclear. [607][,][608] Indeed, OCT
is more accurate than angiography or IVUS in detecting subtle morphological details including malapposition, residual thrombus, plaque prolapse,
and residual dissections, although many of these additional findings may
have a benign course. [609][,][610] A single randomized trial compared OCT
with IVUS and coronary angiography, and showed that OCT-guided PCI

was safe and resulted in a similar minimum stent area to that of IVUSguided PCI. [611] However, OCT guidance was not superior to either IVUS
or angiography alone. An additional randomized trial that enrolled
patients with NSTE-ACS compared OCT-guided PCI with angiographyguided PCI and found no signal of impact on clinical outcomes. [612]

A number of observational studies have shown that OCT is feasi
ble and safe in the assessment of stent failure due to thrombosis, and
may yield information that may be clinically useful. [386][,][387][,][613][,][614]

Likewise, in cases of in-stent restenosis, intrastent neointimal tissue

may be characterized by OCT, enabling for example the detection of
neoatherosclerosis. [386][,][615][,][616] In cases of stent failure, the use of OCT

should be considered in order to identify and correct underlying
mechanical factors (see section 13).

16.3 Specific lesion subsets

16.3.1 Bifurcation stenosis

A number of RCTs have investigated the optimal intervention strategy in
patients with bifurcation lesions and showed no benefit for the systematic
two-stent approach vs. main branch-only stenting with provisional stenting of the side branch in terms of clinical outcomes. [617] A recent pooled
analysis of two RCTs showed lower 5 year survival in patients randomized to a systematic two-stent approach. [618] In addition, procedure time,
contrast volume, radiation exposure, and cost are higher with a twostent approach. [618] The EBC TWO (European Bifurcation Coronary
TWO) trial found no difference between a provisional T-stent strategy
and a systematic two-stent strategy (culotte technique) in terms of the
composite endpoint of death, MI, and TVR at 12 months among 200
patients with large-calibre true bifurcation lesions (side branch diameter
>_2.5 mm) and significant ostial disease length (>_5 mm). [619] Thus, main
branch-only stenting with provisional stenting of the side branch should



this rule, where upfront side branch stenting may be preferable, include
the presence of a large side branch (>_2.75 mm) with a long ostial side
branch lesion (>5 mm) or anticipated difficulty in accessing an important
side branch after main branch stenting, and true distal LM bifurcations.
Recently, a multicentre trial conducted in China directly compared a
double-kissing crush two-stent strategy with provisional stenting of the
main branch in 482 patients with distal LM bifurcation disease. Doublekissing crush resulted in a lower risk of the primary endpoint target lesion
failure at 1 year compared with provisional stenting. [620]

When a two-stent strategy is necessary, which two-stent technique
should be preferred is debated. The three most widely used contemporary two-stent techniques are culotte, crush (classic or doublekissing crush), and T and protrusion (TAP). [621][,][622] Several RCTs have
compared these techniques. In non-LM bifurcation lesions, there is no
compelling evidence that one technique is superior to the others in
terms of major clinical endpoints. [621][,][622] In LM true bifurcation lesions,
double-kissing crush has the most favourable outcome data. [623]

Final ‘kissing’ balloon dilation is generally recommended when two
stents are eventually required, with no advantage from final kissing
with the one-stent technique. [624][,][625] Several stents, designed specifically for the treatment of bifurcation lesions, have undergone extensive evaluation with promising angiographic and clinical results,
though RCTs against current recommended therapy are limited. [626]

Further technical details relating to bifurcation PCI are described in
the consensus document of the European Bifurcation Club. [627]

16.3.2 Chronic total coronary occlusion
Dedicated RCTs examining the outcomes of patients with chronic
total occlusion (CTO) allocated to revascularization or conservative
therapy are scarce. One trial randomized patients with STEMI and
CTO in a non-culprit vessel to CTO-PCI vs. conservative therapy, and
found no difference in the primary endpoint of LVEF and LV enddiastolic volume at 4 months. [628] More recently, the prospective
randomized EUROCTO (Randomized Multicentre Trial to Compare
Revascularization With Optimal Medical Therapy for the Treatment
of Chronic Total Occlusions) trial showed symptomatic improvement
by PCI of CTO. [629] This trial included 396 patients who were randomly assigned to PCI of CTO with optimal medical therapy, or optimal medical therapy alone. During the 12 month follow-up, the
primary endpoint-the change in health status assessed by the Seattle
angina questionnaire-showed significantly greater improvement of
angina frequency and quality of life with CTO PCI as compared with
optimal medical therapy alone. Yet, MACE were comparable between
the two groups. A systematic review of 25 observational studies
showed that at median follow-up of 3 years, successful CTO-PCI was
associated with improved clinical outcomes in comparison with failed
revascularization, including overall survival, angina burden, and the
requirement for bypass surgery. [630] Broadly speaking, the treatment of
CTOs may be considered analogous to the treatment of non-CTO
lesions (see recommendations in section 5). In cases of regional wall
motion abnormalities in the territory of the CTO, objective evidence
of viability should be sought. The decision to attempt CTO-PCI
should be considered against the risk of greater contrast volume, longer fluoroscopy time, and higher MACE rates in comparison with
non-CTO PCI patients. [631] Ad hoc PCI is generally not recommended
for CTOs, although it may be necessary in selected cases (e.g. acute
bypass graft failure not amenable to recanalization of the bypass graft).


In cases of stent failure, including restenosis and stent thrombosis,
the use of IVUS should be considered in order to identify and correct
underlying mechanical factors (see section 13). [386]


16.2.2 Optical coherence tomography
A number of studies have assessed OCT imaging for PCI guidance. Two
observational studies show that while OCT imaging changes operator
behaviour, its impact on clinical outcomes is unclear. [607][,][608] Indeed, OCT
is more accurate than angiography or IVUS in detecting subtle morphological details including malapposition, residual thrombus, plaque prolapse,
and residual dissections, although many of these additional findings may
have a benign course. [609][,][610] A single randomized trial compared OCT
with IVUS and coronary angiography, and showed that OCT-guided PCI

was safe and resulted in a similar minimum stent area to that of IVUSguided PCI. [611] However, OCT guidance was not superior to either IVUS
or angiography alone. An additional randomized trial that enrolled
patients with NSTE-ACS compared OCT-guided PCI with angiographyguided PCI and found no signal of impact on clinical outcomes. [612]

A number of observational studies have shown that OCT is feasi
ble and safe in the assessment of stent failure due to thrombosis, and
may yield information that may be clinically useful. [386][,][387][,][613][,][614]

Likewise, in cases of in-stent restenosis, intrastent neointimal tissue

may be characterized by OCT, enabling for example the detection of
neoatherosclerosis. [386][,][615][,][616] In cases of stent failure, the use of OCT

should be considered in order to identify and correct underlying
mechanical factors (see section 13).


16.3 Specific lesion subsets

16.3.1 Bifurcation stenosis

A number of RCTs have investigated the optimal intervention strategy in
patients with bifurcation lesions and showed no benefit for the systematic
two-stent approach vs. main branch-only stenting with provisional stenting of the side branch in terms of clinical outcomes. [617] A recent pooled
analysis of two RCTs showed lower 5 year survival in patients randomized to a systematic two-stent approach. [618] In addition, procedure time,
contrast volume, radiation exposure, and cost are higher with a twostent approach. [618] The EBC TWO (European Bifurcation Coronary
TWO) trial found no difference between a provisional T-stent strategy
and a systematic two-stent strategy (culotte technique) in terms of the
composite endpoint of death, MI, and TVR at 12 months among 200
patients with large-calibre true bifurcation lesions (side branch diameter
>_2.5 mm) and significant ostial disease length (>_5 mm). [619] Thus, main
branch-only stenting with provisional stenting of the side branch should
be the preferred approach for most bifurcation lesions. Exceptions to

136 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


Recent developments in catheter and wire technology, and
increasing operator expertise with both antegrade and retrograde
approaches as well as wire escalation and dissection/re-entry techniques, have translated into increasing success rates of CTO-PCI with
low rates of MACE. [631][–][633] Success rates are strongly dependent on
operator skills, depending on experience with specific procedural
techniques, and the availability of dedicated equipment, and vary
from 60–70% to >90%. [631][–][633]

16.3.3 Ostial lesions

In ostial coronary lesions, additional judgement and caution is essential before proceeding to PCI. In particular, a catheter-induced coronary spasm must be rigorously excluded. Lesion assessment with
IVUS may be helpful, particularly in LM ostial stenosis. FFR measurement may also be valuable in the assessment of ostial lesions of borderline significance, [634] taking special care to avoid a wedge position
of the guiding catheter and using i.v., rather than intracoronary,
between the guide catheter and the proximal stent edge, the risk of
longitudinal stent deformation must be considered [635] and avoided
with careful catheter manipulation. The accurate positioning of the
stent, precisely in the coronary ostium, may be technically challenging
and some specialized techniques that may help to achieve optimal
stent placement have been described. [636][,][637]

16.4 Vascular access

A number of RCTs have compared radial access with femoral access
for diagnostic angiography and PCI. The two largest were RIVAL
(Radial versus femoral access for coronary angiography and intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes) and MATRIX
(Minimizing Adverse Haemorrhagic Events by Transradial access Site
and Systemic Implementation of AngioX). [172][,][638] In the RIVAL trial,
which enrolled 7021 patients, the primary outcome of death, MI,


stroke, or non-CABG-related major bleeding at 30 days occurred at a
similar rate in radial vs. femoral access (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72–1.17, P =
0.50). [638] In the MATRIX trial, 8404 ACS patients were randomly allocated to radial or femoral access. [172] In terms of the first co-primary
endpoint of 30 day MACE, there was no significant difference between
radial access and femoral access (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74–0.99, twosided P = 0.031; non-significant at a pre-specified a of 0.025). The second co-primary outcome of 30 day net adverse clinical events [MACE
or non-CABG BARC (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium
(major bleeding] was significantly lower with radial access (RR 0.83,
95% CI 0.73–0.96; P = 0.009). Major BARC 3 or 5 bleeding was significantly reduced in the radial group (1.6 vs. 2.3%; RR 0.67, 95% CI
0.49–0.92; P = 0.013), and radial access was associated with a lower
risk of all-cause mortality (1.6 vs. 2.2%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53–0.99,
P = 0.045). However, the benefit of radial over femoral access depends
upon the operator’s expertise in the radial technique. [639]

cussed in section 13.3.

### 17 Antithrombotic treatments

Antithrombotic treatment is mandatory in CAD patients undergoing
myocardial revascularization. The choice of treatment, the combination,
the time point of initiation, and the duration depend on the patient’s


ischaemic and bleeding events significantly influence the outcome
of CAD patients and their overall mortality risk during and after
myocardial revascularization. [664] Thus, the choice of treatment should
reflect the ischaemic and bleeding risk. The recommended drugs
(Figure 9) and doses (Table 7) for anticoagulant and antiplatelet
drugs used in conjunction with myocardial revascularization are

summarized below.




|Antiplatelet drugs|Col2|
|---|---|
|Aspirin|Loading dose of 150–300 mg orally or 75–150 mg i.v. if oral ingestion is not possible, followed by<br>a maintenance dose of 75–100 mg/day.|

17.1 Percutaneous coronary intervention
in stable coronary artery disease
17.1.1 Choice of treatment and pre-treatment
DAPT consisting of aspirin and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor represents
the cornerstone of treatment in patients undergoing elective PCI. [665]

The P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor clopidogrel is recommended for elective stenting procedures. For routine clopidogrel pre-treatment
(administration of the drug when the coronary anatomy is unknown),
there is no compelling evidence for a significant clinical benefit in
SCAD patients. [666][–][668] Thus, pre-treatment may only be an option in
selected patients with high probability of PCI or before staged PCI
procedures. Figures 9 and 10 summarize the commonly used antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs in SCAD patients undergoing PCI.

17.1.2 Peri-interventional treatment

While aspirin and clopidogrel are indicated for elective stenting procedures, prasugrel or ticagrelor may only be considered in selected
patients for specific high-risk situations of elective stenting (e.g. complex PCI procedures such as LM stenting and CTO procedures) or in
patients with a history of stent thrombosis on clopidogrel treatment.
In parallel with antiplatelet treatment, the use of anticoagulants is
standard of care during elective PCI to inhibit thrombin generation



and bivalirudin, have been evaluated for their use in clinical practice.
The REPLACE-2 (Randomised Evaluation in PCI Linking Angiomax to
Reduced Clinical Events 2) trial demonstrated that the outcome with
bivalirudin and provisional glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa blockade is similar to that of UFH plus planned GP IIb/IIIa inhibition during elective
PCI. [669] The ISAR-REACT (Intracoronary Stenting and
Antithrombotic Regimen Rapid Early Action for Coronary
Treatment) 3 trial also showed a similar outcome for bivalirudin vs.
UFH treatment. [670] In ISAR REACT 3A, [671] evaluating a lower dose of
100 U/kg UFH, this lower dose showed net clinical benefit compared
with the historical control cohort and this benefit was mostly driven
by a reduction in bleeding events. In view of the primary endpoint

results of the RCTs and in view of a trend towards a lower risk of MI,

UFH remains the standard anticoagulant for elective PCI. Based on
the results of the STEEPLE (Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous
Enoxaparin in Elective Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
Randomised Evaluation) trial, enoxaparin should be considered as an
alternative anticoagulant drug. [672]

Drugs for parenteral antiplatelet treatment include cangrelor
and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Cangrelor is a direct reversible, shortacting P2Y 12 -inhibitor that has been evaluated during PCI for
SCAD and ACS in clinical trials comparing cangrelor with clopidogrel, administered before PCI [CHAMPION (Cangrelor versus
Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet


The P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor clopidogrel is recommended for elective stenting procedures. For routine clopidogrel pre-treatment
(administration of the drug when the coronary anatomy is unknown),
there is no compelling evidence for a significant clinical benefit in
SCAD patients. [666][–][668] Thus, pre-treatment may only be an option in

Inhibition) PCI] or after PCI (CHAMPION PLATFORM and
CHAMPION PHOENIX). [673] A meta-analysis showed a benefit
with respect to major ischaemic endpoints that is counterbalanced by an increase in relevant bleeding. [673] Moreover, the
benefit of cangrelor with respect to ischaemic endpoints was attenuated in CHAMPION PCI with upfront administration of clopidogrel. Nevertheless, due to its proven efficacy in preventing
intraprocedural and post-procedural stent thrombosis in P2Y 12 inhibitor naı¨ve patients, cangrelor may be considered in P2Y 12 inhibitor naı¨ve patients undergoing PCI (for more detailed discus[sion see the Supplementary Data).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
Available GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. In a setting of elective PCI, clinical trials did not demonstrate an

additional benefit of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration in SCAD

patients in a setting of DAPT treatment that includes loading with clopidogrel. [674][,][675] A meta-analysis on this topic revealed no mortality ben
efit of GP IIb/IIIa treatment and while non-fatal MIs were reduced,

(minor) bleeding events were significantly higher when utilizing these
agents. [676] Thus, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors may only be considered in specific
‘bail-out’ situations including high intraprocedural thrombus burden,


An algorithm for the use of antithrombotic drugs in patients undergoing PCI is shown in Figure 10.

17.1.3 Post-interventional and maintenance treatment

Following elective stenting, DAPT consisting of clopidogrel in addition to aspirin is generally recommended for 6 months, irrespective
of the stent type. In specific clinical scenarios, this standard DAPT
duration can be shortened (<6 months) or extended (>6–12
months). For a more detailed description of the pertinent clinical tri
als in the field of DAPT duration, we refer the reader to the 2017

ESC Focused Update on Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Coronary
Artery Disease. [410] Following DAPT, a life-long single antiplatelet
therapy (usually with aspirin) is recommended, and patients should
be advised not to prematurely discontinue oral antiplatelet therapy
after stenting due to the risks of stent thrombosis and recurrent
MI. [677] Recently, the value of a vascular dose of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg
b.i.d.) in conjunction with aspirin was demonstrated in the large-scale
COMPASS (Rivaroxaban for the Prevention of Major Cardiovascular
Events in Coronary or Peripheral Artery Disease) trial. [678] However,
its utilization in SCAD patients is a matter of secondary prevention
and is not linked to myocardial revascularization procedures.

ESC/EACTS Guidelines 141


17.2 Non-ST-segment elevation acute
coronary syndrome
The activation of blood platelets and the coagulation cascade plays a
key role in the initial phase and evolution of an ACS. Hence, sufficient
platelet inhibition and anticoagulation is essential during ACS, and
especially in ACS patients undergoing PCI.

17.2.1 Choice of treatment and pre-treatment
For NSTE-ACS patients, DAPT including aspirin and a potent P2Y 12
receptor inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor) is recommended (see the
[Supplementary Data).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data) [701][,][702] Clopidogrel should only be used when
prasugrel or ticagrelor are not available or are contraindicated. Based
on the results of the ACCOAST (Comparison of Prasugrel at the
Time of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or as Pretreatment at
the Time of Diagnosis in Patients with Non-ST Elevation Myocardial
Infarction) trial, [165] it is not recommended that prasugrel is administered in patients in whom coronary anatomy is not known.
Nevertheless, pre-treatment with ticagrelor was part of the PLATO
trial (Study of Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) and was
associated with an early benefit over clopidogrel. [702] For these reasons, pre-treatment with ticagrelor can be used, although there is no
direct evidence from head-to-head comparisons between pre
treatment strategies.

17.2.2 Peri-interventional treatment

Anticoagulation is recommended for all patients in addition to antiplatelet therapy during PCI for NSTE-ACS. [703] In general, a crossover
between anticoagulants should be avoided [especially between UFH
and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)], with the exception of
adding UFH to fondaparinux when a patient proceeds to PCI. [704][,][705]

The respective agents should be discontinued after PCI except for
specific clinical settings, such as the presence of an LV aneurysm with
thrombus or AF requiring anticoagulation.
A number of trials have compared bivalirudin with UFH in ACS
[patients undergoing PCI (see the Supplementary Data). Some of](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
these trials pursued a balanced use of adjunctive GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors
with both bivalirudin and heparin, whereas others, predominantly the
older ones, had selective use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the heparin
arm. These trials have been reviewed extensively in a number of
meta-analyses. [706][–][708] A meta-analysis that included the MATRIX trial
but not VALIDATE-SWEDEHEART (Bivalirudin versus Heparin in
ST-Segment and Non-ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction in
Patients on Modern Antiplatelet Therapy on the Swedish Websystem for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care
in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies)
showed no significant benefit of bivalirudin compared with UFH with
respect to death, MACE, and MI. [708] Nevertheless, bivalirudin was
associated with a significant increase in the risk of stent thrombosis
and a significant decrease in the risk of bleeding. However, the reduction of bleeding risk was linked to unbalanced use of GP IIb/IIa inhibitors predominantly with UFH. Recently, the VALIDATESWEDEHEART study [709] compared UFH vs. bivalirudin in a background of radial access and limited use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. The
study demonstrated similar risk patterns for both ischaemia and
bleeding when comparing the two drugs. Of note, while prior studies



not confirmed in VALIDATE-SWEDEHEART and in a contemporary
setting of preferred radial access and selective use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. More recently, a meta-analysis updated for the results of
VALIDATE-SWEDEHEART confirmed that bivalirudin compared
with heparin was associated with a similar incidence of all-cause death
and ischaemic events after PCI for ACS. [710] A significant association of
bivalirudin with decreased risk of bleeding was only found with unbalanced use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in conjunction with heparin. In summary and based on the above-mentioned trials, UFH is primarily
recommended as an anticoagulant for PCI. Due to its short half-life
and favourable results in some of the studies, bivalirudin may be con
sidered as an alternative to UFH in selected cases.

Patients may undergo cardiac catheterization after a conservative
treatment phase and these patients are commonly treated with fondaparinux during the conservative treatment phase. This regimen is
based on the OASIS-5 (Optimal Antiplatelet Strategy for
Interventions 5) trial. [711] Of note, catheter thrombus formation was
an issue with fondaparinux and therefore full-dose UFH must be
added to prevent thrombus formation when the patient proceeds to
PCI. Enoxaparin should be considered as anticoagulant for PCI in
patients pre-treated with subcutaneous enoxaparin. A benefit of
enoxaparin over UFH in reducing mortality and bleeding complications was recently reported in a meta-analysis including NSTE-ACS
patients. [689] Yet, this meta-analysis did not include a dedicated
randomized study in NSTE-ACS and was largely based on nonrandomized comparisons.
Most of the trials evaluating GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in PCI-treated
patients pre-date the era of routine oral DAPT treatment. These
early trials demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of ischaemic

events in favour of GP IIb/IIIa treatment in combination with UFH
compared with UFH alone, primarily through a reduction in MI. [712]

However, coronary angiography and PCI were delayed compared
with what is recommended now, and a consistent major bleeding risk
was observed. Overall, there is no compelling evidence for an additional benefit of routine upstream use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in
NSTE-ACS patients scheduled for coronary angiography and receiving DAPT treatment. [713][,][714] In a setting of potent platelet inhibition
with ticagrelor or prasugrel, where randomized data on GP IIb/IIIa
inhibitor use is limited, routine use of these agents cannot be recom
mended. Nevertheless, it should be considered for bail-out situations

or thrombotic complications, and may be used for high-risk PCI in
patients without pre-treatment with P2Y 12 -inhibitors. The available
evidence on cangrelor suggests that the potential benefit is independent of the clinical presentation. Thus, similar to SCAD patients, cangrelor may be considered in specific settings in P2Y 12 -naı¨ve patients
undergoing PCI.

17.2.3 Post-interventional and maintenance treatment

Following PCI for NSTE-ACS, DAPT consisting of a P2Y 12 receptor
inhibitor in addition to aspirin is generally recommended for 12
months, irrespective of the stent type. Recently, the SMART-DATE
(Smart Angioplasty Research Team-safety of 6-month duration of
Dual Antiplatelet Therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention
in patients with acute coronary syndromes) prospective multicentre
randomized trial supported this notion in the setting of contemporary interventional practice. The study randomly assigned 2712


17.2.1 Choice of treatment and pre-treatment
For NSTE-ACS patients, DAPT including aspirin and a potent P2Y 12
receptor inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor) is recommended (see the

A number of trials have compared bivalirudin with UFH in ACS
[patients undergoing PCI (see the Supplementary Data). Some of](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)

patients undergoing PCI for NSTE-ACS or STEMI to either 6 month
DAPT or 12 month or longer DAPT. Although the primary
endpoint—a composite of all-cause death, MI, or stroke—did not
confirm the benefit of prolonged DAPT over 6 month DAPT (cumulative event rate 4.7 vs. 4.2%; absolute risk difference 0.5%; upper limit
of one-sided 95% CI 1.8%; P non-inferiority = 0.03 with a predefined noninferiority margin of 2.0%), MI occurred more frequently in the 6
month DAPT group than in the prolonged DAPT group (1.8 vs. 0.8%;
P = 0.02). The rate of BARC type 2 - 5 bleeding was not significantly
affected by prolonged DAPT (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.45–1.05, P = 0.09).

The authors stated that the increased risk of MI with 6 month DAPT

and the wide non-inferiority margin prevented them from concluding
that short-term DAPT was safe in this setting, and suggested that prolonged DAPT should remain the standard of care in patients with
ACS without excessive risk of bleeding. [715]

In specific clinical scenarios, this standard DAPT duration can be
shortened (<12 months) or extended (>12 months). Further on,
switching and especially a de-escalation of DAPT (switching from
potent P2Y 12 -inhibitors to clopidogrel) was subject to a number of
randomized clinical trials. [716][,][717] Triggers for DAPT de-escalation
include clinical (bleeding events or presumed high bleeding risk) and
socio-economic factors. [716] Based on recent results from the


inhibition on chronic antiplatelet treatment for acute coronary syndromes) trial [717], an approach of DAPT de-escalation guided by platelet function testing may be considered in ACS patients (NSTE-ACS
and STEMI) as an alternative to 12 months potent platelet inhibition,
especially for patients deemed unsuitable for maintained potent platelet inhibition. For a more detailed description of the pertinent clinical trials in the field of DAPT duration and switching antiplatelet
drugs, we refer the reader to the International Expert Consensus
document on Switching Platelet P2Y12 Receptor-Inhibiting
Therapies [718] and the 2017 ESC Focused Update on Dual Antiplatelet
Therapy in Coronary Artery Disease. [410] Following DAPT, lifelong
single antiplatelet therapy (usually with aspirin) is recommended and
patients should be advised not to prematurely discontinue oral antiplatelet therapy after stenting. [677][,][719]

Based on the results of the ATLAS-ACS 2–TIMI 51 (Anti-Xa
Therapy to Lower cardiovascular events in Addition to Standard
therapy in subjects with Acute Coronary Syndrome–Thrombolysis
In Myocardial Infarction 51) trial in NSTE-ACS and STEMI patients, [720]

low-dose rivaroxaban may be considered after discontinuation of
parenteral anticoagulation for patients with no prior stroke/TIA, and
at high ischaemic risk as well as low bleeding risk, receiving aspirin
and clopidogrel. Of note, rivaroxaban has not been investigated in a
background of potent P2Y 12 -inhibitors.

17.3 ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction

17.3.1 Choice of treatment and pre-treatment
STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI should receive aspirin and a
P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor as soon as the diagnosis of STEMI is estab
lished. In line with the treatment recommendations for NSTE-ACS

patients, DAPT is the cornerstone of treatment for STEMI patients
and includes aspirin and a potent P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor (prasugrel
or ticagrelor). [701][,][702] For both antiplatelet drugs, published subgroup
[analyses on STEMI patients are available (see the Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
[Data). Randomized data on a comparison of ticagrelor vs. prasugrel](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
in STEMI patients are limited, but the recently published randomized
PRAGUE-18 (Comparison of Prasugrel and Ticagrelor in the
Treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial [735] with limited statistical power found similar safety and efficacy profiles of ticagrelor and
prasugrel in a setting of primary PCI. When potent P2Y 12 receptor
inhibitors are contraindicated or are not available, clopidogrel should
be given for primary PCI instead. [724] The value of pre-treatment with
ticagrelor was addressed in the ATLANTIC (Administration of
Ticagrelor in the Cath Lab or in the Ambulance for New STElevation Myocardial Infarction to Open the Coronary Artery)
trial. [736] No significant differences were observed in the levels of the
two co-primary surrogate endpoints measured before PCI (thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow and ST-segment resolution).
Likewise, the incidence of a combined ischaemic endpoint (death, MI,
stroke, stent thrombosis, and urgent revascularization) did not differ

between the two treatment arms. Nevertheless, in both the

TRITON (TRial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes
by Optimizing Platelet InhibitioN with Prasugrel–Thrombolysis In
Myocardial Infarction) and PLATO trials, pre-treatment was part of
the therapeutic regimen in STEMI.

17.3.2 Peri-interventional treatment

Immediate and sufficient anticoagulation is mandatory in the setting
of primary PCI for STEMI and available options include UFH, bivalirudin, and enoxaparin. A number of RCTs compared bivalirudin vs.
UFH in different settings and with different utilization of GP IIb/IIIa
[inhibitors (see the Supplementary Data). The primary recommenda-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
tion of UFH, reserving bivalirudin for selected cases, is essentially the
same for primary PCI as for PCI in NSTE-ACS, and is mostly based
on the same clinical trials [706][,][709] (see section 17.2.2).
Enoxaparin was compared with UFH in the randomized openlabel ATOLL (Acute STEMI Treated with primary PCI and intravenous enoxaparin Or UFH to Lower ischaemic and bleeding events at
short- and Long-term follow-up) trial, [737] and based on the trial
results, enoxaparin should be considered as an alternative to UFH
treatment in STEMI patients.
A number of clinical trials, performed at a time when pretreatment and potent platelet inhibition was not part of routine clinical practice, have documented clinical benefits of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors
as an adjunct to primary PCI performed with UFH. [738][,][739] A metaanalysis showed a significant survival benefit, especially in high-risk
STEMI patients, but also a higher risk of bleeding with GP IIb/IIIa
administration. [740] Dedicated trials have investigated the value of
upstream treatment in the past. [741][,][742] Based upon the available evidence, the routine use of i.v. or intracoronary GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor


administration—regardless of whether treatment starts upstream or
in the catheterization laboratory—cannot be recommended.
Especially in a setting where potent P2Y 12 -inhibitors like prasugrel or
ticagrelor are used, the value of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors remains uncertain as these agents exhibit a fast onset of action (usually <1 h). GP
IIb/IIIa inhibitors remain an option as bail-out therapy or in high-risk
PCI without pre-treatment with P2Y 12 -inhibitors. Of note, the bail
out scenarios have never been addressed in randomized controlled

trials. For reasons discussed above (see sections 17.1 and 17.2), cangrelor may be considered in specific settings in P2Y 12 -naı¨ve patients
undergoing PCI.

17.3.3 Post-interventional and maintenance treatment

Following PCI for STEMI, DAPT consisting of a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor in addition to aspirin is generally recommended for 12 months.
Recommendations for maintenance DAPT treatment are generally
consistent with those for NSTE-ACS patients and are detailed in sec
tion 17.2.3.

17.4 Coronary artery bypass grafting

Antithrombotic treatment before and after CABG is addressed in

the 2017 ESC Focused Update on Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in
Coronary Artery Disease. [410] After reviewing the subsequent litera
ture, the current Task Force endorses the recommendations of the

update on DAPT and does not identify a need for any major update.
Accordingly, the recommendation tables in this section are taken
from the Focused Update. For a detailed discussion, we refer the
reader to the Focused Update.



|In patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or<br>STEMI) treated with DAPT who are<br>undergoing CABG and do not require<br>long-term OAC therapy, resumption of<br>P2Y inhibitor therapy as soon as<br>12<br>deemed safe after surgery and its contin-<br>uation up to 12 months is<br>recommended.|I|C|
|---|---|---|
|In patients on P2Y inhibitors who<br>12<br>need to undergo non-emergent cardiac<br>surgery, postponing surgery for at least<br>3 days after discontinuation of ticagre-<br>lor, at least 5 days after clopidogrel, and<br>at least 7 days after prasugrel should be<br>considered.747–749|IIa|B|
|In CABG patients with prior MI who are<br>at high risk of severe bleeding (e.g.<br>PRECISE-DAPT >_25), discontinuation of<br>P2Y inhibitor therapy after 6 months<br>12<br>should be considered.|IIa|C|

|In patients perceived to be at high<br>ischaemic risk with prior MI and CABG,<br>who have tolerated DAPT without a<br>bleeding complication, treatment with<br>DAPT for longer than 12 months and up<br>to 36 months may be considered.|IIb|C|






17.5 Special conditions
17.5.1 Antithrombotic therapy after percutaneous
coronary intervention in patients requiring oral
anticoagulation
Compared with OAC therapy alone, the addition of DAPT to OAC
therapy results in a two- to three-fold increase in bleeding complications, suggesting that every effort should be undertaken to avoid
bleeding (Table 8). [753] Assessing the balance of ischaemic and bleeding
risks of relatively short (i.e. <_6 months) triple therapy duration compared with double therapy consisting of clopidogrel and an OAC


|Recommendations|Classa|Levelb|
|---|---|---|
|It is recommended that the Heart Team<br>estimates the individual bleeding and<br>ischaemic risks, and guides the timing of<br>CABG as well as the anti-thrombotic<br>management.|I|C|
|In patients on aspirin who need to<br>undergo non-emergent cardiac surgery,<br>it is recommended to continue aspirin at<br>a low daily regimen throughout the peri-<br>operative period.|I|C|

146 ESC/EACTS Guidelines


requires patient-by-patient decisions. Of note, previous randomized
studies evaluating the duration of triple therapy or the benefit of
NOACs vs. vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were not adequately powered to assess ischaemic events, and data are lacking on the efficacy
of dual therapy in patients at high risk of stroke or recurrent
ACS. [754][–][757] In the major trials, there was no interaction between the
duration of triple therapy and clinical presentation (ACS vs. no ACS).
The rate of bleeding events peaked within the first 30 days of initiation of triple therapy, and was twice as high when compared with the
rate of acute coronary events including recurrent MI and stent
thrombosis. For these reasons, the duration of triple therapy should
be minimized depending on bleeding and ischaemic risks (see Tables 8
to 10 for guidance in decision-making). In stabilized event-free
patients, discontinuation of any antiplatelet agent at 1 year after stenting is encouraged, while dual therapy may be continued beyond 1
year according to the stent-driven risk shown in Table 9.
Based on the favourable bleeding risk in the large phase 3 studies, a
NOAC should be preferred over a VKA. The PIONEER [756]

(Prevention of bleeding in patients with AF undergoing PCI) trial and
the more recent RE-DUAL (Randomised Evaluation of Dual
Antithrombotic Therapy with Dabigatran versus Triple Therapy with
Warfarin in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) [757] trial compared a NOAC
plus single antiplatelet therapy with triple therapy with a VKA plus
DAPT and consistently showed significantly lower bleeding risks with
the dual antithrombotic regimen. In RE-DUAL, both dosing regimens
for dabigatran (150 mg and 110 mg b.i.d.) vs. warfarin triple therapy
were associated with a significant reduction of major or clinically



relevant bleeding events. However, as compared with triple therapy,
an increase in both MI (4.5 vs. 3.0%, P = 0.09) and stent thrombosis
risk (1.5 vs. 0.8%, P = 0.15) was reported for the lower dabigatran
dose (110 mg b.i.d.), but not for the higher dabigatran dose (150 mg
b.i.d.). Although statistical significance was missed, these findings raise
concern about the efficacy of the lower dabigatran dose in combination with single antiplatelet therapy in preventing coronary events.
Thus, the 150 mg b.i.d. dose of dabigatran is preferred. At present,
evidence for a dual treatment approach is available for VKA, [755] rivaroxaban, [756] and dabigatran, [757] but none of these studies were powered to assess the efficacy of preventing stent thrombosis or
thrombo-embolic events and only RE-DUAL used a NOAC dose
that was previously shown to be effective in the prevention of
thrombo-embolic events. The ongoing AUGUSTUS trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02415400) will address the value of
apixaban in a similar setting, and with and without aspirin. Edoxaban
is currently being investigated in a setting of triple treatment in the
ENTRUST-AF-PCI (Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of an edoxaban-based antithrombotic regimen in patients with atrial fibrillation
following successful percutaneous coronary intervention) trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02866175).
Figure 11 illustrates applicable DAPT algorithms in patients with an
indication for OAC undergoing PCI with the respective classes of
recommendations for the different treatment regimens. For more
details on the pertinent studies in the field of triple treatment (DAPT
plus OAC) and the associated issues, we refer the reader to the 2017

Artery Disease. [410]

hospital admission in NSTE-ACS patients, has not been addressed in

dedicated randomized studies.

The safety and efficacy of short-term potent antiplatelet treatment
with either prasugrel or ticagrelor in SCAD patients is unknown, and
is subject to ongoing clinical trials [the ALPHEUS (Assessment of
Loading With the P2Y 12 Inhibitor Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel to Halt
Ischemic Events in Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Stenting)
trial: NCT02617290 and the SASSICAIA (Comparison of Loading
Strategies With Antiplatelet Drugs in Patients Undergoing Elective
Coronary Intervention) trial: NCT02548611].
The clinical benefit of a short-term DAPT duration followed by
long-term ticagrelor monotherapy (and stopping aspirin) remains
unknown. The ongoing GLOBAL LEADERS (Long-term ticagrelor
monotherapy versus standard dual antiplatelet therapy followed
by aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing biolimus-eluting
stent implantation) and TWILIGHT (Ticagrelor With Aspirin or
Alone in High-Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention) trials aim
to close this gap in our current knowledge (NCT01813435 and
NCT02270242, respectively).
### 18 Volume outcome relationship for revascularization procedures

Operator experience influences outcomes, particularly in critical,
complex situations. Greater total experience of an entire hospital
team—consisting of the supporting members in the operating room
or catheterization laboratory and those responsible for postopera
tive care—results in more favourable outcomes.

18.1 Coronary artery bypass grafting
Studies have suggested that the volume of CABG surgery in a hospital significantly impacts in-hospital mortality, although no consistent cut-offs for volume were used in these studies. [761][–][762] This

increase in mortality observed in lower volume centres seems to
be attributable to so-called ‘failure to rescue’: although patients
operated on at low-volume centres are not at particularly higher
risk of suffering a major complication, they are more likely to die
from such a complication should it occur. [763] Therefore, consideration should be given to the performance of CABG in centres
with an annual volume of at least 200 CABG cases. Apart from
hospital volume, higher surgeon volume also appears to be inversely related to operative mortality. Birkmeyer et al. provided evidence suggesting that both hospitals and surgeons have some
impact on outcomes. [764]

Several studies suggest that quality measures are more



hospitals strongly predicted mortality, irrespective of surgeon or hospital case volumes. [767] Therefore, it is recommended that such quality
[measures (as an example see Supplementary Table 9) are](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)
adopted and reported to facilitate focused quality improvement. [768]

18.2 Percutaneous coronary
intervention

Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between the
volume of procedures and outcomes of PCI, suggesting a
volume–outcome relationship at the operator level, as well as at the
institutional level. [761][,][769][–][773] A population-based study from the PCI
reporting system of New York indicated that hospital case volumes
<400 PCIs per year and operator case volumes <75 PCIs per year
were associated with impaired outcomes. [769]

Among patients with ACS, particularly STEMI, operator and hospital volumes play important roles. A large study in the USA reported
that, in a cohort of 36 535 patients undergoing primary PCI, inhospital mortality was significantly lower in institutions with higher
primary PCI volumes (5.7% in hospitals performing >33 primary
PCIs/year vs. 7.7% in hospitals performing <12 primary PCIs/year). [774]

Operator volume has also been shown to impact outcomes in LM
PCI. A single-centre study of 1948 patients who underwent unprotected LM PCI, performed by 25 operators over a 7 year period,
showed reduced 30 day and 3 year mortality for patients who had
their PCI performed by a high-volume operator (defined as >_15 LM
PCI/year; mean 25/year) vs. a low-volume operator (<15 LM PCI/
year). [775]

An example of quality measures for PCI is provided in
[Supplementary Table 10.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy394#supplementary-data)

18.3 Training in cardiac surgery and
interventional cardiology for myocardial
revascularization

A European training programme in interventional cardiology has
been proposed by the EAPCI in order to ensure the high quality of
patient care and clinical excellence. [776] The programme should last
1–2 years at high-volume institutions that handle >_800 PCIs per year
and that have an established 24 h/7 day service for the treatment of
patients with ACS.
For CABG, no standardized European programme exists at
this time. However, the pace at which proficiency reaches certain
acceptable standards differs from trainee to trainee. Therefore,
although it is recommended that trainees perform >_200 CABG procedures under supervision before becoming completely independent, a competency-driven residency programme with regular
evaluation of progress is recommended over a volume-driven

programme.

### 19 Medical therapy, secondary prevention, and strategies for follow-up

Myocardial revascularization must be accompanied by medical therapy and other secondary prevention strategies for risk factor modification and permanent lifestyle changes. [42] Secondary prevention and
cardiac rehabilitation are an integral part of management after revascularization because such measures reduce future morbidity and
mortality in a cost-effective way, and can further improve symptoms.
These measures are discussed in detail in the European Guidelines
on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention that were published in 2016. [42]

The need to detect restenosis has reduced in the DES era.

Likewise, the durability of CABG results have increased with the use
of arterial grafts, and ischaemia stems mainly from SVG attrition and/
or progression of CAD in native vessels. Nevertheless, the recurrence of symptoms or ischaemia due to disease progression or reste
nosis deserves attention.

19.1 Gaps in the evidence
In all studies to date on the optimal follow-up after PCI, the gain from
discovering patients with restenosis is obscured by the high rate
of false positive exercise ECG tests indicating ischaemia. Therefore,
simple exercise ECG testing is not recommended for follow-up and
a non-invasive imaging approach is preferred. Specific studies to
clarify which subset of patients benefits more from a specific followup approach are missing. More studies are needed to assess the role
of CT angiography in patient surveillance after myocardial

revascularization.
### 20 Key messages

(1) Myocardial revascularization is performed for the relief of symp
toms of myocardial ischaemia and the improvement of prognosis.

In SCAD, the prognostic benefit is dependent on the extent of

myocardium subject to ischaemia.

(2) The prognostic and symptomatic benefits of myocardial revascula
rization critically depend on the completeness of revascularization.

Therefore, the ability to achieve complete revascularization is a

key issue when choosing the appropriate treatment strategy.

(3) Apart from issues of individual operative risk and technical feasibil
ity, diabetes mellitus and the anatomical complexity of CAD deter
mine the relative benefits of PCI and CABG.

(4) The SYNTAX score is the recommended tool to gauge the ana
tomical complexity of coronary disease.

mine the relative benefits of PCI and CABG.

(4) The SYNTAX score is the recommended tool to gauge the ana
tomical complexity of coronary disease.


(5) In some instances, both PCI and CABG are equally reasonable, or

sometimes even equally problematic, options. This calls for the

Heart Team to be consulted to develop individualized treatment

concepts, with respect for the preferences of the patient who has

been informed about early and late outcomes.

(6) Timely PCI of the culprit lesion remains the mainstay of treatment

of ACS.

(7) After PCI of the culprit lesion in ACS, the choice of further revas
cularization modality should follow the criteria applied to patients

with SCAD.

(8) Radial access is preferred for any PCI irrespective of clinical pre
sentation, unless there are overriding procedural considerations.

(9) DES are recommended for any PCI irrespective of clinical presen
tation, lesion type, anticipated duration of DAPT, or concomitant

anticoagulant therapy.

(10) Even though 6 months of DAPT is generally recommended after

PCI in SCAD and 12 months of DAPT after ACS, the type and

duration of DAPT should be individualized according to the ischae
mic and bleeding risks, and appropriately adapted during follow
up. Based on this judgement, treatment durations for DAPT after

DES that are as short as 1 month or even as long as lifelong may be

reasonable.

(11) Off-pump surgery with no-touch aorta for high-risk patients

should be considered when expertise exists.

(12) Multiple arterial grafting should be considered using the radial

artery for high-grade stenosis and/or BIMA grafting for patients

who do not have an increased risk of sternal wound infection.
