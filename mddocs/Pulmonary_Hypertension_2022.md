### 1. Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence, with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines and
their recommendations should facilitate decision-making of health
professionals in their daily practice. However, guidelines are not a

’                        substitute for the patient s relationship with their practitioner. The fi
nal decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s), based on what they consider to be


the most appropriate in the circumstances. These decisions are
made in consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate.
Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals. To ensure that
all physicians have access to the most recent recommendations, both the
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Respiratory Society
(ERS) make their guidelines freely available in their own journals. The ESC
and ERS warn non-medical readers that the technical language may be
misinterpreted and decline any responsibility in this respect.
Many Guidelines have been issued in recent years by the ESC and
ERS. Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for
the development of guidelines have been established in order to
make all decisions transparent to the user. The ERS and ESC guidance and procedure to formulate and issue clinical practice recom
mendations can be found on the societies’ relevant website or

[journal (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines and https://openres.](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[ersjournals.com/content/8/1/00655-2021).](https://openres.ersjournals.com/content/8/1/00655-2021) The ESC and ERS
Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC and ERS on a given topic and are regularly updated.
The panel of experts of these specific guidelines comprised an
equal number of ERS and ESC members, including representatives
from relevant subspecialty groups involved in the medical care of patients with this pathology.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived
as real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations
of interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest
[rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[Guidelines). They have been compiled in a report and co-published in a](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
supplementary document of the guidelines. This process ensures
transparency and prevents potential biases in the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of interest that arose during the writing period were notified to the ESC and updated. The Task
Force received its entire financial support from the ESC and ERS without any involvement from the health care industry.
The ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) Committee and the ERS
Guidelines Director reporting to the ERS Science Council supervise
and co-ordinate the preparation of new guidelines. These Guidelines
underwent extensive review by the ESC CPG Committee, the ERS
Guidelines Working Group, and external experts. The guidelines
were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical
knowledge and the evidence available at the time of drafting. After appropriate revisions, the guidelines were signed off by all the experts in
the Task Force. The finalized document was signed off by the ESC CPG
Committee and endorsed by the ERS Executive Committee before
being simultaneously published in the European Heart Journal (EHJ)
and the European Respiratory Journal (ERJ). The decision to publish the
guidelines in both journals was made to ensure adequate dissemination
of the recommendations in both the cardiology and respiratory fields.
The task of developing the ESC/ERS Guidelines also included creating educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations, including condensed pocket guidelines versions, summary
slides, a lay summary, and an electronic version for digital applications
(smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus, for more
detailed information, the user should always access the full-text version
of the guidelines, which is freely available via the ESC and ERS websites,
and hosted on the EHJ and ERJ websites. The National Cardiac
Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, adopt, translate,

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3625


and implement all ESC Guidelines. Pulmonary national societies are
also encouraged to share these guidelines with their members and develop a summary or editorials in their own language, if appropriate.
Implementation programmes are needed because it has been shown
that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC/ERS Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well as in
determining and implementing preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic
medical strategies. However, the ESC/ERS Guidelines do not override,
in any way, the individual responsibility of health professionals to make
appropriate and accurate decisions in considering each patient’s health
condition and in consulting with that patient or the patient’s caregiver
where appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional’s
responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable to drugs and
devices at the time of prescription and, where appropriate, to respect
the ethical rules of their profession in each country.
Off-label use of medication may be presented in these guidelines if
a sufficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically appropriate to a given condition and if patients could benefit
from the recommended therapy. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health
professional, giving special consideration to:

- The specific situation of the patient. In this respect, it is specified
that, unless otherwise provided for by national regulations, off
label use of medication should be limited to situations where it

is in the patient’s interest to do so, with regards to the quality,
safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has been fully
informed and provided consent.

Country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental
drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which health professionals are subject, where applicable.
### 2. Introduction

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a pathophysiological disorder that
may involve multiple clinical conditions and may be associated with a
variety of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The complexity of
managing PH requires a multifaceted, holistic, and multidisciplinary approach, with active involvement of patients with PH in partnership
with clinicians. Streamlining the care of patients with PH in daily clinical
practice is a challenging but essential requirement for effectively managing PH. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in detecting and managing PH, and new evidence has been timeously integrated
in this fourth edition of the ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and
treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Reflecting the multidisciplinary
input into managing patients with PH and interpreting new evidence,
the Task Force included cardiologists and pneumologists, a thoracic
surgeon, methodologists, and patients. These comprehensive clinical
practice guidelines cover the whole spectrum of PH, with an emphasis
on diagnosing and treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and
chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).

2.1. What is new

One of the most important proposals from the 6th World
Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) was to reconsider


the haemodynamic definition of PH. [1] After careful evaluation, the
new definitions of PH have been endorsed and expanded in these
guidelines, including a revised cut-off level for pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and a definition of exercise PH.
The classification of PH has been updated, including repositioning
of vasoreactive patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and a revision of group 5 PH, including repositioning of
PH in lymphangioleiomyomatosis in group 3.
Concerning the diagnosis of PH, a new algorithm has been developed aiming at earlier detection of PH in the community. In addition,
expedited referral is recommended for high-risk or complex patients. Screening strategies are also proposed.
The risk-stratification table has been expanded to include additional
echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI)
prognostic indicators. The recommendations for initial drug therapies
have been simplified, building on this revised, three-strata, multiparametric risk model to replace functional classification. At follow-up, a
four-strata risk-assessment tool is now proposed based on refined
cut-off levels for World Health Organization functional class
(WHO-FC), 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), and N-terminal
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), categorizing patients as

– –
low, intermediate low, intermediate high, or high risk.
The PAH treatment algorithm has been modified, highlighting the importance of cardiopulmonary comorbidities, risk assessment both at
diagnosis and follow-up, and the importance of combination therapies.
Treatment strategies during follow-up have been based on the fourstrata model intended to facilitate more granular decision-making.
The recommendations for managing PH associated with left heart disease (PH-LHD) and lung disease have been updated, including a new
haemodynamic definition of severe PH in patients with lung disease.
In group 4 PH, the term chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) with or without PH has been introduced, acknowledging the presence of similar symptoms, perfusion defects, and
organized fibrotic obstructions in patients with or without PH at
rest. Interventional treatment by balloon pulmonary angioplasty
(BPA) in combination with medical therapy has been upgraded in
the therapeutic algorithm of CTEPH.
New standards for PH centres have been presented and, for the
first time, patient representatives were actively involved in developing these guidelines.
Questions with direct consequences for clinical practitioners regarding each PH classification subgroup were selected and addressed, namely guidance on: initial treatment strategy for group 1 PH (Population,
Intervention, Control, Outcome [PICO] I); use of oral phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5is) for the treatment of group 2 PH (PICO II); use
of oral PDE5is for the treatment of group 3 PH (PICO III); and use of PH
drugs prior to BPA for the treatment of group 4 PH (PICO IV). These
questions were considered to be important because: most contemporary PH registries describe variable use of initial oral monotherapy and
combination therapy; large case series show widespread use of
PDE5is in group 2 PH, despite a class III recommendation in the 2015
ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary
hypertension; large case series show widespread use of PDE5is in group
3 PH, despite a class III recommendation in the 2015 ESC/ERS
Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension;
and there is no clear guidance for therapy with PH drugs in patients with
inoperable CTEPH prior to BPA.

2.2. Methods

Three main methodological approaches were used in these
guidelines, depending on the type of questions addressed:

(i) Four questions that were considered highly important were formulated in the PICO format, and assessed with full systematic
reviews and application of the Grading of Recommendations,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach [2] and the Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework [3] (see
Supplementary [Data,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data) Section 2.1 for full methodology

description and supportive material). The resulting recommendations were rated as strong or conditional, based on four potential levels of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low;
Tables 1 and 2). All Task Force members approved the recommendations. In addition, these recommendations were also presented and voted following the usual ESC approach.
(ii) Eight questions that were considered of key importance (key
narrative questions) were assessed with systematic literature
searches and application of the EtD framework. [6] The evidence grading was performed following the usual ESC
approach.
(iii) The remaining topics of interest were assessed using the process
commonly followed in ESC Guidelines. Structured literature
searches were undertaken and grading tables, as outlined in
Tables 3 and 4, were created to describe level of confidence in

### 3. Definitions and classifications

3.1. Definitions
The definitions for PH are based on haemodynamic assessment by
right heart catheterization (RHC). Although haemodynamics represent the central element of characterizing PH, the final diagnosis
and classification should reflect the whole clinical context and consider the results of all investigations.

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3637


Pulmonary hypertension is defined by a mean pulmonary arterial
pressure (mPAP) .20 mmHg at rest (Table 5). This is supported
by studies assessing the upper limit of normal pulmonary arterial
pressure (PAP) in healthy subjects, [7][–][9] and by studies investigating
the prognostic relevance of increased PAP (key narrative question
[1, Supplementary Data, Section 3.1).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data) [10][–][12]

It is essential to include PVR and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP) in the definition of pre-capillary PH, in order to discriminate elevated PAP due to pulmonary vascular disease (PVD)
from that due to left heart disease (LHD), elevated pulmonary blood
flow, or increased intrathoracic pressure (Table 5). Based on the
available data, the upper limit of normal PVR and the lowest prognostically relevant threshold of PVR is ≏2 Wood units (WU). [7][,][8][,][13][,][14]

Pulmonary vascular resistance depends on body surface area and
age, with elderly healthy subjects having higher values. The available
data on the best threshold for PAWP discriminating pre- and postcapillary PH are contradictory. Although the upper limit of normal
PAWP is considered to be 12 mmHg, [15] previous ESC/ERS
Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH, as well as the re
cent consensus recommendation of the ESC Heart Failure
Association, [16] suggest a higher threshold for the invasive diagnosis
of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)
(PAWP ≥15 mmHg). In addition, almost all therapeutic studies of
PAH have used the PAWP ≤15 mmHg threshold. Therefore, it is recommended keeping PAWP ≤15 mmHg as the threshold for precapillary PH, while acknowledging that any PAWP threshold is arbitrary and that the patient phenotype, risk factors, and echocardiographic findings, including left atrial (LA) volume, need to be
considered when distinguishing pre- from post-capillary PH.
Patients with PAH are haemodynamically characterized by precapillary PH in the absence of other causes of pre-capillary PH,
such as CTEPH and PH associated with lung diseases. All PH groups

may comprise both pre- and post-capillary components contributing
to PAP elevation. In particular, older patients may present with several conditions predisposing them to PH. The primary classification
should be based on the presumed predominant cause of the pulmon
ary pressure increase.
Post-capillary PH is haemodynamically defined as mPAP
.20 mmHg and PAWP .15 mmHg. Pulmonary vascular resistance
is used to differentiate between patients with post-capillary PH who
have a significant pre-capillary component (PVR .2 WU—combined post- and pre-capillary PH [CpcPH]) and those who do not
(PVR ≤2 WU—isolated post-capillary PH [IpcPH]).
There are patients with elevated mPAP (.20 mmHg) but low
PVR (≤2 WU) and low PAWP (≤15 mmHg). These patients are frequently characterized by elevated pulmonary blood flow and, although they have PH, they do not fulfil the criteria of pre- or
post-capillary PH. This haemodynamic condition may be described
by the term ‘unclassified PH’. Patients with unclassified PH may present with congenital heart disease (CHD), liver disease, airway disease, lung disease, or hyperthyroidism explaining their mPAP
elevation. Clinical follow-up of these patients is generally recommended. In the case of elevated pulmonary blood flow, its aetiology
should be explored.
As the groups of PH according to clinical classification represent
different clinical conditions, there may be additional clinically relevant
haemodynamic thresholds (e.g. for PVR) for the individual PH groups
besides the general thresholds of the haemodynamic definition of
PH, which are discussed in the corresponding sections.
Exercise PH, defined by an mPAP/cardiac output (CO) slope
.3 mmHg/L/min between rest and exercise, [17] has been reintroduced. The mPAP/CO slope is strongly age dependent and its

–
upper limit of normal ranges from 1.6 3.3 mmHg/L/min in the supine
position. [17] An mPAP/CO slope .3 mmHg/L/min is not physiological
in subjects aged,60 years and may rarely be present in healthy subjects aged .60 years. [17] A pathological increase in pulmonary pressure during exercise is associated with impaired prognosis in
patients with exercise dyspnoea [18] and in several cardiovascular conditions. [19][–][22] Although an increased mPAP/CO slope defines an abnormal haemodynamic response to exercise, it does not allow for
differentiation between pre- and post-capillary causes. The PAWP/
CO slope with a threshold .2 mmHg/L/min may best differentiate
between pre- and post-capillary causes of exercise PH. [23][,][24]

3.2. Classifications
The basic structure of the classification from the 2015 ESC/ERS
Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH [25][,][26] and the
Proceedings of the 6th WSPH [1] has been kept (Table 6). The general
purpose of the clinical classification of PH remains to categorize clinical conditions associated with PH, based on similar pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical presentation, haemodynamic
characteristics, and therapeutic management (Figure 1). The main
changes are as follows:

(i) The subgroups ‘non-responders at vasoreactivity testing’ and
‘acute responders at vasoreactivity testing’ have been added
to IPAH as compared with the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for
the diagnosis and treatment of PH. [25][,][26] In addition to patients
with IPAH, some patients with heritable PAH (HPAH) or

arterial stenoses, and hydatidosis.

drug- or toxin-associated PAH (DPAH) might be acute
responders.
(ii) The groups ‘PAH with features of venous/capillary (pulmonary
veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis

[PVOD/PCH]) involvement’ and ‘persistent PH of the newborn (PPHN)’ have been included in group 1 (PAH) as compared with the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis
and treatment of PH and in line with the Proceedings of the
6th WSPH. [1]

(iii) Instead of the general term ‘sleep-disordered breathing’, the
term ‘hypoventilation syndromes’ should be used within group

3 to describe conditions with increased risk of PH. Sole noctur
nal obstructive sleep apnoea is generally not a cause of PH, but
PH is frequent in patients with hypoventilation syndromes causing daytime hypercapnia.
### 4. Epidemiology and risk factors

Pulmonary hypertension is a major global health issue. All age groups
are affected. Present estimates suggest a PH prevalence of ≏1% of
the global population. Due to the presence of cardiac and pulmonary
causes of PH, prevalence is higher in individuals aged .65 years. [29]

Globally, LHD is the leading cause of PH. [29] Lung disease, especially
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is the second
most common cause. [29] In the UK, the observed PH prevalence
has doubled in the last 10 years and is currently 125 cases/million inhabitants. [30] Irrespective of the underlying condition, developing PH
is associated with worsening symptoms and increased mortality. [29]

In developing countries, CHD, some infectious diseases (schistosomiasis, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]), and high altitude represent important but under-studied causes of PH. [29]

4.1. Group 1, pulmonary arterial
hypertension
Recent registry data from economically developed countries indicate
a PAH incidence and prevalence of ≏6 and 48–55 cases/million
adults, respectively. [31] It has been thought to predominantly affect
younger individuals, mostly females; [32][,][33] this is currently true for
HPAH, which affects twice as many females as males. However, recent data from the USA and Europe suggest that PAH is now frequently diagnosed in older patients (i.e. those aged ≥65 years,
who often present with cardiovascular comorbidities, resulting in a
more equal distribution between sexes). [32] In most PAH registries,

–
IPAH was the most common subtype (50 60% of all cases), followed
by PAH associated with connective tissue disease (CTD), CHD, and
portal hypertension (porto-pulmonary hypertension [PoPH]). [32]

A number of drugs and toxins are associated with the development of PAH. [1][,][34][–][45] The association between exposure to drugs
and toxins and PAH is classified as definite or possible, as proposed
at the 6th WSPH (Table 7). [1] There is a definite association with
drugs, with available data based on outbreaks, epidemiological casecontrol studies, or large multicentre series. A possible association is
suggested by multiple case series or cases with drugs with similar mechanisms of action. [1]

4.2. Group 2, pulmonary hypertension
associated with left heart disease

In 2013, the Global Burden of Disease Study reported 61.7 million
cases of HF worldwide, which represented almost a doubling since
1990. [46] In Europe and the USA, .80% of patients with HF are
aged ≥65 years. Post-capillary PH, either isolated or combined
with a pre-capillary component, is a frequent complication mainly
in HFpEF, affecting at least 50% of these patients. [47][,][48] The prevalence
of PH increases with severity of left-sided valvular diseases, and PH
can be found in 60–70% of patients with severe and symptomatic mitral valve disease [49] and in up to 50% of those with symptomatic aortic stenosis. [50]

4.3. Group 3, pulmonary hypertension
associated with lung diseases and/or
hypoxia
Mild PH is common in advanced parenchymal and interstitial lung disease. Studies have reported that ≏1–5% of patients with advanced
COPD with chronic respiratory failure or candidates for lung volume
reduction surgery or lung transplantation (LTx) have an mPAP .35–
40 mmHg. [51][,][52] In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, an mPAP
≥25 mmHg has been reported in 8–15% of patients upon initial

–
work-up, with greater prevalence in advanced (30 50%) and endstage (.60%) disease. [52] Hypoxia is a public health problem for the
estimated 120 million people living at altitudes .2500 m. Altitude
dwellers are at risk of developing PH and chronic mountain sickness.
However, it remains unclear to what extent PH and right HF are
public health problems in high-altitude communities; this should be
addressed with updated methodology and large-scale population
studies. [53]


4.4. Group 4, pulmonary hypertension
associated with chronic pulmonary
artery obstruction
The number of patients diagnosed with CTEPH is increasing, probably
due to a deeper understanding of the disease and more active screening
for this condition in patients who remain dyspnoeic after pulmonary
embolism (PE) or who have risk factors for developing CTEPH.
Registry data indicate a CTEPH incidence and prevalence of 2–6 and
26–38 cases/million adults, respectively. [31][,][54][,][55] Patients with chronic
thrombo-embolic pulmonary disease (CTEPD) without PH still represent a small proportion of the patients referred to CTEPH centres. [56]

4.5. Group 5, pulmonary hypertension
with unclear and/or multifactorial

mechanisms

Group 5 PH consists of a complex group of disorders that are associated with PH. [57] The cause is often multifactorial and can be secondary
to increased pre- and post-capillary pressure, as well as direct effects on
pulmonary vasculature. The incidence and prevalence of PH in most of
these disorders are unknown. However, high-quality registries have recently enabled estimation of PH prevalence in adult patients with sarcoidosis. [58][,][59] Studies suggest that PH can be common and its presence
is often associated with increased morbidity and mortality. [58][,][59]
### 5. Pulmonary hypertension diagnosis

5.1. Diagnosis
The diagnostic approach to PH is mainly focused on two tasks. The
primary goal is to raise early suspicion of PH and ensure fast-track
referral to PH centres in patients with a high likelihood of PAH,
CTEPH, or other forms of severe PH. The second objective is to
identify underlying diseases, especially LHD (group 2 PH) and lung
disease (group 3 PH), as well as comorbidities, to ensure proper classification, risk assessment, and treatment.

5.1.1. Clinical presentation
Symptoms of PH are mainly linked to right ventricle (RV) dysfunction, and typically associated with exercise in the earlier course of
the disease. [25][,][26] The cardinal symptom is dyspnoea on progressively
minor exertion. Other common symptoms are related to the stages
and severity of the disease, and are listed in Figure 2. [60][–][62] Potential
clinical signs and physical findings are summarized in Figure 3. [60][,][61]

Importantly, the physical examination may also be the key to identifying the underlying cause of PH (see Figure 3).

5.1.2. Electrocardiogram
Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (Table 8) may raise suspicion
of PH, deliver prognostic information, and detect arrhythmias and
signs of LHD. In adults with clinical suspicion of PH (e.g. unexplained
dyspnoea on exertion), right axis deviation has a high predictive value
for PH. [63] A normal ECG does not exclude the presence of PH, but a
normal ECG in combination with normal biomarkers (BNP/
NT-proBNP) is associated with a low likelihood of PH in patients referred for suspected PH or at risk of PH (i.e. after acute PE). [64][,][65]

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3641






Figure 2 Symptoms in patients with pulmonary hypertension. WHO-FC, World Health Organization functional class. [a] Thoracic compression syndromes are found in a minority of patients with PAH with pronounced dilation of the pulmonary artery, and may occur at any disease stage and
even in patients with otherwise mild functional impairment.


5.1.3. Chest radiography
Chest radiography presents abnormal findings in most patients with
PH; however, a normal chest X-ray does not exclude PH. [68]

Radiographic signs of PH include a characteristic configuration of
the cardiac silhouette due to right heart (right atrium [RA]/RV)
and PA enlargement, sometimes with pruning of the peripheral vessels. In addition, signs of the underlying cause of PH, such as LHD or
lung disease, may be found (Table 9). [25][,][26][,][60][,][69][,][70]

5.1.4. Pulmonary function tests and arterial blood

gases
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and analysis of arterial blood gas
(ABG) or arterialized capillary blood are necessary to distinguish between PH groups, assess comorbidities and the need for supplementary oxygen, and determine disease severity. The initial work-up of
patients with suspected PH should comprise forced spirometry,
body plethysmography, lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide
(DLCO), and ABG.


In patients with PAH, PFTs are usually normal or may show mild
restrictive, obstructive, or combined abnormalities. [71][,][72] More severe

PFT abnormalities are occasionally found in patients with PAH associated with CHD, [73] and those with group 3 PH. The DLCO may be
normal in patients with PAH, although it is usually mildly reduced. [71] A
severely reduced DLCO (,45% of the predicted value) in the pres
ence of otherwise normal PFTs can be found in PAH associated with

systemic sclerosis (SSc), PVOD, in PH group 3—associated with em
                                          physema, interstitial lung disease (ILD), or combined pulmonary fi
brosis and emphysema—and in some PAH phenotypes. [74] A low
DLCO is associated with a poor prognosis in several forms of
PH. [75][–][78]

Patients with PAH usually have normal or slightly reduced partial
pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ). Severe reduction of PaO 2 might
raise suspicion for patent foramen ovale, hepatic disease, other abnormalities with right-to-left shunt (e.g. septal defect), or

low-DLCO-associated conditions.

Partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) is typically
lower than normal due to alveolar hyperventilation. [79] Low PaCO 2

at diagnosis and follow-up is common in PAH and associated with
unfavourable outcomes. [80] Elevated PaCO 2 is very unusual in PAH
and reflects alveolar hypoventilation, which in itself may be a cause
of PH. Overnight oximetry or polysomnography should be performed if there is suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing or
hypoventilation. [81]

5.1.5. Echocardiography
Independent of the underlying aetiology, PH leads to RV pressure
overload and dysfunction, which can be detected by echocardiography. [82][–][84] When performed accurately, echocardiography provides
comprehensive information on right and left heart morphology, RV
and LV function, and valvular abnormalities, and gives estimates of
haemodynamic parameters. Echocardiography is also a valuable


tool with which to detect the cause of suspected or confirmed
PH, particularly with respect to PH associated with LHD or CHD.
Yet, echocardiography alone is insufficient to confirm a diagnosis
of PH, which requires RHC.
Given the heterogeneous nature of PH and the peculiar geometry of the RV, there is no single echocardiographic parameter
that reliably informs about PH status and underlying aetiology.
Therefore, a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation for suspected PH includes estimating the systolic pulmonary arterial
pressure (sPAP) and detecting additional signs suggestive of PH,
aiming at assigning an echocardiographic level of probability of
PH. Echocardiographic findings of PH, including estimating pressure and signs of RV overload and/or dysfunction, are summarized
in Figure 4.

Estimates of sPAP are based on the peak tricuspid regurgitation
velocity (TRV) and the TRV-derived tricuspid regurgitation pressure

— —
gradient (TRPG) after excluding pulmonary stenosis taking into
account non-invasive estimates of RA pressure (RAP). Considering
the inaccuracies in estimating RAP and the amplification of measurement errors by using derived variables, [85][–][87] these guidelines


recommend using the peak TRV (and not the estimated sPAP) as
the key variable for assigning the echocardiographic probability of
PH. A peak TRV .2.8 m/s may suggest PH; however, the presence
or absence of PH cannot be reliably determined by TRV alone. [88]

Lowering the TRV threshold in view of the revised haemodynamic
definition of PH is not supported by available data (key narrative
[question 2, Supplementary Data, Section 5.1).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data) [89][–][92] Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity may underestimate (e.g. in patients with severe
TR) [28] or overestimate (e.g. in patients with high CO in liver disease
or sickle cell disease [SCD], [93][,][94] misinterpretation of tricuspid valve
closure artefact for the TR jet, or incorrect assignment of a peak TRV
in the case of maximum velocity boundary artefacts) pressure gradients. Hence, additional variables related to RV morphology and function are used to define the echocardiographic probability of PH
(Table 10), [82][–][84][,][95] which may then be determined as low, intermediate, or high. When interpreted in a clinical context, this probability
can be used to decide the need for further investigation, including
cardiac catheterization in individual patients (Figure 5).
Echocardiographic measures of RV function include the tricuspid
annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV fractional area change
(RV-FAC), RV free-wall strain, and tricuspid annulus velocity (S [′]

wave) derived from tissue Doppler imaging, and potentially RV ejection fraction (RVEF) derived from 3D echocardiography.

—
Furthermore, the TAPSE/sPAP ratio representing a non-invasive
measure of RV–PA coupling [96] —may aid in diagnosing PH. [90][,][97][,][98]

The pattern of RV outflow tract (RVOT) blood flow (mid-systolic
‘notching’) may suggest pre-capillary PH. [99][,][100]

To separate between group 2 PH and other forms of PH, and to
assess the likelihood of left ventricle (LV) diastolic dysfunction, LA
size and signs of LV hypertrophy should always be measured, and
Doppler echocardiographic signs (e.g. E/A ratio, E/E [′] ) should be assessed even if the reliability of the latter is considered low. [16] To identify CHD, 2D Doppler and contrast examinations are helpful, but
transoesophageal contrast echocardiography or other imaging techniques (e.g. computer tomography [CT] angiography, cMRI) are
needed in some cases to detect or exclude sinus venosus atrial septal
defects, patent ductus arteriosus, and/or anomalous pulmonary venous return. [101] The clinical value of exercise Doppler echocardiography in identifying exercise PH remains uncertain because of the
lack of validated criteria and prospective confirmatory data. In
most cases, increases in sPAP during exercise are caused by diastolic
LV dysfunction. [16]

5.1.6. Ventilation/perfusion lung scan
A ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scan (planar or single-photon
emission computed tomography [SPECT]) is recommended in the
diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected or newly diagnosed
PH, to rule out or detect signs of CTEPH. [102][,][103] The V/Q SPECT
is superior to planar imaging and is the methodology of choice; however, SPECT has been widely evaluated in assessing PE, but not to the
same degree in CTEPH. [68] In the absence of parenchymal lung disease, a normal perfusion scan excludes CTEPH with a negative predicted value of 98%. [104][,][105] In most patients with PAH, V/Q
scintigraphy is normal or shows a speckled pattern but no typical
perfusion defects characteristic of PE or CTEPH, whereas matched
V/Q defects may be found in patients with lung disease (i.e. group
3 PH). Non-matched perfusion defects similar to those seen in

–
CTEPH may be present in 7 10% of patients with PVOD/PCH or
PAH. [106][,][107] Deposition of the perfusion agent in extrapulmonary organs may hint to cardiac or pulmonary right-to-left shunting and has
been reported in CHD, hepato-pulmonary syndrome, and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). [68]

5.1.7. Non-contrast and contrast-enhanced chest

computed tomography examinations, and digital
subtraction angiography
Computed tomography (CT) imaging may provide important information for patients with unexplained dyspnoea or suspected/confirmed PH. The CT signs suggesting the presence of PH include an
enlarged PA diameter, a PA-to-aorta ratio .0.9, and enlarged right
heart chambers. [68] A combination of three parameters (PA diameter
≥30 mm, RVOT wall thickness ≥6 mm, and septal deviation ≥140°

[or RV:LV ratio ≥1]) is highly predictive of PH. [108] Non-contrast
chest CT can help determine the cause of PH when there are


features of parenchymal lung disease, and may also point towards
the presence of PVOD/PCH by showing centrilobular ground-glass
opacities (which may also be found in PAH), septal lines, and
lymphadenopathy. [68]

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is mainly
used to detect direct or indirect signs of CTEPH, such as filling defects (including thrombus adhering to the vascular wall), webs or
bands in the PAs, PA retraction/dilatation, mosaic perfusion, and enlarged bronchial arteries. Importantly, the diagnostic accuracy of
CTPA for CTEPH is limited (at the patient level, sensitivity and specificity are 76% and 96%, respectively), [109] but was reported to be
higher when modern, high-quality multi-detector CT scanners
were used and when interpreted by experienced readers. [109][,][110]

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography may also be used
to detect other cardiovascular abnormalities, including intracardiac
shunts, abnormal pulmonary venous return, patent ductus arterio
sus, and PAVMs.

a Signs contributing to assessing the probability of PH in addition to TRV (see Figure 5).
Signs from at least two categories (A/B/C) must be present to alter the level of
echocardiographic probability of PH.


In patients presenting with a clinical picture of acute PE, chest CT
may be helpful in detecting signs of hitherto undetected CTEPH,
which may include the presence of the above CTEPH signs, and
RV hypertrophy as a sign for chronicity. [111][,][112] Detecting ‘acute on
chronic’ PE is important, as it may impact the management of patients with presumed acute PE.
Dual-energy CT (DECT) angiography and iodine subtraction mapping may provide additional diagnostic information by creating iodine
maps, [113] which reflect lung perfusion, thereby possibly increasing the
diagnostic accuracy for CTEPH. [114] Although increasingly used, the
diagnostic value of DECT in the work-up of patients with PH has

not been established.

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is mainly used to confirm
the diagnosis of CTEPH and to assess treatment options (i.e. operability or accessibility for BPA). Most centres use conventional
two- or three-planar DSA. However, C-arm CT imaging may provide a higher spatial resolution, potentially identifying more target
vessels for BPA and providing procedural guidance. [115][,][116]

5.1.8. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging accurately and reproducibly assesses atrial and ventricular size, morphology, and function.
Additional information on RV/LV myocardial strain can be obtained
by applying tagging or by post-processing feature tracking. In addition, cMRI can be used to measure blood flow in the PA, aorta,
and vena cava, allowing for quantifying stroke volume (SV),

risk factors or associated conditions for PAH or CTEPH (e.g. when mild PH and predominant LHD or lung disease are present).

intracardiac shunt, and retrograde flow. By combining contrast magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and pulmonary perfusion imaging
with late gadolinium-enhancement imaging of the myocardium, a
complete picture of the heart and pulmonary vasculature can be ob[tained (see Supplementary Data, Table S2 for cMRI indices and nor-](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
mal values). A limitation is that there is no established method with
which to estimate PAP. Even though the cost and availability of the
technique precludes its use in the early diagnosis of PAH, it is sensitive in detecting early signs of PH and diagnosing CHD. [117]

5.1.9. Blood tests and immunology
The initial diagnostic assessment of patients with newly diagnosed
PH/PAH aims to identify comorbidities and possible causes or complications of PH. Laboratory tests that should be obtained at the time
of PH diagnosis include: blood counts (including haemoglobin [Hb]);
serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium); kidney function (creatinine,
calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate, and urea); uric
acid; liver parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, bilirubin); iron status (serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin);
and BNP or NT-proBNP. In addition, serological studies should include testing for hepatitis viruses and HIV. Basic immunology laboratory work-up is recommended, including screening tests for

anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-centromere antibodies, and anti-Ro.

Screening for biological markers of antiphospholipid syndrome is recommended in patients with CTEPH. Additional thrombophilia
screening is not generally recommended, unless therapeutic consequences are to be expected. [118] Pulmonary arterial hypertension
and other forms of severe PH can be associated with thyroid function disorders; hence, laboratory screening should include at least
thyroid-stimulating hormone.

5.1.10. Abdominal ultrasound

An abdominal ultrasound examination should be part of the comprehensive diagnostic work-up of patients with newly diagnosed PH,
particularly if liver disease is suspected. A major objective is to search
for liver disease and/or portal hypertension, or portocaval shunt
(Abernethy malformation). During the course of the disease, patients with PH may develop secondary organ dysfunction mainly affecting the liver and kidneys. [119] In these patients, abdominal
ultrasound is needed for differential diagnostic reasons and to assess
the extent of organ damage.

5.1.11. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a useful tool to assess
the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to exercise intolerance. Patients with PAH show a typical pattern, with a low endtidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P ET CO 2 ), high ventilatory
equivalent for carbon dioxide (VE/VCO 2 ), low oxygen pulse (VO 2 /
HR), and low peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 ). [120] These findings should
prompt consideration of PVD. In patients with LHD or COPD,
such a pattern may indicate an additional pulmonary vascular limitation. [121][,][122] In populations at risk of PAH, such as those with SSc, a
normal peak VO 2 seems to exclude the diagnosis of PAH. [123]


5.1.12. Right heart catheterization, vasoreactivity,
exercise, and fluid challenge
5.1.12.1. Right heart catheterization
Right heart catheterization is the gold standard for diagnosing and
classifying PH. Performing RHC requires expertise and meticulous
methodology following standardized protocols. In addition to diagnosing and classifying PH, clinical indications include haemodynamic
assessment of heart or LTx candidates [124] and evaluating congenital
cardiac shunts. Interpreting invasive haemodynamics should be
done in the context of the clinical picture and other diagnostic investigations. When performed in PH centres, the frequencies of serious
adverse events (1.1%) and procedure-related mortality (0.055%) are
low. [125] A known thrombus or tumour in the RV or RA, recently implanted (,1 month) pacemaker, mechanical right heart valve,
TriClip, and an acute infection are contraindications to RHC; the
risk:benefit ratio should be individually assessed before each examination and discussed with the patient. The most feared complication
of RHC is perforation of a PA.
The adequate preparation of patients for RHC is of major relevance. Pre-existing medical conditions should be optimally controlled
at the time of the examination (particularly blood pressure and volume control). In the supine position, the mid-thoracic level is recom
mended as the zero reference level, which is at the level of the LA in
most patients. [126]

For a complete assessment of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics,

all measures listed in Table 11 must be measured or calculated.

right heart catheterization

|Right atrial pressure, mean (RAP)|2–6 mmHg|

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3647


Incomplete assessments must be avoided, as this may lead to misdiagnosis. As a minimum, mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2 )
and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) should be determined. A stepwise assessment of oxygen saturation should be performed in patients with SvO 2 .75% and whenever a left-to-right shunt is
suspected. Cardiac output (CO) should be assessed by the direct
Fick method or thermodilution (mean values of at least three measurements). The indirect Fick method is considered to be less reliable
than thermodilution; [127] however, thermodilution should not be used

in the presence of shunts. Pulmonary vascular resistance

−
([mPAP PAWP]/CO) should be calculated for each patient. All
pressure measurements, including PAWP, should be performed at
end expiration (without breath-holding manoeuvre). In patients
with large intrathoracic pressure changes during the respiratory cycle (i.e. COPD, obesity, during exercise), it is appropriate to average
over at least three to four respiratory cycles. If no reliable PAWP
curve can be obtained, or if the PAWP values are implausible, additional measurement of LV end-diastolic pressure should be considered to avoid misclassification. Saturations taken with the catheter in
the wedged position can confirm an accurate PAWP. [128]

5.1.12.2. Vasoreactivity testing
The purpose of vasoreactivity testing in PAH is to identify acute vasoresponders who may be candidates for treatment with high-dose calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Pulmonary vasoreactivity testing is
only recommended in patients with IPAH, HPAH, or DPAH.
Inhaled nitric oxide [129] or inhaled iloprost [130][,][131] are the recommended
test compounds for vasoreactivity testing (Table 12). There is similar
evidence for intravenous (i.v.) epoprostenol, but due to incremental
dose increases and repetitive measurements, testing takes much longer and is therefore less feasible. [129] Adenosine i.v. is no longer recommended due to frequent side effects. [132] A positive acute response is
defined as a reduction in mPAP by ≥10 mmHg to reach an absolute
value ≤40 mmHg, with increased or unchanged CO. [129] In patients
with PH-LHD, vasoreactivity testing is restricted to evaluating heart
transplantation candidacy (see Section 8.1), and in patients with PH
in the context of CHD with initial systemic-to-pulmonary shunting, vasoreactivity testing can be performed to evaluate the possibility of defect closure (see Section 7.5). [101]

5.1.12.3. Exercise right heart catheterization
Right heart catheterization is the gold standard method to assess cardiopulmonary haemodynamics during exercise and to define


exercise PH. [133] The main reason to perform exercise RHC is to investigate patients with unexplained dyspnoea and normal resting
haemodynamics in order to detect early PVD or left heart dysfunction. In addition, exercise haemodynamics may reveal important
prognostic and functional information in patients at risk of PAH
and CTEPH. [22][,][134][,][135] To maximize the amount of information, exer
cise RHC may be combined with CPET. According to the available
data and experience, exercise RHC is not associated with an additional risk of complications compared with resting RHC and
CPET. [133]

Incremental exercise tests (step or ramp protocol) with repeated
haemodynamic measurements provide the most clinical information
on pulmonary circulation. The minimally required haemodynamic

variables measured at each exercise level include mPAP, sPAP, dia
stolic PAP (dPAP), PAWP, CO, heart rate, and systemic blood pressure. In addition, RAP, SvO 2, and SaO 2 should at least be measured at

rest and peak exercise. Total pulmonary resistance (TPR), PVR, and
cardiac index (CI) should be calculated at each exercise level, as well
as arteriovenous difference in oxygen at peak exercise. The mPAP/
CO and PAWP/CO slopes should also be calculated. [136][,][137] In patients with early PVD, PVR may be normal or mildly elevated at
rest, but may change during exercise with a steep increase in
mPAP, reflected by an mPAP/CO slope .3 mmHg/L/min, while
the PAWP/CO slope usually remains,2 mmHg/L/min. Patients
with left heart dysfunction, such as those with HFpEF [23] and/or dynamic mitral regurgitation, [138] and a normal PAWP at rest, usually
show a steep increase in mPAP and PAWP (and mPAP/CO,
PAWP/CO slope) during exercise.
According to recent studies, a PAWP/CO slope .2 mmHg/L/min
may be helpful in recognizing an abnormal PAWP increase and,
therefore, a cardiac exercise limitation, especially in patients with
PAWP 12–15 mmHg at rest. [23][,][24][,][139] A PAWP cut-off of
.25 mmHg during supine exercise has been recommended for diagnosing HFpEF. [16] In patients with lung disease, increased intrathoracic
pressure may contribute to mPAP elevation; this is exaggerated during exercise and can be recognized by a concomitant increase in
RAP. [140] Some exercise haemodynamics are age dependent, with
healthy elderly subjects presenting with steeper mPAP/CO and
PAWP/CO slopes than healthy young individuals. [9][,][141]

5.1.12.4. Fluid challenge
Fluid challenge may reveal LV diastolic dysfunction in patients with
PAWP ≤15 mmHg, but a clinical phenotype suggestive of LHD.

Most available data are derived from studies aiming to uncover
HFpEF (increase in PAWP) rather than identify group 2 PH (increase
in PAP; see Section 8.1). It is generally accepted that rapid infusion
(over 5–10 min) of ≏500 mL (7–10 mL/kg) of saline would be sufficient to detect an abnormal increase in PAWP to ≥18 mmHg (suggestive of HFpEF), [142] although validation and long-term evaluation of
these data are needed. [143] There are insufficient data on the haemodynamic response to fluid challenge in patients with PAH. Recent
data suggest that passive leg raise during RHC may also help to uncover occult HFpEF. [144]

5.1.13. Genetic counselling and testing
Mutations in PAH genes have been identified in familial PAH, IPAH,
PVOD/PCH, and anorexigen-associated PAH (Table 13). [148] The


screening recommendations herein specifically relate to patients
with an a priori diagnosis of PAH and not ‘at-risk’ populations being
screened for PAH (see Section 5.3). All patients with these conditions
should be informed about the possibility of a genetic condition and
that family members could carry a mutation that increases the risk
of PAH, allowing for screening and early diagnosis. [33][,][148] Even if genetic testing is not performed, family members should be made aware
of early signs and symptoms, to ensure that a timely and appropriate
diagnosis is made. [148]

Genetic counselling by appropriately trained PAH providers or geneticists should be performed prior to genetic testing, to address the
complex questions related to penetrance, genetically at-risk family
members, reproduction, genetic discrimination, and psychosocial issues. Careful genetic counselling with genetic counsellors or medical
geneticists is critical prior to genetic testing for asymptomatic family
members. [148]

If the familial mutation is known and an unaffected family member
tests negative for that mutation, the risk of PAH for that person is the
same as for the general population. [148]

Many of the less common mutations outlined have a potential additional set of syndromic features. These are summarized in Table 13
where specific clinical history, examination, and investigations are
suggested. In particular, clinicians should undertake a thorough history and examination, as syndromic PAH diagnoses may be missed
if not interrogated. For example, in one of the largest studies to
date, TBX4, ALK1, and ENG mutations were represented in the top
six most common genetic findings in adults with previously diagnosed
IPAH. [149] These findings have been confirmed and extended in international genetics consortia in 4241 patients with PAH. [150] It is therefore apparent that there is either phenotypic heterogeneity of these
syndromes or missed diagnostic features. As more genes associated
with PAH are discovered, it will become increasingly difficult to individually test for each. Next-generation sequencing has enabled the
development of gene panels to simultaneously interrogate several
genes. [151] It is, however, important to check the genes included in
the panel at the time of testing, since the composition changes as
genetic discoveries advance.

5.2. Diagnostic algorithm
A multistep, pragmatic approach to diagnosis should be considered
in patients with unexplained dyspnoea or symptoms/signs raising suspicion of PH. This strategy is depicted in detail in Figure 6 and
Table 14. The diagnostic algorithm does not address screening for
specific groups at risk of PH.

5.2.1 Step 1 (suspicion)
Patients with PH are likely to be seen by first-line physicians, mainly
general practitioners, for non-specific symptoms. Initial evaluation
should include a comprehensive medical (including familial) history,
thorough physical examination (including measurement of blood
pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry), blood test to determine
BNP/NT-proBNP, and resting ECG. This first step may raise a suspicion of a cardiac or respiratory disorder causing the symptoms.

5.2.2. Step 2 (detection)
The second step includes classical, non-invasive lung and cardiac testing. Among those tests, echocardiography is an important step in the

PH, irrespective of the cause. In addition, it is an important step in
identifying other cardiac disorders. Based on this initial assessment,
if causes other than PH are identified and/or in case of low probability of PH, patients should be managed accordingly.

5.2.3. Step 3 (confirmation)

Patients should be referred to a PH centre for further evaluation in

the following situations: (1) when an intermediate/high probability of


PH is established; (2) in the presence of risk factors for PAH, or a history of PE. A comprehensive work-up should be performed, with the
goal of establishing the differential diagnoses and distinguishing between the various causes of PH according to the current clinical classification. The PH centre is responsible for performing an invasive
assessment according to the clinical scenario.
At any time, warning signs must be recognized, as they are asso
ciated with worse outcomes and warrant immediate intervention.

Such warning signs include: rapidly evolving or severe symptoms

immediate assessment.

This diagnostic process emphasizes the importance of sufficient

and PH centres. Effective and rapid collaboration between each partner permits earlier diagnosis and management, and improves

5.3. Screening and early detection
Despite the advent of PAH therapies that prevent clinical worsening [166][–][168] and effective interventions for CTEPH, [102] the time from
symptom onset to PH diagnosis remains at .2 years, [169][,][170] with
most patients presenting with advanced disease. Decreasing the
time to diagnosis may reduce emotional uncertainty in patients, [171]

reduce the use of health care resources, and enable treatment at
an earlier stage when therapies may be more effective. [172]

A proposed multifaceted approach [172] to facilitate an earlier diagnosis includes: (1) screening asymptomatic, high-risk groups (with

high prevalence or where the diagnosis significantly impacts the pro
–
posed intervention), including individuals with SSc (prevalence: 5
19%), [173][,][174] BMPR2 mutation carriers (14–42%), [33] first-degree relatives of patients with HPAH, [148] and patients undergoing assessment

–
for liver transplantation (2 9%); [175] (2) early detection of symptomatic patients in at-risk groups with conditions such as portal hypertension, [176] HIV infection (0.5%), [177] and non-SSc CTD, where the lower
prevalence rates do not support asymptomatic screening; and (3) applying population-based strategies by deploying early detection approaches in PE follow-up clinics, [178][,][179] breathlessness clinics, [172] or
in at-risk patients identified from their health care behaviour and/
or previous investigations. [180]

Screening can be defined as the systematic application of a test or
tests to identify at-risk, asymptomatic individuals. Screening approaches can also be extended to individuals who would not otherwise have sought medical attention on account of their symptoms, to
facilitate early detection. Tools used to screen for PH have primarily
been assessed, but not exclusively, in SSc, [172][,][174] and include blood
biomarkers (NT-proBNP), ECG, echocardiography (primarily using
estimates of sPAP at rest, but also exercise studies), [182] PFTs
(DLCO and forced vital capacity [FVC]/DLCO ratio), and exercise
testing including CPET (which has been used in combination with
screening algorithms to reduce the need for RHC). [123][,][163]

5.3.1. Systemic sclerosis
In SSc, the prevalence of PAH is 5–19%, [174] with an annual incidence
of developing PAH of 0.7–1.5%. [183][–][185] Evidence for the clinical value
of detecting PAH early in SSc was provided by a screening programme, [186] which showed less severe haemodynamic impairment
and better survival in screened patients compared with a contemporaneous, non-screened cohort, [187] providing a strong rationale
for screening for PAH in patients with SSc.
The diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography or other tests alone in
detecting PAH is suboptimal. [173] Several screening algorithms have been
studied using a combination of clinicalfeatures, echocardiography, PFTs,
and NT-proBNP to select patients with SSc for RHC (DETECT; [173]

Australian Scleroderma Interest Group [ASIG] [188] ). Such combined approaches have improved diagnostic accuracy compared with the use of
echocardiography, NT-proBNP, or PFTs alone, and are able to prevent

–
unnecessary RHC and identify patients with mPAP 21 24 mmHg. [189]

Therefore, a multimodal approach is warranted when screening patients with SSc for PAH; the echocardiographic assessment should follow the strategy described in Section 5.1.5.
Beyond initial screening, the frequency with which screening
should be undertaken in asymptomatic subjects with SSc is unclear.
A study from the Australian Scleroderma Study Cohort, where annual screening was recommended (some patients were screened
up to 10 times), noted that most patients were diagnosed with
PAH at their first screening; however, those diagnosed on subsequent screening had a lower mPAP, PVR, and WHO-FC, and better
survival than those diagnosed at first screening. [190] Based on current
evidence, annual screening for PAH in patients with SSc is sufficient.
Given the financial and emotional cost associated with regular
screening, stratifying subjects with SSc into those at highest and lowest risk of PAH would be desirable. Risk factors for PAH include: (1)
clinical and demographic factors (i.e. breathlessness, longer disease
duration, sicca symptoms, digital ulceration, older age, and male


sex); and (2) the results of investigations (e.g. positive
anti-centromere antibody profile, mild ILD, low DLCO, elevated
FVC/DLCO ratio, or elevated NT-proBNP). [174][,][191] A recent
meta-analysis showed that reduced digital capillary density, as assessed by video-capillaroscopy, or progression to a severe active/
late pattern of vascular involvement is also a risk factor for
PAH. [192] In addition to identifying patients at increased risk of PAH,
a simple prediction model integrating symptoms, DLCO, and
NT-proBNP identified subjects at very low probability of PAH
who could potentially avoid further specific testing for PH. [183]

Furthermore, CPET may help to identify patients with SSc with a
low risk of having PAH and thus to avoid unnecessary RHC. [123]

The recommendations on screening for PAH in SSc have been es[tablished based on key narrative question 3 (Supplementary Data,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
Section 5.2).

5.3.2. BMPR2 mutation carriers

In the evolving list of genes known to be associated with PAH, experience is largely restricted to BMPR2 mutation carriers who carry a lifetime risk of developing PAH of ≏20%, with penetrance higher in female
carriers (42%) compared with male carriers (14%). [33][,][148][,][193] There is
currently no accepted screening strategy for evaluating PAH in
BMPR2 mutation carriers. At present, based on expert consensus,
asymptomatic relatives who screen positive for PAH-causing mutations
are often offered yearly screening echocardiography. [25][,][26] The
DELPHI-2 study, which prospectively screened carriers and relatives,
recently demonstrated a 9.1% pick up over 47 + 27 months of
PAH, with 2/55 diagnosed at baseline and 3/55 at follow-up; this
equates to an incidence of 2.3%/year. [33] The screening schedule included ECG, NT-proBNP, DLCO, echocardiography, CPET, and optional RHC; however, none of the cases would have been picked up
by echocardiography alone. Screening programmes should adopt a
multimodal approach, although the optimal strategy and screening period remains undefined and will require multinational, multicentre study.

5.3.3. Portal hypertension
An estimated 1–2% of patients with liver disease and portal hypertension develop PoPH, [176][,][194] which is of particular relevance in patients
considered for transjugular portosystemic shunting or liver transplantation. In such patients, echocardiography is recommended to screen
for PAH, even in the absence of symptoms. By using echocardiography,
sPAP can be measured in ≏80% of patients with portal hypertension,
which aids decisions to perform RHC. In patients assessed for liver
transplantation, one study showed that an sPAP of .50 mmHg had
97% sensitivity and 77% specificity for detecting moderate-to-severe
PAH. [195] Other investigators have recommended RHC when sPAP is
.38 mmHg. [196] When screening for PoPH, it is advised to assess the
echocardiographic probability of PH (see Section 5.1.5). In agreement
with the International Liver Transplant Society, for patients awaiting liver transplantation, it is recommended to reassess for PAH annually,
although the optimal interval remains unclear. [175]

5.3.4. Pulmonary embolism
Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension is an uncommon
and under-diagnosed complication of acute PE. [112] The reported cumulative incidence of CTEPH after acute, symptomatic PE ranges
0.1–11.8%, depending on the collective investigated. [112][,][178][,][197][–][199] A

3654 ESC/ERS Guidelines


systematic review and meta-analysis reported a CTEPH incidence of
0.6% in all patients with acute PE, 3.2% in survivors, and 2.8% in
survivors without major comorbidities. [178] A multicentre, observational, screening study reported a CTEPH incidence of 3.7/1000
patient-years and a 2 year cumulative incidence of 0.79% following
acute PE. [200] A recent prospective observational study (FOCUS,
Follow-up After Acute Pulmonary Embolism) showed a cumulative
2 year incidence of 2.3% and 16.0% for CTEPH and post-PE impairment, respectively, which were both associated with a higher risk of
rehospitalization and death. [201] Due to insufficient awareness, some
patients may have a delayed diagnosis of CTEPH because they may
initially be misclassified as acute PE. [112] In this context, the current
guidelines do not recommend routine follow-up of patients with PE
by imaging methods of the pulmonary vascular tree, but suggest evaluating the index imaging test used to diagnose acute PE for signs of
CTEPH. Echocardiography is the preferred first-line diagnostic test
in patients with suspected CTEPH. [103]

Up to 50% of patients have persistent perfusion defects after an
acute PE; however, the clinical relevance is unclear. [202][–][204] All patients
in whom symptoms can be attributed to post-thrombotic deposits
within PAs are considered to have CTEPD, with or without PH. [54]

While persistent dyspnoea is common after acute PE, [205] the prevalence of CTEPD without PH is unknown and requires further study
(see Section 10.1). A study exploring screening for CTEPH following
acute PE identified, using echocardiography, a low yield of additional
CTEPH diagnoses in asymptomatic patients. [206] Current PE guidelines recommend that further diagnostic evaluation may be considered in asymptomatic patients with risk factors for CTEPH at 3–6
months’ follow-up. [103][,][207] Approaches to early detection of CTEPH
following acute PE are based on identifying patients at increased
risk. [208] In patients with persistent or new-onset dyspnoea after PE,
non-invasive approaches use echocardiography to assess for PH
and cross-sectional imaging to assess for persistent perfusion defects.
Limited data exist on strategies using DECT, CT lung subtraction iodine mapping, or 3D MR perfusion imaging. Scoring systems, including
the Leiden CTEPH rule-out criteria [206][,][209] can be used to inform diagnostic strategies. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing may identify
characteristic features of exercise limitation due to PVD, or suggest
an alternative diagnosis. The optimal timing for assessing symptoms
to aid early detection of CTEPH may be 3–6 months after acute
PE, coinciding with the routine evaluation of anticoagulant treatment,
but earlier assessment may be necessary in highly symptomatic or
deteriorating patients. [54][,][103]

### 6. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1)

6.1. Clinical characteristics

The symptoms of PAH are non-specific and mainly related to progressive RV dysfunction (see Section 5.1.1) as a consequence of progressive pulmonary vasculopathy (Figure 7). The presentation of PAH
may be modified by diseases that are associated with PAH, as well as
comorbidities. More detailed descriptions of the individual PAH subsets are reported in Section 7.


6.2. Severity and risk assessment
6.2.1. Clinical parameters
Clinical assessment is a key part of evaluating patients with PAH, as it
provides valuable information for determining disease severity, improvement, deterioration, or stability. At follow-up, changes in
WHO-FC (Table 15), episodes of chest pain, arrhythmias, haemoptysis, syncope, and signs of right HF provide important information.
Physical examination should assess heart rate, rhythm, blood pressure, cyanosis, enlarged jugular veins, oedema, ascites, and pleural effusions. The WHO-FC is one of the strongest predictors of survival,

both at diagnosis and follow-up, [210][–][212] and worsening WHO-FC is
one of the most alarming indicators of disease progression, which
should trigger further investigations to identify the cause(s) of clinical
deterioration. [210][,][213][,][214]

6.2.2. Imaging
Imaging of the heart plays an essential role in the follow-up of patients with PAH. Several echocardiographic and cMRI parameters
have been proposed to monitor RV function during the course of
[PAH. Table S2 provides a list of imaging parameters and relative cut-](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)

off values associated with increased and decreased risk of adverse

events.

6.2.2.1. Echocardiography
Echocardiography is a widely available imaging modality and is readily
performed at the patient’s bedside. It is crucial that a high-quality
echocardiographic assessment by PH specialists is undertaken to reduce intraobserver and interobserver variability. Of note, estimated
sPAP at rest is not prognostic and irrelevant to therapeutic decisionmaking. [212][,][215][,][216] An increase in sPAP does not necessarily reflect
disease progression and a decrease in sPAP does not necessarily reflect improvement.
Despite the complex geometry of the right heart, echocardiographic surrogates of the true right heart dimensions, which include a description of RV and RA areas, and the LV eccentricity
index, provide useful clinical information in PAH. [217][,][218] Right ventricular dysfunction can be evaluated measuring fractional area
change, TAPSE, tissue Doppler, and 2D speckle tracking myocardial strain recording of RV free-wall motion, all of which represent
isovolumetric and ejection-phase indices of load-induced RV


pump failure. [219][–][224] The rationale for the reported measurements is strong, as RV systolic function metrics assess the adaptation of RV contractility to increased afterload, and increased
right heart dimension and inferior vena cava dilation reflect
failure of this mechanism, hence maladaptation. [225] Pericardial
effusion and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) grading further explore
RV overload and are of prognostic relevance in these patients. [218][,][226][–][228] All of these variables are physiologically interdependent and their combination provides additional
prognostic information over single measurements. [223]

Echocardiography also enables combined parameters to be mea
–
sured, such as the TAPSE/sPAP ratio, which is tightly linked to RV
PA coupling and predicts outcome. [96][,][97] Echocardiographic measurements of RV and RA sizes combined with LV eccentricity index are
crucial for assessing RV reverse remodelling as an emerging marker
of treatment efficacy. [220][,][229] Three-dimensional echocardiography
may achieve better estimation than standard 2D assessment, but underestimations of volumes and ejection fraction have been reported,
and technical issues are, as yet, unresolved. [230]

6.2.2.2. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
The role of cMRI in evaluating patients with PAH has been addressed
in several studies, and RV volumes, RVEF, and SV are essential prognostic determinants in PAH. [225][,][231][–][236] In patients with PAH, initial
cMRI measurements added prognostic value to current risk
scores. [231][,][232] In addition, risk assessment at 1 year of follow-up based
on cMRI was at least equal to risk assessment based on RHC. [237] The

cMRI risk-assessment variables based on the current literature are included in Table 16. [117][,][225][,][231][–][235][,][237] The stroke volume index (SVI)
cut-off levels are based on the consensus of the literature; [238] a

−
change of 10 mL in SV (LV end-diastolic volume LV end-systolic volume) during follow-up is considered clinically significant. [239] The value
of cMRI in the follow-up of patients has been shown in several stud
ies, and cMRI enables treatment effects to be monitored and treatment strategies adapted in time to prevent clinical failure. [240][–][242]

6.2.3. Haemodynamics
Cardiopulmonary haemodynamics assessed by RHC provide important prognostic information, both at the time of diagnosis and at
follow-up. [129][,][212][,][213][,][216][,][238][,][243][–][245][,][247][,][248] Currently available riskstratification tools include haemodynamic variables for prognostication: RAP and PVR in REVEAL risk scores, [213][,][249][,][250] and RAP, CI, and
SvO 2 in the ESC/ERS risk-stratification table. [25][,][26] The mPAP provides little prognostic information, except in acute vasodilator responders. [129] A recent study from France, which combined clinical
and haemodynamic parameters, found that WHO-FC, 6MWD,
RAP, and SVI (but not SV and SvO 2 ) were independent predictors
of outcome. [238]

To refine the risk-stratification table (Table 16), SVI criteria are
now added with the cut-off values of .38 mL/m [2] and,31 mL/m [2]

to determine low-risk and high-risk status, respectively. [238]

The optimal timing of follow-up RHC has not been determined.
While some centres regularly perform invasive follow-up assessments, others perform them as clinically indicated, and there is no
evidence that any of these strategies is associated with better outcomes (Table 17).

cMRI parameters adapted from Section 6.2.2.2.


6.2.4. Exercise capacity
The 6-minute walking test (6MWT) is the most widely used measure
of exercise capacity in PH centres. The 6MWT is easy to perform,
inexpensive, and widely accepted by patients, health professionals,
and medicines agencies as an important and validated variable in
PH. As with all PH assessments, 6MWT results must always be interpreted in the clinical context. The 6MWD is influenced by factors
such as sex, age, height, weight, comorbidities, need for oxygen,
learning curve, and motivation. Test results are usually given in absolute distance (metres) rather than the percentage of predicted values. Change in 6MWD is one of the most commonly used
parameters in PAH clinical trials as a primary endpoint, key secondary endpoint, or component of clinical worsening. [251] A recent investigation showed that the best absolute-threshold values for 1 year
mortality and 1 year survival, respectively, were 165 m and 440 m,
respectively. [252] Improvements in 6MWD have had less predictive


value than deterioration on key clinical outcomes (mortality and survival). [250][,][252][,][253] These results are consistent with observations from
clinical trials and registries; [254][,][255] however, there is no single threshold that would apply to all patients. [256] Some studies have also suggested that adding SaO 2 measured by pulse oximetry and heart rate
responses may improve prognostic relevance. [246][,][257] Hypoxaemia observed during the 6MWT is associated with worse survival, but these
findings still await confirmation in large multicentre studies.
The incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) is an alternative maximal test for assessing patients with PAH. The ISWT has a potential
advantage over the 6MWT in that it does not have a ceiling effect;
furthermore, it keeps the simplicity of a simple-to-perform field
test, in contrast to CPET. However, the ISWT experience in PAH
is currently limited. [258]

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a non-invasive method for assessing functional capacity and exercise limitation. It is usually

performed as a maximal exercise test, and is safe even in patients
with severe exercise limitation. [259][,][260] Most PH centres use an incre
mental ramp protocol, although the test has not yet been standardized for this patient population. Robust prognostic evidence for
peak VO 2 and VE/VCO 2 has been found in three studies, all powered
for multivariable analysis. [261][–][263] When associated with SVI, peak
VO 2 provided useful information to further stratify patients with
PAH at intermediate risk. [264] However, the added value of CPET

on top of common clinical and haemodynamic variables remains
largely unexplored.

6.2.5. Biochemical markers

Considerable efforts have been made to identify additional biomarkers of PVD, addressing prognosis, [265][–][272] diagnosis, and differentiation of PH subtypes, [270][,][273][–][276] as well as PAH treatment
response. [266] Emerging proteins related to PAH and vascular remodelling include bone morphogenetic proteins 9 and 10 and translationally controlled tumour protein. [270][,][277][,][278] Proteome-wide screening
in IPAH and HPAH identified a multimarker panel with prognostic
information in addition to the REVEAL risk score. [271] Another study
found that early development of SSc-associated PAH (PAH-SSc) was
predicted by high circulating levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 4 in
patients with SSc. [276] However, none of these biomarkers have
been introduced in clinical practice.
Thus, BNP and NT-proBNP remain the only biomarkers routinely
used in clinical practice at PH centres, correlating with myocardial
stress and providing prognostic information. [279] Brain natriuretic
peptide and NT-proBNP are not specific for PH, as they can be elevated in other forms of heart disease, exhibiting great variability. The
previously proposed cut-off levels of BNP (,50, 50–300, and


.300 ng/L) and NT-proBNP (,300, 300–1400, and .1400 ng/L)
for low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively, in the ESC/ERS
risk-assessment model at baseline and during follow-up are prognostic for long-term outcomes and can be used to predict response to
treatment. [266] Refined cut-off values for BNP (,50, 50–199, 200–
800, and .800 ng/L) and NT-pro-BNP (,300, 300–649, 650–
1100, and .1100 ng/L) for low, intermediate–low, intermediate–
high, and high risk, respectively, have recently been introduced as
part of a four-strata risk-assessment strategy (see Section 6.2.7). [280]

6.2.6. Patient-reported outcome measures
A patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) is a term for health
outcomes that are ‘self-reported’ by the patient. It is the patient’s experience of living with PH and its impact on them and their caregivers, including symptomatic, intellectual, psychosocial, spiritual,
and goal-orientated dimensions of the disease and its treatment.
Despite treatment advances improving survival, patients with PAH
present with a range of non-specific yet debilitating symptoms, which
affect health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). [281][,][282]

Patient-reported outcome measures remain an underused outcome measure. Tools validated in patients with PAH should be
used to assess HR-QoL [282][,][283] in individual patients. There has
been a reliance on generic PROMs, which have been studied in patients with PAH but may lack sensitivity to detect changes in
PAH. [284][,][285] To address this, a number of PH-specific HR-QoL instruments have been developed and validated (e.g. Cambridge
Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review [CAMPHOR], [286]

emPHasis-10, [282][,][287] Living with Pulmonary Hypertension, [288] and
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension-Symptoms and Impact

[PAH-SYMPACT]). [289] These disease-specific PROMs track

functional status, clinical deterioration, and prognosis in PAH, and are
more sensitive to the differences in the risk status than generic
PROMs. [290][,][291] In addition, HR-QoL scores provide independent
prognostic information. [287]

6.2.7. Comprehensive prognostic evaluation, risk
assessment, and treatment goals
In the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of
PH, risk assessment was based on a multiparametric approach using
a three-strata model to classify patients at low, intermediate, or high
risk of death. Originally, these strata were based on estimated 1 year
mortality rates of,5%, 5–10%, and .10%, respectively. [25][,][26] Since
then, registry data have shown that observed 1 year mortality rates
in the intermediate- and high-risk groups were sometimes higher
than predicted (i.e. up to 20% in the intermediate-risk group and
.20% in the high-risk group). These numbers have been updated accordingly in the revised three-strata risk model (Table 16). [292][–][294]

Several abbreviated approaches of the 2015 ESC/ERS riskstratification tool have been introduced and independently validated
using the Swedish Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Registry
(SPAHR), [292] the Comparative, Prospective Registry of Newly
Initiated Therapies for PH (COMPERA), [293] and the French PH
Registry (FPHR). [295] Other risk-stratification tools have been developed from the US REVEAL, including the REVEAL 2.0 risk score calculator, and an abridged version (REVEAL Lite 2). [249][,][296] In all these
studies, WHO-FC, 6MWD, and BNP/NT-proBNP emerged as the
variables with the highest predictive value.

The main limitation of the 2015 ESC/ERS three-strata,
risk-assessment tool is that 60–70% of the patients are classified as
intermediate risk. [292][–][295][,][297][–][303] An initial attempt to substratify the
intermediate-risk group has been proposed, using a modified mean
score in the SPAHR equation (with low–intermediate, 1.5–1.99
and high–intermediate, 2.0–2.49 as cut-offs), where the high–intermediate group was associated with worse survival. [302] There have
also been attempts to further improve risk stratification by exploring
the additional value of new biomarkers, [304] or by measuring RV structure and function by echocardiography and cMRI. [231][,][305][,][306] Other
strategies have included incorporating renal function [307] or combining 6MWD with TAPSE/sPAP ratio; [96][,][97] however, all of these strategies have to be further validated.
Two recent registry studies have evaluated a four-strata,
risk-assessment tool based on refined cut-off levels for WHO-FC,


6MWD, and NT-proBNP (Table 18). [280][,][308] Patients were categorized

– –
as low, intermediate low, intermediate high, or high risk. Together,
these studies included .4000 patients with PAH and showed that
the four-strata model performed at least as well as the three-strata
model in predicting mortality. The four-strata model predicted survival in patients with IPAH, HPAH, DPAH, and PAH associated
with CTD (including the SSc subgroup), and in patients with PoPH.

–
The observed 1-year mortality rates in the four risk strata were 0
3%, 2–7%, 9–19%, and .20%, respectively. Compared with the

three-strata model, the four-strata model was more sensitive to

changes in risk from baseline to follow-up, and these changes were
associated with changes in the long-term mortality risk. The main advantage of the four-strata model over the three-strata model is better
discrimination within the intermediate-risk group, which helps guide
therapeutic decision-making (see Section 6.3.4). For these reasons,
the four-strata model is included in the updated treatment algorithm
(see Figure 9). However, the three-strata model is maintained for initial assessment, which should be comprehensive and include echocardiographic and haemodynamic variables, for which cut-off values for
the four-strata model have yet to be established.
Several studies have identified WHO-FC, 6MWD, and BNP/
NT-proBNP as the strongest prognostic predictors. [293][,][295][,][296] With
the abbreviated risk-assessment tools, missing values become an important limitation. REVEAL Lite 2 provides accurate prediction when
one key variable (WHO-FC, 6MWD, or BNP/NT-proBNP) is unavailable, but is no longer accurate when two of these variables are
missing. [293][,][296] The original three-strata SPAHR/COMPERA risk
tool was developed with at least two variables available, while the
four-strata model was developed and validated in patients for

whom all three variables were available. It is therefore recommended

to use at least these three variables for risk stratification. However,
two components may be used when variables are missing, especially
when a functional criterion (WHO-FC or 6MWD) is combined with
BNP or NT-proBNP. [296]

Collectively, the available studies support a risk-based,
goal-orientated treatment approach in patients with PAH, where
achieving and/or maintaining a low-risk status is favourable and re[commended (key narrative question 4, Supplementary Data,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
[Section 6.1).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data) [298][,][300][,][303][,][309][,][310] For risk stratification at diagnosis, use
of the three-strata model is recommended taking into account as
many factors as possible (Table 16), with a strong emphasis on disease
type, WHO-FC, 6MWD, BNP/NT-proBNP, and haemodynamics.

3660 ESC/ERS Guidelines


At follow-up, the four-strata model (Table 18) is recommended
as a basic risk-stratification tool, but additional variables should
be considered as needed, especially right heart imaging and
haemodynamics. At any stage, individual factors such as age,
sex, disease type, comorbidities, and kidney function should also

be considered.

b Level of evidence.

6.3. Therapy
According to the revised haemodynamic definition, PAH may be diagnosed in patients with mPAP .20 mmHg and PVR .2 WU. Yet,
the efficacy of drugs approved for PAH has only been demonstrated
in patients with mPAP ≥25 mmHg and PVR .3 WU (see
[Supplementary Data, Table S1). No data are available for the efficacy](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
of drugs approved for PAH in patients whose mPAP is,25 mmHg
and whose PVR is,3 WU. Hence, for such patients, the efficacy of
drugs approved for PAH has not been established. The same is true
for patients with exercise PH, who, by definition, do not fulfil the
diagnostic criteria for PAH. Patients at high risk of developing


PAH, for instance patients with SSc or family members of patients

with HPAH, should be referred to a PH centre for individual

decision-making.

6.3.1. General measures

Managing patients with PAH requires a comprehensive treatment
strategy and multidisciplinary care. In addition to applying PAH drugs,
general measures and care in special situations represent integral
components of optimized patient care. In this context, the systemic
consequences of PH and right-sided HF, often contributing to disease burden, should be appropriately managed. [119]

6.3.1.1. Physical activity and supervised rehabilitation
The 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH
suggested that patients with PAH should be encouraged to be active
within symptom limits. [25][,][26] Since then, additional studies have shown
the beneficial impact of exercise training on exercise capacity
(6MWD) and quality of life. [312][–][316] A large, randomized controlled
trial (RCT) in 11 centres across 10 European countries, including
116 patients with PAH/CTEPH on PAH drugs, showed a significant
improvement in 6MWD of 34.1 + 8.3 m, quality of life, WHO-FC,
and peak VO 2 compared with standard of care. [315] Since most of
the studies included patients who were stable on medical treatment,
patients with PAH should be treated with the best standard of
pharmacological treatment and be in a stable clinical condition before
embarking on a supervised rehabilitation programme. Establishing
specialized rehabilitation programmes for patients with PH would
further enhance patient access to this intervention. [317]

6.3.1.2. Anticoagulation
There are several reasons to consider anticoagulation in patients with
PAH. Histopathological specimens from PAH patients’ lungs have
shown in situ thrombosis of pulmonary vessels. Patients with CHD
or PA aneurysms may develop thrombosis of the central PAs.
Abnormalities in the coagulation and fibrinolytic system indicating a
pro-coagulant state have been reported in patients with PAH. [318]

Data from RCTs on anticoagulation in PAH are lacking, and registry data have yielded conflicting results. The largest registry analysis
so far suggested a potential survival benefit associated with anticoagulation in patients with IPAH, [319] but this finding was not confirmed
by others. [320] Two recent meta-analyses also concluded that using
anticoagulants may improve survival in patients with IPAH; [321][,][322]

however, none of the included studies were methodologically robust. Despite the lack of evidence, registry data obtained between
2007 and 2016 showed that anticoagulation was used in 43% of patients with IPAH. [293] In PAH associated with SSc, registry data and
meta-analyses uniformly indicated that anticoagulation may be harmful. [320][–][322] In CHD, there are also no RCTs on anticoagulation. There
is also no consensus about the use of anticoagulants in patients who
have permanent i.v. lines for therapy with prostacyclin analogues; this
is left to local centre practice.
As anticoagulation is associated with an increased bleeding risk,
and in the absence of robust data, no general recommendation has
been made for or against the use of anticoagulants in patients with
PAH.; therefore, individual decision-making is required.

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3661


6.3.1.3. Diuretics

Right HF is associated with systemic fluid retention, reduced renal
blood flow, and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Increased right-sided filling pressures are transmitted to the renal veins, increasing interstitial and tubular hydrostatic pressure
within the encapsulated kidney, which decreases net glomerular filtration rate and oxygen delivery. [119]

Avoiding fluid retention is one of the key objectives in managing patients with PH. Once these patients develop signs of right-sided HF and
oedema, restricting fluid intake and using diuretics is recommended.
The three main classes of diuretics—loop diuretics, thiazides, and min
—
eralocorticoid receptor antagonists are used as monotherapy or in
combination, as determined by the patient’s clinical need and kidney
function. Patients requiring diuretic therapy should be advised to regularly monitor their body weight and to seek medical advice in case of
weight gain. Close collaboration between patients, PH centres, especially PH nurses, and primary care physicians plays a vital role. Kidney function and serum electrolytes should be regularly monitored, and
intravascular volume depletion must be avoided as it may cause a further decline in CO and systemic blood pressure. Physicians should
bear in mind that fluid retention and oedema may not necessarily signal
right-sided HF, but may also be a side effect of PAH therapy. [323]

6.3.1.4. Oxygen
Although oxygen administration reduces PVR and improves exercise
tolerance in patients with PAH, there are no data to suggest that longterm oxygen therapy has sustained benefits on the course of the disease. Most patients with PAH, except those with CHD and
pulmonary-to-systemic shunts, have minor degrees of arterial hypoxaemia at rest, unless they have a patent foramen ovale. Data show that
nocturnal oxygen therapy does not modify the natural history of advanced Eisenmenger syndrome. [324] In the absence of robust data on
the use of oxygen in patients with PAH, guidance is based on evidence
in patients with COPD; [325] when PaO 2 is,8 kPa (60 mmHg; alternatively, SaO 2,92%) on at least two occasions, patients are advised to
take oxygen to achieve a PaO 2 .8 kPa. Ambulatory oxygen may be
considered when there is evidence of symptomatic benefit and correctable desaturation on exercise. [326][,][327] Nocturnal oxygen therapy
should be considered in case of sleep-related desaturation. [328]

6.3.1.5. Cardiovascular drugs
No data from rigorous clinical trials are available on the usefulness
and safety of drugs that are effective in systemic hypertension or leftsided HF, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angio
–
tensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors
(SGLT-2is), beta-blockers, or ivabradine in patients with PAH. In
this group of patients, these drugs may lead to potentially dangerous
drops in blood pressure, heart rate, or both. Likewise, the efficacy of
digoxin/digitoxin has not been documented in PAH, although these
drugs may be administered to slow ventricular rate in patients with
PAH who develop atrial tachyarrhythmias.

6.3.1.6. Anaemia and iron status

Iron deficiency is common in patients with PAH and is defined by serum ferritin,100 µg/L, or serum ferritin 100–299 µg/L and


transferrin saturation,20%. [329] The underlying pathological mechanisms are complex. [330][–][333] In patients with PAH, iron deficiency
is associated with impaired myocardial function, aggravated symptoms, and increased mortality risk. [333][,][334] Based on these data, regular
monitoring of iron status (serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation,
soluble transferrin receptors) is recommended in patients with PAH.
In patients with severe iron deficiency anaemia (Hb,7–8 g/dL),
i.v. supplementation is recommended. [335][–][337] Oral iron formulations
containing ferrous (Fe [2][+] ) sulfate, ferrous gluconate, and ferrous fumarate are often poorly tolerated, and drug efficacy may be impaired
in patients with PAH. [330][,][331] Ferric maltol is a new, orally available formulation of ferric (Fe [3][+] ) iron and maltol. One small, open-label study
suggested good tolerability and efficacy in patients with severe PH
with mild-to-moderate iron deficiency and anaemia. [338] In contrast,
two small, 12 week, randomized, cross-over trials studying iron sup
                                         plementation in PAH patients without anaemia provided no signifi
cant clinical benefit. [339] Randomized controlled trials comparing
oral and i.v. iron supplementation in patients with PAH are lacking.

6.3.1.7. Vaccination

As a general health care measure, it is recommended that patients
with PAH be vaccinated at least against influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and SARS-CoV-2.

6.3.1.8. Psychosocial support
Receiving a diagnosis of PH—often after a substantial delay—and experiencing the physical limitations have a substantial impact on psychological, emotional, and social aspects of patients and their
families. Symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as adjustment
disorders, have a high prevalence in patients with PAH. Pulmonary
arterial hypertension also has grave repercussions on ability to
work and income. [281][,][340][–][344]

Empathic and hopeful communication is essential for physicians
caring for patients with PAH. Awareness and knowledge about the
disease and its treatment options empower patients to engage in
shared decision-making. Adequate diagnostic screening tools are
the key to identifying patients in need of referral for psychological/
psychiatric support, including psychopharmacological medication, [345]

or social assistance. Patient support groups may play an important
role, and patients should be advised to join such groups. Given the
life-limiting character of PAH, advanced care planning with referral
to specialist palliative care services should be supported at the right
time. [346]

6.3.1.9. Adherence to treatments

Adhering to medical therapy is key to successfully managing PAH. In
general, factors that affect adherence are patient related (e.g. demographics, cognitive impairment, polypharmacy, adverse reactions/
side effects, psychological health, health literacy, patient understanding of the treatment rationale, and comorbidities), physician related
(expertise, awareness of guidelines, and multidisciplinary team approach), and health care system related (work setting, access to
treatments, and cost). [347]

Recent studies have indicated that adherence to drug therapy in
patients with PAH may be suboptimal. [348][,][349] Given the complexity
of PAH treatment, potential side effects, and risks associated with
treatment interruptions, adherence should be periodically

3662 ESC/ERS Guidelines


monitored by a member of the multidisciplinary team, to identify
non-adherence and any changes to the treatment regimen spontaneously triggered by patients or non-expert physicians. To promote
adherence, it is important to ensure that patients are involved in
care decisions and appropriately informed about treatment options
and rationale, expectations, side effects, and potential consequences
of non-adherence. Patients should be advised that any changes in
treatment should be made in cooperation with the PH centre.

6.3.2. Special circumstances
6.3.2.1. Pregnancy and birth control
6.3.2.1.1. Pregnancy. Historically, pregnancy in women with PAH

and other forms of severe PH has been associated with maternal

mortality rates of up to 56% and neonatal mortality rates of up to
13%. [350] With improved treatment of PAH and new approaches to
managing women during pregnancy and the peri-partum period, maternal mortality has declined but remains high, ranging 11–25%. [351][–][355]

For these reasons, previous ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and
treatment of PH have recommended that patients with PAH should
avoid pregnancy. [25][,][26] However, there are reports of favourable pregnancy outcomes in women with PH, including, but not limited to, women with IPAH who respond to CCB therapy. [353][,][354][,][356][,][357]

Nonetheless, pregnancy remains associated with unforeseeable risks,
and may accelerate PH progression. [358] Women with PH can deteriorate at any time during or after pregnancy. Therefore, physicians
have a responsibility to inform patients about the risks of pregnancy,

so that women and their families can make informed decisions.

Women with poorly controlled disease, indicated by an
intermediate- or high-risk profile and signs of RV dysfunction, are
at high risk of adverse outcomes; in the event of pregnancy, they
should be carefully counselled and early termination should be advised. For patients with well-controlled disease, a low-risk profile,
and normal or near-normal resting haemodynamics who consider
becoming pregnant, individual counselling and shared decisionmaking are recommended. In such cases, alternatives such as adoption and surrogacy may also be explored. Pre-conception genetic
counselling should also be considered in HPAH.
Women with PH who become pregnant or present during pregnancy with newly diagnosed PAH should be treated, whenever possible, in centres with a multidisciplinary team experienced in
managing PH in pregnancy. If pregnancy is continued, PAH therapy
may have to be adjusted. It is recommended to stop endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), riociguat, and selexipag because of potential or unknown teratogenicity. [359] Despite limited evidence, CCBs,
PDE5is, and inhaled/i.v./subcutaneous (s.c.) prostacyclin analogues
are considered safe during pregnancy. [356][,][360]

Pregnancy in PH is a very sensitive topic and requires empathic
communication. Psychological support should be offered whenever

needed.

6.3.2.1.2. Contraception. Women with PH of childbearing potential should be provided with clear contraceptive advice, considering
the individual needs of the woman but recognizing that the implications of contraceptive failure are significant in PH. With appropriate
use, many forms of contraception, including oral contraceptives, are
highly effective. In patients treated with bosentan, reduced efficacy of


hormonal contraceptives should be carefully considered. [361] Using
hormonal implants or an intrauterine device are alternative options
with low failure rates. Surgical sterilization may be considered but is
associated with peri-operative risks. Emergency post-coital hormonal contraception is safe in PH.

6.3.2.2. Surgical procedures
Surgical procedures in patients with PH are associated with an elevated risk of right HF and death. In a prospective, multinational registry including 114 patients with PAH who underwent non-cardiac and
non-obstetric surgery, the peri-operative mortality rate was 2% in
elective procedures and 15% in emergency procedures. [362] The mortality risk was associated with the severity of PH. The decision to perform surgery should be made by a multidisciplinary team involving a
PH physician, and must be based on an individual risk:benefit assessment considering various factors, including indication, urgency, PH
severity, and patient preferences. Risk scores to predict the perioperative mortality risk have been developed but require further validation. [363] General recommendations cannot be made. The same is

true regarding the preferred mode of anaesthesia. Pre-operative optimization of PAH therapy should be attempted whenever possible
(see also the 2022 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular assessment
and management of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery). [364]

6.3.2.3. Travel and altitude

Hypobaric hypoxia may induce arterial hypoxaemia, additional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and increased RV load in
PAH. [365][,][366] Cabin aircraft pressures are equivalent to altitudes up
to 2438 m, [367] at which the PaO 2 decreases to that of an inspired
O 2 fraction of 15.1% at sea level. [365] However, evidence suggests
that short-term (less than 1 day) normobaric hypoxia is generally
well tolerated in clinically stable patients with PAH. [365][,][368][–][372]

In-flight oxygen administration is advised for patients using oxygen
at sea level and for those with PaO 2,8 kPa (60 mmHg) or SaO 2
,92%. [25][,][26][,][325][,][369][,][372] An oxygen flow rate of 2 L/min will raise inspired oxygen pressure to values as at sea level, and patients already
using oxygen at sea level should increase their oxygen flow
rate. [25][,][26][,][373]

–
As the effects of moderate to long-term (hours days) hypoxia exposure in PAH remain largely unexplored, [374][,][375] patients should
avoid altitudes .1500 m without supplemental oxygen. [25][,][26][,][369]

However, patients with PAH who are not hypoxaemic at sea level
have tolerated day trips to 2500 m reasonably well. [376] Patients
should travel with written information about their disease, including
a medication list, bring extra doses of their medication, and be informed about local PH centres near their travel destination. [25][,][26]

6.3.3. Pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies
6.3.3.1. Calcium channel blockers

Patients with PAH who respond favourably to acute vasoreactivity
testing (Figure 8) may respond favourably to treatment with
CCBs. [129][,][146] Less than 10% of patients with IPAH, HPAH, or DPAH
are responders, while an acute vasodilator response does not predict
a favourable long-term response to CCBs in patients with other forms
of PAH. [129][,][146][,][378] The CCBs that have predominantly been used in
PAH are nifedipine, diltiazem, and amlodipine. [129][,][146] Amlodipine and
felodipine are increasingly being used in clinical practice due to their
long half-life and good tolerability. The daily doses that have shown efficacy in PAH are relatively high and they must be reached progressively (Table 19). The most common adverse events are systemic
hypotension and peripheral oedema.
Patients who meet the criteria for a positive acute vasodilator response and treated with CCBs should be closely followed for safety
and efficacy, with a complete reassessment after 3–6 months of therapy, including RHC. Additional acute vasoreactivity testing should be
performed at re-evaluation to detect persistent vasodilator response, supporting possible increases in CCB dosage. Patients with
a satisfactory chronic response present with WHO-FC I/II and
marked haemodynamic improvement (ideally, mPAP,30 mmHg
and PVR,4 WU) while on CCB therapy. In the absence of a satisfactory response, additional PAH therapy should be instituted. In
some cases, a combination of CCBs with approved PAH drugs is required because of clinical deterioration with CCB withdrawal

attempts. Patients who have not undergone a vasoreactivity study or
those with a negative test should not be started on CCBs because of
potentially severe side effects (e.g. severe hypotension, syncope, and
RV failure), unless prescribed at standard doses for other
indications. [379]

pulmonary endothelial cells, promoting vasodilation through accelerated production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide, and clearance of
endothelin-1. [380] Nevertheless, selective blocking of endothelin A receptors alone or non-selective blocking of both A and B receptors
has shown similar effectiveness in PAH. [380] Endothelial receptor antagonists have teratogenic effects and should not be used during
pregnancy. [381]

6.3.3.2.1. Ambrisentan. Ambrisentan is an oral ERA that preferentially blocks the endothelin A receptors. The approved dosages in
adults are 5 mg and 10 mg o.d. In patients with PAH, it has demonstrated efficacy for symptoms, exercise capacity, haemodynamics,
and time to clinical worsening. [382] An increased incidence of


peripheral oedema was reported with ambrisentan use, while there

was no increased incidence of abnormal liver function.

6.3.3.2.2. Bosentan. Bosentan is an oral, dual ERA that improves
exercise capacity, WHO-FC, haemodynamics, and time to clinical
worsening in patients with PAH. [383] The approved target dose in
adults is 125 mg b.i.d. Dose-dependent increases in liver transaminases can occur in ≏10% of treated patients (reversible after dose
reduction or discontinuation). [384] Thus, liver function testing should
be performed monthly in patients receiving bosentan. [384] Due to
pharmacokinetic interactions, bosentan may render hormonal contraceptives unreliable and lower serum levels of warfarin, sildenafil,
and tadalafil. [361][,][385][–][387]

b Intravenous epoprostenol or i.v./s.c. treprostinil.


6.3.3.2.3. Macitentan. Macitentan is an oral, dual ERA that has

been found to increase exercise capacity and reduce a composite
endpoint of clinical worsening in patients with PAH. [167] While no liver
toxicity has been shown, a reduction in Hb to ≤8 g/dL was observed
in 4.3% of patients receiving 10 mg of macitentan. [167]


6.3.3.3. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors and guanylate cyclase
stimulators

Stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by nitric oxide results in
production of the intracellular second messenger cyclic guanosine
monophosphate (cGMP) (Figure 7). This pathway is controlled by a

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3667


negative feedback loop through degradation of cGMP via different
phosphodiesterases, among which subtype 5 (PDE5) is abundantly
expressed in the pulmonary vasculature. [388] Phosphodiesterase 5 in
hibitors and sGC stimulators must not be combined with each other
and with nitrates, as this can result in systemic hypotension. [389]

6.3.3.3.1. Sildenafil. Sildenafil is an orally active, potent, and selective inhibitor of PDE5. Several RCTs of patients with PAH treated
with sildenafil (with or without background therapy) have confirmed
favourable results on exercise capacity, symptoms, and/or haemodynamics. [390][–][392] The approved dose of sildenafil is 20 mg t.i.d.
Most side effects of sildenafil are mild to moderate and mainly related
to vasodilation (headache, flushing, and epistaxis).

6.3.3.3.2. Tadalafil. Tadalafil is a once-daily administered PDE5i. An
RCT of 406 patients with PAH (53% on background bosentan therapy) treated with tadalafil at doses up to 40 mg o.d. showed favourable results on exercise capacity, symptoms, haemodynamics, and
time to clinical worsening. [393] The side effect profile was similar to
that of sildenafil.

6.3.3.3.3. Riociguat. While PDE5is augment the nitric oxide–cGMP
pathway by slowing cGMP degradation, sGC stimulators enhance
cGMP production by directly stimulating the enzyme, both in the
presence and absence of endogenous nitric oxide. [394] An RCT of
443 patients with PAH (44% and 6% on background therapy with
ERAs or prostacyclin analogues, respectively) treated with riociguat
up to 2.5 mg t.i.d. showed favourable results on exercise capacity,
haemodynamics, WHO-FC, and time to clinical worsening. [395] The
side effect profile was similar to that of PDE5is.

6.3.3.4. Prostacyclin analogues and prostacyclin receptor agonists
The prostacyclin metabolic pathway (Figure 7) is dysregulated in patients with PAH, with less prostacyclin synthase expressed in PAs
and reduced prostacyclin urinary metabolites. [396] Prostacyclin analogues and prostacyclin receptor agonists induce potent vasodilation,
inhibit platelet aggregation, and also have both cytoprotective and
anti-proliferative activities. [397] The most common adverse events observed with these compounds are related to systemic vasodilation
and include headache, flushing, jaw pain, and diarrhoea.

–
6.3.3.4.1. Epoprostenol. Epoprostenol has a short half-life (3
5 min) and needs continuous i.v. administration via an infusion
pump and a permanent tunnelled catheter. A thermo-stable formulation is available to maintain stability up to 48 h. [398] Its efficacy has
been demonstrated in three unblinded RCTs in patients with IPAH
(WHO-FC III and IV) [399][,][400] and SSc-associated PAH. [401]

Epoprostenol improved symptoms, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and mortality. [399] Long-term, persistent efficacy has also been
shown in IPAH, [212][,][245] as well as in other associated PAH conditions. [402][–][404] Serious adverse events related to the delivery system include pump malfunction, local site infection, catheter obstruction,
and sepsis. Recommendations for preventing central venous catheter bloodstream infections have been proposed. [405][,][406]

6.3.3.4.2. Iloprost. Iloprost is a prostacyclin analogue approved for
inhaled administration. Inhaled iloprost has been evaluated in one


RCT, in which six to nine repetitive iloprost inhalations were compared with placebo in treatment-naïve patients with PAH or
CTEPH. [407] The study showed an increase in exercise capacity and
improvement in symptoms, PVR, and clinical events in the iloprost
group compared with the placebo group.

6.3.3.4.3. Treprostinil. Treprostinil is available for s.c., i.v., inhaled,
and oral administration. Treprostinil s.c. improved exercise capacity,
haemodynamics, and symptoms in PAH. [408] Infusion-site pain was the

most common adverse effect, which led to treatment discontinuation in 8% of cases. [408] Based on its chemical stability, i.v. treprostinil
may also be administered via implantable pumps, improving convenience and likely decreasing the occurrence of line infections. [409][,][410]

Inhaled treprostinil improved the 6MWD, NT-proBNP, and quality of life measures in patients with PAH on background therapy with
either bosentan or sildenafil. [411] Inhaled treprostinil is not approved
in Europe.
Oral treprostinil has been evaluated in two RCTs of patients with
PAH on background therapy with bosentan and/or sildenafil. In both
trials, the primary endpoint—6MWD—did not reach statistical significance. [412][,][413] An additional RCT in treatment-naïve patients with
PAH showed improved 6MWD. [414] An event-driven RCT that enrolled 690 patients with PAH demonstrated that oral treprostinil reduced the risk of clinical worsening events in patients who were
receiving oral monotherapy with ERAs or PDE5is. [415] Oral treprostinil is not approved in Europe.

6.3.3.4.4. Beraprost. Beraprost is a chemically stable and orally active prostacyclin analogue. Two RCTs have shown a modest, shortterm improvement in exercise capacity in patients with PAH; [416][,][417]

however, there were no haemodynamic improvements or long-term
outcome benefits. Beraprost is not approved in Europe.

6.3.3.4.5. Selexipag. Selexipag is an orally available, selective, prostacyclin receptor agonist that is chemically distinct from prostacyclin,
with different pharmacology. In a pilot RCT in patients with PAH (receiving stable ERA and/or PDE5i therapy), selexipag reduced PVR
after 17 weeks. [418] An event-driven, phase 3 RCT that enrolled
1156 patients [419] showed that selexipag alone or on top of mono
or double therapy with an ERA and/or a PDE5i reduced the relative
risk of composite morbidity/mortality events by 40%. The most common side effects were headache, diarrhoea, nausea, and jaw pain.

6.3.4. Treatment strategies for patients with
idiopathic, heritable, drug-associated, or
connective tissue disease-associated pulmonary
arterial hypertension
Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare and life-threatening disease
and should be managed, where possible, at PH centres in close collaboration with the patient’s local physicians.
This section describes drug treatment and is focused on nonvasoreactive patients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH and on patients
with PAH associated with connective tissue disease (PAH-CTD).
Information on the dosing of PAH medication is summarized in
Table 19. For other forms of PAH, treatment strategies have to be
modified (see Section 7). The approach to vasoreactive patients

with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH is described in Section 6.3.3.1.

3668 ESC/ERS Guidelines


In addition to targeted drug treatment, the comprehensive management of patients with PAH includes general measures that may
include supplementary oxygen, diuretics to optimize volume status,
psychosocial support, and standardized exercise training (Section
6.3.1). [315] Prior to the treatment decisions, patients and their next
of kin should be provided with appropriate and timely information
about the risks and benefits of the treatment options so they can
make the final, informed, and joint decision about the treatment
with the medical team. Treatment decisions in patients with IPAH/
HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD should be stratified according to the
presence or absence of cardiopulmonary comorbidities (Section
6.3.4.3) and according to disease severity assessed by risk stratification (Section 6.2.7).

6.3.4.1. Initial treatment decision in patients without
cardiopulmonary comorbidities
The initial treatment of patients with PAH should be based on a comprehensive, multiparameter risk assessment, considering disease
type and severity, comorbidities, access to therapies, economic aspects, and patient preference.
The following considerations predominantly apply to patients with
IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD without cardiopulmonary comorbidities, as patients with comorbidities were under-represented
in the clinical studies addressing treatment strategies and combination therapy in patients with PAH. Treatment considerations for patients with PAH and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are summarized

in Section 6.3.4.3.

For patients presenting at low or intermediate risk, initial combination therapy with an ERA and a PDE5i is recommended. This approach was assessed in the AMBITION study, which compared
initial combination therapy using ambrisentan at a target dose of
10 mg o.d. and tadalafil at a target dose of 40 mg o.d. with initial
monotherapy with either drug. [166] AMBITION predominantly included patients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD. The primary
endpoint was the time to first clinical failure event (a composite of
death, hospitalization for worsening PAH, disease progression, or
unsatisfactory long-term clinical response). The hazard ratio (HR)
for the primary endpoint in the combination-therapy group vs. the
pooled monotherapy group was 0.50 (95% confidence interval

[CI], 0.35–0.72; P, 0.001) and there were significant improvements
in 6MWD and NT-proBNP with initial combination therapy. At the
end of the study, 10% of the patients assigned to initial combination
therapy had died compared with 14% of the patients assigned to ini
–
tial monotherapy (HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.42 1.08). [420]

In the TRITON study, treatment-naïve patients with PAH were
assigned to initial dual-combination therapy with macitentan and
tadalafil, or initial triple-combination therapy with macitentan
10 mg o.d., tadalafil at a target dose of 40 mg o.d., and selexipag
up to 1600 µg o.d. [421] TRITON predominantly included patients

with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD. At week 26, PVR was re
duced by 52% and 54%, with double- or triple-combination therapy, respectively, and 6MWD had increased by 55 m and 56 m,
respectively. The geometric means of the NT-proBNP ratio
from baseline to week 26 were 0.25 and 0.26, respectively.
Hence, TRITON did not show a benefit of oral triple- vs. oral
double-combination therapy but confirmed that substantial improvements in haemodynamics and exercise capacity can be


obtained with initial ERA/PDE5i combination therapy. Further
studies are needed to determine whether oral triple-combination
therapy impacts long-term outcomes.
Based on the evidence generated by these and other studies, [303][,][422][–][424] initial dual-combination therapy with an ERA and a
PDE5i is recommended for newly diagnosed patients who present
at low or intermediate risk. Initial oral triple-combination therapy
is not recommended, given the current lack of evidence supporting
this strategy. In patients presenting at high risk, initial triplecombination therapy including an i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogue
should be considered. [426][,][427] While it is acknowledged that the evidence for this approach is limited to case series, there is consensus
that this strategy has the highest likelihood of success, especially in
view of registry data from France showing that initial triplecombination therapy including an i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogue was
associated with better long-term survival than monotherapy or dualcombination therapy. [428] Initial triple-combination therapy including
an i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogue should also be considered in patients
at intermediate risk presenting with severe haemodynamic impairment (e.g. RAP ≥20 mmHg, CI,2.0 L/min/m [2], SVI,31 mL/m [2],
and/or PVR ≥12 WU). [238][,][426]

The recommendations for initial oral double-combination therapy
[are based on PICO question I (Supplementary Data, Section 6.2).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
Although the quality of evidence is low, initial oral combination therapy with an ERA and a PDE5i achieves important targets in symptom
improvement (functional class), exercise capacity, cardiac biomarkers, and reduction of hospitalizations.

6.3.4.2. Treatment decisions during follow-up in patients without
cardiopulmonary comorbidities
Patients with PAH require regular follow-up, including risk stratification and an assessment of patient concordance with therapy.


Patients who achieve a low-risk status have a much superior
long-term survival compared with patients with intermediateor high-risk status. [292][,][295][,][296] Achieving and maintaining a lowrisk profile is therefore a key objective in managing patients

with PAH.

Several clinical trials have assessed the safety and efficacy of sequential combination therapy in patients with PAH. SERAPHIN enrolled 742 patients with PAH, mostly with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH and
PAH-CTD, of whom 63.7% were receiving other PAH medication
at the time of enrolment, mostly sildenafil. [167] In the subgroup of patients with background PAH therapy, macitentan at a daily dose of
10 mg reduced the risk of clinical worsening events compared with

–
placebo (HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43 0.89). [167]

GRIPHON assessed the safety and efficacy of selexipag. [419] This
study enrolled 1156 patients with PAH, also mostly with IPAH/

HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD, who were treatment naïve or receiv
ing background therapy with an ERA, PDE5i, or a combination of
both. Selexipag at a dose of up to 1600 µg b.i.d. was associated
with a reduced risk of clinical worsening events independent of
the background medication. In patients receiving ERA/PDE5i combination therapy (n = 376), the risk of clinical worsening events was

–
lower with selexipag than with placebo (HR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44
0.90). [431]

The effects of combination therapy on long-term survival in patients with PAH remain unclear. A 2016 meta-analysis demonstrated
that combination therapy (initial and sequential) was associated with
a significant risk reduction for clinical worsening (relative risk [RR]
0.65; 95% CI, 0.58–0.72; P, 0.0001); [432] however, all-cause mortality
was not improved (RR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72–1.03; P = 0.09) and a substantial proportion of patients had clinical worsening events or died
despite receiving combination therapy. In addition, registry data
showed that the use of combination therapy increased since 2015
but there was no clear improvement in overall survival
rates. [428][,][433][,][434] These data were corroborated by a study showing
that less than half of patients receiving initial combination therapy

with an ERA and a PDE5i achieved and maintained a low-risk
profile. [422]

Switching from PDE5is to riociguat has also been investigated as
a treatment-escalation strategy. [429][,][435] REPLACE was a randomized, controlled, open-label study that enrolled patients on a
PDE5i-based therapy who were in WHO-FC III and had a
6MWD of 165–440 m. [429] The study predominantly included pa
tients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or PAH-CTD who were rando
mized to continue their PDE5i or to switch from a PDE5i to

riociguat up to 2.5 mg t.i.d. The study met its primary endpoint,
termed ‘clinical improvement’, which was a composite of prespecified improvements in 6MWD, WHO-FC, and NT-proBNP
at week 24. Clinical improvement at week 24 was demonstrated
in 41% of the patients who switched to riociguat and in 20% of
the patients who maintained their PDE5i (odds ratio [OR] 2.78;
95% CI, 1.53–5.06; P = 0.0007). In addition, fewer patients in the
riociguat group experienced a clinical worsening event (OR 0.10;
95% CI, 0.01–0.73; P = 0.0047).
Based on the evidence summarized above, the following recommendations for treatment decisions during follow-up are:

3670 ESC/ERS Guidelines


(i) In patients who achieve a low-risk status with their initial PAH
therapy, continuation of treatment is recommended.

–
(ii) In patients who are at intermediate low risk despite receiving
ERA/PDE5i therapy, adding selexipag should be considered to
reduce the risk of clinical worsening. In these patients, switching
from PDE5i to riociguat may also be considered.

–
(iii) In patients who are at intermediate high or high risk while receiving oral therapies, the addition of i.v. epoprostenol or i.v./
s.c. treprostinil and referral for LTx evaluation should be considered. [309][,][436] If adding i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogues is unfeasible,
adding selexipag or switching from PDE5i to riociguat may be

considered.

6.3.4.3. Pulmonary arterial hypertension with cardiopulmonary
comorbidities

Over the past decade, the demographics and characteristics of patients with IPAH have changed, especially in industrialized countries. [447] In several contemporary registries, the average age of
patients diagnosed with IPAH is ≏60 years or older. [161][,][295][,][299][,][447][,][448]

Many elderly patients have cardiopulmonary comorbidities, making the distinction from group 2 and group 3 PH challenging.
Among elderly patients diagnosed with IPAH, two main disease
phenotypes have emerged. One phenotype (herein called the
left heart phenotype) consists of elderly, mostly female patients
with risk factors for HFpEF (e.g. hypertension, obesity, diabetes,
or coronary heart disease) but pre-capillary PH rather than postcapillary PH; [449][,][450] ≏30% of these patients have a history of atrial
fibrillation. [161] The other phenotype (called the cardiopulmonary
phenotype) consists of elderly, predominantly male patients who
have a low DLCO (,45% of the predicted value), are often hypoxaemic, have a significant smoking history, and have risk factors for LHD. [77][,][78][,][161][,][451] In a cluster analysis of 841 newly
diagnosed patients with IPAH from the COMPERA registry,
12.6% had a classic phenotype of young, mostly female patients
without cardiopulmonary comorbidities, while 35.8% presented
with a left heart phenotype and 51.6% with a cardiopulmonary
phenotype. [161]

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3671


There are no evidence-based rules for determining a
patient’s phenotype. The AMBITION study used the presence
of more than three risk factors for LHD together with
certain haemodynamic criteria to exclude patients from the
primary analysis. [166] However, the COMPERA cluster analysis
mentioned above found that the presence of a single risk
factor may change the phenotype. [161] Pending further data, it is
the overall profile that should be used to determine a patient’s
phenotype.
Compared with patients without cardiopulmonary comorbidities,
patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities respond less well to
PAH medication, are more likely to discontinue this medication
due to efficacy failure or lack of tolerability, are less likely to reach
a low-risk status, and have a higher mortality risk. While the
age-adjusted mortality of patients with the left heart phenotype
seems to be similar to that of patients with classical PAH, patients
with a cardiopulmonary phenotype and a low DLCO have a particularly high mortality risk. [77][,][78][,][161][,][450][,][451]

As patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities were underrepresented in or excluded from PAH trials, no evidence-based
treatment recommendations can be made for this patient population. Registry data suggest that most physicians use PDE5is as primary treatment for these patients. Endothelin receptor
antagonists or PDE5i/ERA combinations are occasionally used,
but the drug discontinuation rate is higher than in patients with
classical PAH. [447][,][450] A subgroup analysis from AMBITION, which
assessed the response to PAH therapy in 105 patients who were
excluded from the primary analysis set because of a left heart

—
phenotype, found that these patients compared with patients

—
in the primary analysis set had less clinical improvement and a
higher likelihood of drug discontinuations due to safety and tolerability with both monotherapy and initial combination therapy. [449]

Data from the ASPIRE registry demonstrated that patients with
IPAH and a cardiopulmonary phenotype had less improvement
in exercise capacity and PROMs compared with patients with classical IPAH. [451]

In patients with a left heart phenotype, ERA therapy is
associated with an elevated risk of fluid retention. [449] Moreover,
in patients with a cardiopulmonary phenotype, PAH medication
may cause a decline in the peripheral oxygen saturation. [452]

There is little published experience on the use of prostacyclin analogues or prostacyclin receptor agonists in this patient
population. [453]

The lack of solid evidence for treating elderly patients with PAH
and cardiopulmonary comorbidities makes treatment recommendations challenging, and patients should be counselled accordingly.
In the absence of evidence on treatment strategies in these patients,
risk stratification is of limited usefulness in guiding therapeutic
[decision-making. Initial monotherapy (see Supplementary Data,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
[Table S3) is recommended for most of these patients, with](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
PDE5is being the most widely used compounds according to registry data. [161] Further treatment decisions should be made on an in
dividual basis in collaboration with the PH centre and local

physicians.

algorithm.

6.3.5. Drug interactions
Among PAH drugs, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions
are observed between bosentan and sildenafil (reduced sildenafil
plasma concentration [385] ), bosentan and hormonal contraceptives
(reduced contraception efficacy [361] ), and bosentan and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (potential need for VKA dose adjustment [386] ).
Additional pharmacokinetic interactions of potential clinical rele[vance are listed in Supplementary Data, Table S4.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)

6.3.6. Interventional therapy
6.3.6.1. Balloon atrial septostomy and Potts shunt
Balloon atrial septostomy, [454][,][455] by creating an interatrial shunt, and
Potts shunt, [456][–][459] by connecting the left PA and descending aorta,
aim to decompress the right heart and increase systemic blood
flow, thereby improving systemic oxygen transport despite arterial
oxygen desaturation. As these procedures are complex and associated with high risk, including substantial procedure-related mortality, they are rarely performed in patients with PAH and may only be
considered in centres with experience in the techniques.

6.3.6.2. Pulmonary artery denervation
The rationale for performing a PA denervation (PADN) is based on
the increased sympathetic overdrive characterizing PAH, which is associated with poor outcome. [460][,][461] Although the contribution of this
mechanism to developing PAH is not completely understood, it is associated with vasoconstriction and vascular remodelling through a
baroreflex mediated by stretch receptors located at the bifurcation
of the PAs. [462][,][463] Applying radiofrequency at the latter acutely and

chronically improves haemodynamic variables. [464] However, there is
little evidence yet from multicentre RCTs demonstrating a benefit
of PADN in patients already receiving recommended medical therapy.
A small multicentre study tested the feasibility of PADN using an intravascular ultrasound catheter in patients receiving dual or triple therapy
for PAH; [465] the procedure was safe and associated with a reduction in
PVR, and increases in 6MWD and daily activity. Although potentially
promising, PADN should be considered experimental.

6.3.7. Advanced right ventricular failure
6.3.7.1. Intensive care unit management
Patients with PH may require intensive care treatment for right HF,
comorbidities (including major surgery), or both. The mortality risk is
high in such patients, [466][,][467] and specialized centres should be involved whenever possible. In addition to basic intensive care unit
(ICU) standards, RV function in these patients should be carefully
monitored. Non-specific clinical signs of right HF with low CO include pale skin with peripheral cyanosis, hypotension, tachycardia,
declining urine output, and increasing lactate levels. Non-invasive
monitoring should include biomarkers (NT-proBNP and troponin)
and echocardiography. Minimum invasive monitoring consists of an
upper body central venous catheter to measure central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation, the latter reflecting CO.
Right heart catheterization or other forms of advanced haemodynamic assessment should be considered in patients with advanced
right HF or in complex situations. [468]

Treating right HF should focus on treatable triggers such as infection, arrhythmia, anaemia, and other comorbidities. Fluid management is of utmost importance in these patients, most of whom
require a negative fluid balance to reduce RV pre-load, thereby improving RV geometry and function. [468] Patients with a low CO may
benefit from treatment with inotropes; dobutamine and milrinone
are the most frequently used substances in this setting. Maintaining
the mean systemic blood pressure .60 mmHg is a key objective
when treating right HF, and patients with persistent hypotension
may require vasopressors such as norepinephrine or vasopressin.

Intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation should be avoided

whenever possible in patients with advanced RV failure because of
a high risk of further haemodynamic deterioration and death.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension medication should be considered
on an individual basis, taking into account underlying disease, comorbidities, and existing medication. In patients with newly diagnosed PAH presenting with low CO, combination therapy
including i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogues should be considered. [426]

6.3.7.2. Mechanical circulatory support
In specialist centres, various forms of mechanical circulatory support
are available for managing RV failure, with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) being the most widely used approach. Mechanical circulatory support has become an established
bridging tool to transplantation in patients with irreversible right HF,
but is occasionally used as a bridge to recovery in patients with treatable causes and potentially reversible RV failure. [468] No general recommendations can be made regarding the indication for mechanical
circulatory support, which needs to be individualized, considering patient factors and local resources. [469][,][470] Long-term mechanical support


analogous to left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is not yet available
for patients with PH and end-stage right HF.

6.3.8. Lung and heart lung transplantation
Lung transplantation remains an important treatment option for patients with PAH refractory to optimized medical therapy. In patients
with PAH, referral to an LTx centre should be considered early
(Table 20):

(1) when they present with an inadequate response to treatment
despite optimized combination therapy; (2) when they present
with an intermediate–high or high risk of death (i.e. 1-year mortality
.10% when estimated with established risk-stratification tools) [471]

(see Section 6.2.7), which exceeds the current mortality rate after
LTx; [472] (3) when patients have a disease variant that poorly responds
to medical therapy, such as PVOD or PCH.
Both heart–lung and bilateral LTx have been performed for PAH.
Currently, most patients receive bilateral LTx, while combined
heart–lung transplantation is reserved for patients who have additional non-correctable cardiac conditions. [473] With the introduction

of the lung allocation score (LAS), waiting list mortality has decreased
and the odds of receiving a donor organ have increased. [474] In some
countries, an ‘exceptional LAS’ can be obtained for patients with severe PH. Some other countries not using the LAS have successfully
implemented high-priority programmes for these patients. [475] The
patient and their next of kin should be fully engaged in the transplant
assessment process and informed of the risks and benefits, and the
final decision should be jointly made between the patient and medical
team (see Section 6.3.1.8). For patients with PAH who survive the
early post-transplant period, long-term outcomes are good. A study
found that for primary transplant patients with IPAH who survived
to 1 year, conditional median survival was 10.0 years. [476]

6.3.9. Evidence-based treatment algorithm
A treatment algorithm for patients with IPAH/HPAH/DPAH or
PAH-CTD is shown in Figure 9. The evidence supporting this algorithm has mainly been generated in patients with IPAH/HPAH/
DPAH or PAH-CTD who present without cardiopulmonary co
morbidities. Patients with HIV-associated PAH, PoPH, and PAH as
sociated with congenital heart disease were not enrolled or
under-represented in most PAH therapy trials. Treatment recommendations for these patients are provided in Section 7.

6.3.10. Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary
arterial hypertension complications
6.3.10.1. Arrhythmias
The most common types of arrhythmias observed in PAH are supraventricular, mainly atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, while the


frequency of ventricular arrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias appears
to be considerably lower. [477][–][479] Of note, age is an independent
risk factor for atrial arrhythmias. In prospective studies, the incidence

–
of atrial arrhythmias was 3 25% over an observation time of 5 years
in cohorts primarily containing patients with IPAH. [479][–][481]

In the absence of specific evidence for PAH, managing anticoagulation in patients with PAH and atrial arrhythmia should follow the recommendations for patients with other cardiac conditions. [477]

Patients with PAH are especially sensitive to haemodynamic stress
during atrial arrhythmias due to tachycardia and loss of atrioventricular
synchrony. Maintaining sinus rhythm is an important treatment objective in these patients. New-onset arrhythmias frequently lead to clinical
deterioration and are associated with increased mortality. [481]

Observational studies have shown that a variety of rhythm control
strategies are feasible, including pharmacological cardioversion with
anti-arrhythmic drugs, electrical cardioversion, and invasive catheter
ablation procedures. To achieve or maintain a stable sinus rhythm,
prophylaxis with anti-arrhythmic drugs without negative inotropic effects, such as oral amiodarone, should be considered, even if specific
data regarding their efficacy are lacking. Low-dose beta-blockers
and/or digoxin may be used on an individual patient basis.
Catheter ablation is the preferred approach in managing atrial flutter and some other atrial tachycardias, although catheter ablation in
patients with PAH is often more technically challenging than in patients with a structurally normal right heart chamber. [482] The safety
and efficacy of ablation techniques for atrial fibrillation specifically
in the PAH population are uncertain, and it is possible that, due to
remodelling of the RA, non-pulmonary vein triggers may play a
more important role than in patients without PAH. [483]

6.3.10.2. Haemoptysis
Haemoptysis, ranging from mild to life-threatening, may occur in all
forms of PH but is particularly common in HPAH and PAH associated with CHD. Pulmonary bleeding frequently originates from enlarged bronchial arteries; [484][–][486] hence, the diagnostic evaluation of
patients with PAH and haemoptysis should include a
contrast-enhanced CT scan with an arterial phase. Even if the source
of bleeding cannot be determined, embolization of enlarged bronchial arteries is recommended in patients who present with
moderate-to-severe haemoptysis or recurrent episodes of mild
haemoptysis. Lung transplant should be considered in patients with
recurrent and severe haemoptysis despite optimized treatment.

6.3.10.3. Mechanical complications
Mechanical complications in patients with PAH usually arise from
progressive dilatation of the PA and include PA aneurysms, rupture,
and dissection, and compression of adjacent structures such as the
left main coronary artery, pulmonary veins, main bronchi, and recurrent laryngeal nerves. [487][–][492]

Pulmonary artery aneurysm was independently related to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death in one study. [492] Symptoms and
signs are non-specific; in most cases, patients are asymptomatic and
these complications are incidentally diagnosed. Pulmonary artery aneurysms are usually detected during echocardiography and best visualized
by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Treatment options for asymptomatic
PA aneurysm or PA dissection are not well defined. LTx has to be considered on an individual basis. [490][,][493]

3674 ESC/ERS Guidelines


For patients with left main coronary artery compression syndrome, percutaneous coronary stenting is an effective and safe treatment. [62] For patients with asymptomatic left main coronary artery
compression or non-severe compromise of its anatomy, evaluation
with intravascular ultrasound or coronary pressure wire may help
to avoid unnecessary interventions. [494]

6.3.11. End-of-life care and ethical issues

The clinical course of PAH may be characterized by progressive deterioration and occasional episodes of acute decompensation. Life
expectancy is difficult to predict, as patients may either die slowly because of progressive right HF or experience sudden death.
Patient-orientated care is essential in managing PAH. Information
about disease severity and possible prognosis should be provided at
initial diagnosis but empathic and hopeful communication, as well as
yielding hope, is essential, in line with Section 6.3.1.8. At the right
time, open and sensitive communication will enable advanced planning and discussion of a patient’s fears, concerns, and wishes, and
will ultimately contribute to making the final, well-informed, and joint

decision about treatment with the medical team.

Patients approaching end of life require frequent assessment of
their full needs by a multidisciplinary team. In advanced stages, recognizing that cardiopulmonary resuscitation in severe PAH has a poor
outcome may enable a do not resuscitate order; this may facilitate
patients being in their preferred place of care at end of life.
Attention should be given to controlling distressing symptoms and
prescribing appropriate drugs while withdrawing medication that is
no longer needed, which may include PAH medication.
Well-informed psychological, social, and spiritual support is also vital.
Specialist palliative care should be consulted for patients whose
needs are beyond the expertise of the PH team. [346]

6.3.12. New drugs in advanced clinical development
(phase 3 studies)
Pulmonary arterial hypertension remains an incurable condition with
a high mortality rate, despite use of PAH drugs mainly targeting imbalance of vasoactive factors. Novel agents, which are currently in
phase 3 development, are ralinepag and sotatercept. Ralinepag is
an orally available prostacyclin receptor agonist, which, in a phase
2 RCT that included 61 patients with PAH, improved PVR compared
with placebo after 22 weeks of therapy. [495] Sotatercept—a fusion
protein comprising the extracellular domain of the human activin receptor type IIA linked to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin
G1—acts as a ligand trap for members of the transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β superfamily, thus restoring balance between growthpromoting and growth-inhibiting pathways. [496] In a phase 2 RCT that
included 106 patients with PAH treated over 24 weeks, s.c. sotatercept reduced PVR in patients receiving background PAH therapy; [496]

improvements were also observed in 6MWD and NT-proBNP. [496]
### 7. Specific pulmonary arterial hypertension subsets

7.1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
associated with drugs and toxins
Several drugs and toxins are associated with developing PAH or
PVOD/PCH. Historically, certain appetite suppressants and toxic


rapeseed oil were the most prominent examples, whereas methamphetamines, interferons, and some tyrosine kinase inhibitors are
more common causes nowadays (Table 7). Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare complication in patients exposed to these drugs, and
many of these drugs have also been linked to other pulmonary complications such as parenchymal lung disease or pleural effusions.
These pulmonary complications may occur concurrently.
Methamphetamine-associated PAH has mainly been reported

from the USA, where some centres have found that 20–29% of their

otherwise idiopathic cases of PAH were associated with methamphetamine use. [497][,][498] Compared with patients with IPAH, those
with methamphetamine-associated PAH had more severe haemodynamic impairment and a higher mortality risk. [498] Alpha and beta
interferons have also been associated with developing PAH. [499] The
same is true of some tyrosine kinase inhibitors, especially dasatinib,
but also bosutinib and ponatinib. [40][,][500]

Drug- or toxin-induced PAH should always be considered in patients presenting with unexplained exertional dyspnoea or other
warning signs. The diagnostic approach should be the same as in
other forms of PH, and the diagnosis is usually made by excluding
other forms of PH in patients who have been exposed to drugs associated with developing PAH.
Treatment of DPAH follows the same basic principles as treating
other forms of PAH. Importantly, partial or full reversal of PAH has
been reported after discontinuing the causative agent, at least for interferons and dasatinib. [499][,][500] Hence, multidisciplinary management
of the patient should include discontinuing the presumed causative
agents once PAH is diagnosed (also see the 2022 ESC Guidelines
on Cardio-Oncology). [501] In patients with mild PH and a low-risk profile, discontinuing the trigger alone may be sufficient, and it is recommended that these patients be observed over 3–4 months before
considering PAH therapy. Pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy
should be initiated in patients who do not normalize their haemodynamics after withdrawing or in patients presenting with more advanced PAH at diagnosis. Unlike in other forms of PAH, de-escalation
of PAH therapy is often possible during the course of the disease. [500]

Physicians should bear in mind that DPAH may have features of
PVOD/PCH, especially in patients treated with alkylating agents
such as mitomycin C or cyclophosphamide. Health professional
awareness is essential in identifying cases of DPAH and reporting adverse effects of pharmaceutical products.

7.2. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
associated with connective tissue disease

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a well-known pulmonary vascular
complication of SSc, [173][,][502][–][504] systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), [505][–][507] mixed CTD, [506] and, rarely, dermatomyositis [508] and
Sjögren’s syndrome. [509] Conversely, the relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and PAH is not established. [510] After IPAH, PAH-CTD is
the second most prevalent type of PAH in western countries. [511]

Systemic sclerosis, particularly in its limited variant, represents the
main cause of PAH-CTD in Europe and the USA (SLE being more
common in Asia). [173][,][502][,][506] The prevalence of pre-capillary PH in large
cohorts of patients with SSc is 5–19%. [173][,][502] In these patients, PH may
occur in association with ILD [504][,][512] or as a result of PAH, [173][,][502][–][504][,][506]

sometimes with features of venous/capillary involvement. [504][,][513]

Moreover, group 2 PH-LHD is also common due to myocardial SSc
involvement. [504][,][514] Of note, patients with SLE may also present
with PAH, LHD, ILD, and CTEPH (mostly in the setting of antiphospholipid syndrome). It is therefore essential to carefully determine
which mechanism is operative in a given patient, since this will dictate

treatment in the context of a multifaceted disease.

Cluster analysis performed in patients with SSc has shown that
pre-capillary PH can be characterized into distinct clusters that differ
in prognosis. [503] One cluster, characterized by the presence of extensive ILD, and another by severely impaired haemodynamics carried a
dismal prognosis, while the two others showed either the absence of
ILD or the presence of limited ILD, with mild-to-moderate risk PAH
and a relatively favourable overall prognosis. [503]

7.2.1. Epidemiology and diagnosis
There is a strong female predominance in PAH-CTD (female/male
ratio 4:1), and mean age at diagnosis is commonly .50 years, especially in SSc. [173][,][502][–][511][,][513][,][515][,][516] In the setting of a CTD, patients may
present with concomitant disorders such as ILD, and have shorter
survival compared with patients with IPAH. [503] The unadjusted risk
of death for PAH-SSc compared with IPAH is 2.9, and the predictors
of outcome are broadly similar to those for IPAH. [516][,][517] Symptoms
and clinical presentation are also similar to IPAH, and some patients
thought to have IPAH can be identified as having an associated CTD
by careful clinical examination and immunological screening tests.
Chest CT is recommended for evaluating the presence of associated
ILD or PVOD/PCH. [504][,][513][,][515] An isolated reduction of DLCO is
common in PAH-CTD. [173][,][502][–][504]


Resting echocardiography combined with other tests is recommended as a screening test in asymptomatic patients with SSc, followed by annual assessments. Screening/early detection is discussed
in Section 5.3.1. In other CTDs, PH screening in the absence of suggestive symptoms is not recommended, while echocardiography
should be performed in the presence of symptoms. As in other forms
of PAH, RHC is recommended in all cases of suspected PAH-CTD to
confirm diagnosis, determine severity, and rule out LHD. [504]

7.2.2. Therapy
Drugs for PAH should be prescribed in PAH-CTD according to the
same treatment algorithm as in IPAH (Figure 9). Patients with
PAH-CTD have been included in most of the major RCTs for regulatory approval of PAH therapy. [518] Some aspects of PAH-CTD
treatment differ according to the associated CTD. [506]

Immunosuppressive therapy combining glucocorticosteroids and
cyclophosphamide may result in clinical improvement in patients
with SLE- or mixed CTD-associated PAH, [506] while it is not recommended in PAH-SSc. [519] Patients with SSc and other CTDs may have
ILD and/or HFpEF, which needs to be considered when initiating
PAH therapy. [504][,][515] In SSc, the long-term risk/benefit ratio of oral anticoagulation is unfavourable because of an increased risk of bleeding,
while VKAs are recommended in PAH-CTD with a thrombophilic
predisposition (e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome). [319]

Subgroup analyses of patients with PAH-SSc enrolled in RCTs performed with monotherapy or combination therapy of ERAs, PDE5is,
sGC stimulators, prostacyclin receptor agonists, epoprostenol, and
prostacyclin analogues have shown positive effects vs. placebo. [301][,][401][,][519][,][520] In some of these trials, the magnitude of the response in the PAH-CTD subgroup was lower than in the IPAH
subgroup. [519][,][520] Continuous i.v. epoprostenol therapy improved exercise capacity, symptoms, and haemodynamics in a 3-month RCT in
PAH-SSc. [401] However, a retrospective analysis showed a better effect of i.v. epoprostenol on survival in IPAH compared with
PAH-SSc. [521] The choice of PAH therapy in the context of SSc and
its systemic manifestations may consider other vascular damage
such as digital ulcers. [522]

Connective tissue disease should not be considered as an a priori
contraindication for LTx. [523] This has been extensively studied in SSc,
where a multidisciplinary approach optimizing SSc management before, during, and after surgery is recommended. [523] Indications and
contraindications for transplantation have to be adapted to the specificities of CTD, with a special focus on digestive (gastrooesophageal reflux disease and intestinal disease), cardiac, renal,
and cutaneous involvement. [523]

7.3. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
associated with human
immunodeficiency virus infection
The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and advances in managing opportunistic infections have contributed to increased life expectancy in patients with HIV. [525][,][526] Consequently,
the spectrum of complications has shifted towards other long-term
conditions, including PAH. Clinical and histopathological findings in
PAH associated with HIV infection (PAH-HIV) share many similarities with IPAH. [1][,][527] With the availability of HAART given in combination with PAH therapies, the prognosis of PAH-HIV has markedly
improved in recent years. [526][,][528] In addition, the incidence of
PAH-HIV has declined in parallel with the increasing availability of
HAART. [528] Taken together, these effects on survival and incidence
have resulted in a stable PAH prevalence in patients with HIV over
recent decades. A French population study indicated that the preva
lence of PAH in individuals with HIV infection was 0.46%, which is
very similar to the prevalence before the HAART era. [177]

The pathogenesis of PAH-HIV remains unclear. There is no evidence
of a direct role of HIV in the pathogenesis of PAH and, although present
in inflammatory cells in the lungs, the virus itself has never been found in
pulmonary vascular lesions of patients with PAH-HIV. [529] This suggests
that an indirect action of viral infection on inflammation and growth factors may act as a trigger in a predisposed patient.

7.3.1. Diagnosis
Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with HIV shares a clinical
presentation with IPAH. Before the availability of HAART most patients were in WHO-FC III or IV at diagnosis. Nowadays, patients are
diagnosed with much less severe symptoms and haemodynamics.
Patients may present with other risk factors for PAH such as liver disease (chronic viral hepatitis B or C) or exposure to drugs or toxins.
Patients with PAH-HIV are more likely to be male and i.v. drug abusers. [403][,][526] There is no correlation between the severity of PAH and
the stage of HIV infection or the degree of immunodeficiency. [403][,][530]

Because of its low prevalence, asymptomatic patients with HIV
should not be screened for PAH. However, echocardiography
should be performed in patients with unexplained dyspnoea to detect HIV-related cardiovascular complications such as myocarditis,
cardiomyopathy, or PAH. Right heart catheterization is mandatory
to confirm the diagnosis of PAH-HIV and to rule out LHD. [527]

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is an independent risk factor for
death in patients with HIV. In the 1990s, before the availability of
HAART, patients with PAH-HIV had poor outcomes, with a 3 year
survival of,50%. [403] The overall survival has now improved and patients with PAH-HIV have a better prognosis than most patients with
other forms of PAH. [526]


7.3.2. Therapy
Current recommendations for the treatment of PAH-HIV are largely
based on data from IPAH. [25][,][26]

Treatment of PAH-HIV with HAART has improved functional status and survival in some retrospective studies. [525][,][526][,][531] The use of
HAART in PAH-HIV is therefore recommended, irrespective of viral

load and CD4+ cell count.

Anticoagulation is not recommended because of an increased risk
of bleeding and drug interactions. [319][,][527] Patients with PAH-HIV are
usually non-responders to acute vasoreactivity testing and therefore
should not receive CCBs. [378]

The prospective, open-label, BREATHE-4 study showed that bosentan markedly improved WHO-FC, exercise capacity, quality of
life, and haemodynamics after 16 weeks in patients with
PAH-HIV. [532] In a long-term, retrospective series, bosentan therapy
was associated with haemodynamic normalization in 10/59 patients. [533] Bosentan potentially interacts with antiretroviral drugs,
and close monitoring is required when combined with HAART.
Very few patients with PAH-HIV have been included in RCTs with
ambrisentan and macitentan, and no definite conclusion can be

drawn from those studies.

Positive effects of sildenafil and tadalafil in PAH-HIV have been established in case studies. [534][,][535] Interactions have been reported between PDE5is and protease inhibitors, resulting in major increases
in PDE5i concentrations; these drugs should be introduced at low
dosages with careful monitoring of potential side effects, including
hypotension. [536][,][537] There are no data on the use of the sGC stimulator riociguat in PAH-HIV.
Treatment with i.v. epoprostenol resulted in significant improvement in WHO-FC, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, and survival
in selected patients with PAH-HIV. [403][,][538] There are very few data
on the use of i.v. or s.c. treprostinil or inhaled iloprost in
PAH-HIV. [539][,][540]

There are no clinical trial data on the use of combination therapy
for PAH-HIV. Given the lack of supporting evidence and potential
safety concerns when PAH drugs are co-administered with antiretroviral drugs, initial monotherapy with PAH medication is recommended, followed by an individualized use of combination therapy in
patients who do not reach a low-risk profile.

7.4. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
associated with portal hypertension
Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with portal hyperten
–
sion, commonly referred to as PoPH, develops in 2 6% of patients
with portal hypertension, with or without liver disease. In PAH regis
–
tries, PoPH represents 5 15% of the patients. [543][–][545] Rarely, some
patients with PoPH have portosystemic shunts in the absence of portal hypertension (congenital extrahepatic cavoportal shunts). [546]

However, PoPH is distinct from hepatopulmonary syndrome
(HPS), which is characterized by intrapulmonary vascular dilatations
and hypoxaemia. Of note, HPS and PoPH can occur sequentially or
concurrently in patients with portal hypertension. [547]

7.4.1. Diagnosis
The diagnosis of PoPH is based on the presence of otherwise unexplained pre-capillary PH in patients with portal hypertension or a portosystemic shunt. The diagnostic approach is the same as in other
patients with suspected or newly detected PH. Transthoracic echocardiography is usually the first non-invasive assessment in patients with
suspected PH, and echocardiography is also recommended as a screening tool in patients evaluated for liver transplantation. As patients with

liver disease often have an elevated CO, TRV tends to overestimate

PAP in these patients. Hence, RHC with comprehensive haemodynamic
assessment is essential to confirm the diagnosis of PH and to distinguish
PAH (with elevated PVR) from unclassified PH (with a normal PVR).

7.4.2. Therapy
Patients with unclassified PH (i.e. mPAP .20 mmHg, elevated CO,
and PVR ≤2.0 WU) should be regularly followed-up but should
not be treated with drugs approved for PAH.
In patients with an established diagnosis of PoPH, treatment
should follow the same general principles as in other patients with
PAH, taking into account the severity of underlying liver disease,
the indication for liver transplantation, and the potential effects of
PAH medication on gas exchange, which may deteriorate with vasodilators in patients with PoPH. [548][,][549] All drugs approved for PAH can
principally be used to treat patients with PoPH, bearing in mind that
these patients are usually excluded from registration studies.
Nevertheless, various case series support the use of approved
PAH medication in patients with PoPH. The largest series published
so far reported on 574 patients with PoPH treated with various PAH
drugs, mostly PDE5is or ERAs, alone and in combination. [545] Most pa
–
tients (56.8%) were in Child Pugh class A at the time of PAH diagnosis. At the first follow-up, which took place 4.5 months after
starting treatment, improvements were seen in haemodynamics,
WHO-FC, 6MWD, and BNP/NT-proBNP; survival at 5 years was
51%. In patients presenting with mild liver disease, the main causes
of death were PAH progression and malignancy, whereas complications of liver disease were the most common causes of death in patients with advanced liver disease. The 5 year survival of patients who
underwent liver transplantation (n = 63) was 81%.
The only RCT dedicated to the treatment of PoPH was PORTICO,
a 12 week study that randomized 85 patients to macitentan (n = 43)
or placebo (n = 42). [168] PORTICO met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant reduction in PVR from baseline (ratio of geometric mean 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59–0.72; P, 0.0001). There were, however,


no differences between the two treatment groups in secondary outcome measures, including WHO-FC, 6MWD, and NT-proBNP.

7.4.2.1. Liver transplantation
Porto-pulmonary hypertension is not per se an indication for liver
transplantation. Pulmonary arterial hypertension poses a major threat
to patients who undergo liver transplantation when indicated for the
severity of liver disease. In a historical series from the Mayo Clinic, severe PAH with mPAP ≥50 mmHg was associated with a 100% peri
–
operative mortality rate. In patients with mPAP 35 50 mmHg and
PVR .3.0 WU, mortality was still 50%. [550] In liver transplantation candidates with PAH, targeted medical therapy successfully improves
haemodynamics and establishes eligibility for transplantation. [545][,][551][–]

554 However, haemodynamic criteria for successful liver transplantation have not been firmly established. The International Liver
Transplant Society proposed haemodynamic targets of mPAP
,35 mmHg and PVR,5 WU, or mPAP ≥35 mmHg and PVR,3
WU in patients receiving PAH therapy, while acknowledging that
these criteria need to be further validated. [175] An mPAP ≥45 mmHg
is regarded as an absolute contraindication to liver transplantation. [175]

In patients with PoPH who successfully underwent liver transplantation, de-escalation or discontinuation of PAH medication is often feasible, but this has to be performed on an individual basis. [551][,][554]

7.5. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
associated with adult congenital heart
disease

The presence of PH in adults with CHD has a negative impact on the

natural course of CHD, and worsens clinical status and overall outcome. [555] Pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with adult CHD
is included in group 1 of the PH clinical classification (Table 6) and represents a heterogeneous patient population. Post-capillary PH in adult
CHD (e.g. systolic or diastolic, systemic, ventricular dysfunction in combination with shunt lesions or complex adult CHD, and systemic atrioventricular valve dysfunction) should be excluded to determine further
management. A specific clinical classification (Table 21) is provided to
better characterize PAH associated with adult CHD. Some complex
CHDs are associated with congenital abnormalities of the pulmonary
vascular tree leading to segmental PH. In segmental PH, one or more,
but not all, segments of the lung(s) are hypertensive and each hypertensive area may present with PH of different severity, while other parts of
the lung vasculature may be hypoplastic. Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and systemic-to-pulmonary collaterals is the

Table 21 Clinical classification of pulmonary arterial
hypertension associated with congenital heart disease

(1) Eisenmenger syndrome

Includes all large intra- and extracardiac defects that begin as

systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and progress to severely elevated

PVR and to reverse (pulmonary-to-systemic) or bidirectional

shunting. Cyanosis, secondary erythrocytosis, and multiple organ

involvement are usually present. Closing the defects is

contraindicated.

(2) PAH associated with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts

   - Correctable [a]

   - Non-correctable

Include moderate-to-large defects. PVR is mildly to moderately

increased and systemic-to-pulmonary shunting is still prevalent,

whereas cyanosis at rest is not a feature.

(3) PAH with small/coincidental [b] defects

Markedly elevated PVR in the presence of cardiac defects considered

haemodynamically non-significant (usually ventricular septal defects

,1 cm and atrial septal defects,2 cm of effective diameter

assessed by echocardiography), which themselves do not account

for the development of elevated PVR. The clinical picture is very

similar to IPAH. Closing the defects is contraindicated.

(4) PAH after defect correction

Congenital heart disease is repaired, but PAH either persists

immediately after correction or recurs/develops months or years
after correction in the absence of significant, post-operative,

haemodynamic lesions.

be considered.


most frequent condition, but other complex CHDs may also lead to
segmental PH.

–
Approximately 3 7% of patients with adult CHD will eventually
develop PAH; it is more frequently encountered in females, and
the incidence depends on the underlying lesion and increases with
age and age at defect closure. [556] The estimated prevalence of PAH
in patients after correcting a simple cardiac defect is 3%. [557] The epidemiology of PAH associated with adult CHD is expected to change
due to advances in diagnostic and therapeutic paediatric cardiology,
resulting in fewer patients with simple adult CHD and more patients
with complex lesions and/or closed defects who develop PAH in
adulthood. [558]

The clinical presentation of Eisenmenger syndrome, an advanced
form of adult CHD-associated PAH, is characterized by the multiorgan
effects of chronic hypoxaemia, including cyanosis, and haematological
changes, including secondary erythrocytosis and thrombocytopenia;
the main symptoms are dyspnoea, fatigue, and syncope. Eisenmenger
syndrome may also present with haemoptysis, chest pain, cerebrovascular accidents, brain abscesses, coagulation abnormalities, and sudden
death. Patients with adult CHD and Down syndrome are at an increased risk of developing Eisenmenger syndrome.

7.5.1. Diagnosis and risk assessment
The diagnostic work-up of PAH associated with adult CHD should
be based on the presence of symptoms and includes medical history, physical examination, PFTs, ABG, imaging (especially echocardiography), and exercise and laboratory testing. Of note, standard
echocardiographic criteria for detecting PH may not be applicable
in complex adult CHD. [559] Right heart catheterization with compartmental oximetry for calculating pulmonary blood flow/systemic blood flow (Qp/Qs) is required to confirm PAH diagnosis and
guide therapeutic interventions. Thermodilution should be avoided
in the presence of intracardiac shunts, and direct Fick is the most
accurate method. Pulmonary vascular resistance may be overestimated due to erythrocytosis. [560] Interpreting invasive haemodynamics (see Section 5.1.12) should be made in the context of
multiparametric assessment of exercise capacity, laboratory testing, and imaging.

Predictors of worse outcomes in adult CHD-associated PAH are

WHO-FC III–IV, exercise intolerance assessed by 6MWD or peak
VO 2, history of hospitalization for right HF, biomarkers (NT-proBNP
.500 pg/mL, C-reactive protein .10 mg/mL, high serum creatinine,
and low albumin levels), iron deficiency, and echocardiographic indices
of RV dysfunction. [559][,][561] When compared with patients with IPAH, patients with Eisenmenger syndrome may have a relatively stable longterm clinical course. The right ventricle is unloaded by the right-to-left
shunt, sustaining CO at the expense of hypoxaemia and cyanosis.
However, due to immortal time bias, prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome is not as favourable as previously thought. [562]

As in other forms of PAH, risk assessment is important to guide
therapy, and specific risk factors have been described in Eisenmenger
syndrome. A large multicentre study showed that mortality in adults
with Eisenmenger syndrome was predicted by the presence of pretricuspid shunt, advancing age, low rest oxygen saturation, absence of
sinus rhythm, and presence of pericardial effusion. [563]

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3679


7.5.2. Therapy
Outcomes in adult CHD-associated PAH have improved with the
availability of new PAH therapies, advances in surgical and perioperative management, and a team-based, multidisciplinary approach in PH centres. These patients should be managed by specialized health professionals. Patient education, behavioural
modifications, and social and psychological support are all important
aspects of management.
Shunt closure (surgical or interventional) may only be considered in patients with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunting
without significantly increased PVR. Criteria for defect closure
based on Qp/Qs ratio and (baseline and/or after targeted PAH
treatment) PVR have been proposed by the 2020 ESC
Guidelines for the management of adult congenital heart disease. [101] Decisions on shunt closure should not be made on

haemodynamic numbers alone, and a multiparametric strategy

should be followed. For instance, shunt closure is not indicated

in the case of desaturation during exercise in the 6MWT or
CPET, or when there is secondary erythrocytosis suggesting dynamic reversal of shunt. There is no evidence for a long-term
benefit of a treat-and-repair approach in patients with adult
CHD-associated PAH with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary
shunts; therefore, there is a need for future prospective studies. [564] Defect closure is contraindicated in all patients with
Eisenmenger syndrome, and may also adversely affect patients
with small/coincidental defects that behave similarly to IPAH. [565]

There are no prospective data available on the usefulness of vasoreactivity testing, balloon closure testing, or lung biopsy for assessing operability and normalization of PVR after closure. [566]

Patients with adult CHD-associated PAH may present with clinical
deterioration in different circumstances, such as arrhythmia, during
non-cardiac surgery requiring general anaesthesia, dehydration or
bleeding, thrombo-embolism, and lung infections. Surgeries should
be limited to those deemed essential, and performed in specialized
centres with anaesthetists experienced in adult CHD and PAH.
Endocarditis should be suspected in patients with sepsis, whereas a
cerebral abscess should be excluded in those with neurological
symptoms or new headache, especially in those with low oxygen saturations and complex anatomies. It is recommended to avoid

strenuous exercise, but mild and moderate activities seem to be
beneficial. [567] Patients should receive all recommended vaccinations
and endocarditis prophylaxis in the presence of cyanosis. Although
pregnant patients with left-to-right shunts and stable, well-controlled
PAH have tolerated pregnancy well under specialized care, pregnancy is still associated with both high maternal mortality and foetal
complications in Eisenmenger syndrome and should be discouraged
in this setting; [568][,][569] hence, effective contraception is highly recommended. Levonorgestrel-based, long-acting, reversible contraception implants or intrauterine devices have been recommended for
these patients. [570]

Secondary erythrocytosis is beneficial for adequate oxygen transport and delivery, and routine phlebotomy should be avoided whenever possible. Symptoms of hyperviscosity in the presence of
haematocrit .65% should be approached with appropriate hydration. Iron deficiency should be corrected. When i.v. iron supplementation is administered, special care should be taken to avoid air


emboli during administration. [571] Supplemental oxygen therapy has
not been shown to impact survival.
Oral anticoagulant treatment with VKAs may be considered in patients with large PA aneurysms with thrombus, atrial arrhythmias,
and previous thrombo-embolic events, but with low bleeding risk.
In patients with very high Hb levels (.20 mg/dL), standard inter
national normalized ratio measures are less accurate, and

citrate-adjusted blood bottles must be used. Regarding using novel
oral anticoagulants (NOACs), a large, nationwide, German, adult
CHD database (including 106 NOAC-treated patients with
Eisenmenger syndrome) showed that NOAC users had higher longterm risk of bleeding, major adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality compared with those on VKAs, suggesting that initiating
NOACs should be reserved for experienced adult CHD centres,
carefully weighing potential benefits and risks. [572][,][573]

Compared with other group 1 subgroups, limited data exist on the
use of drugs approved for PAH in patients with adult CHD-associated
PAH. Bosentan improved 6MWD and decreased PVR in patients with
Eisenmenger syndrome in WHO-FC III. [574] Patients with more complex lesions were less likely to respond to PAH therapies compared
with patients with simple lesions. An RCT investigating the efficacy of
macitentan found no effect on 6MWD in a mixed cohort of patients
with Eisenmenger syndrome (6MWD improved in both treatment
and placebo arms), although decreases in NT-proBNP and PVR
were noted in the macitentan arm. [575]

Experiences with other ERAs and PDE5is have shown favourable
functional and haemodynamic results in Eisenmenger syndrome. [576]

In a small, single-centre, pilot study, adding nebulized iloprost to a
background of oral PAH therapy failed to improve 6MWD in
Eisenmenger syndrome. [577] In case symptoms persist or in clinical deterioration, a sequential and symptom-orientated treatment strategy
is recommended in Eisenmenger syndrome, starting with an oral
ERA (or PDE5i) and escalating therapy. Should symptoms not adequately improve with oral therapies, i.v./s.c. options should be proactively considered. [578] There is a theoretical risk of paradoxical
embolism in right-to-left shunt lesions with the presence of a central
venous catheter for i.v. therapy; therefore, s.c. prostacyclin analogue
infusion may be considered.
The effect of PAH therapies in patients with prevalent
systemic-to-pulmonary shunts is less well established. Patients with

small/coincidental defects should be treated with PAH medication. [557] This is also the case for patients with PAH after defect correction who have increased mortality compared with those with
Eisenmenger syndrome. [579] These patients were included in major
RCTs with PAH therapies and should be evaluated based on comprehensive risk assessment (Table 16). [580] The effect of PAH therapies in patients with segmental PH remains a matter of debate. [101][,][581]

While some series have reported promising results, there have been
cases where therapies were not tolerated. [581] Similarly, using PAH
therapies in Fontan circulation has yielded conflicting results, and results of further studies are awaited. [582][–][584]

Heart–lung transplantation or LTx with heart surgery is an option
in highly selected cases not responsive to medical treatment; however, it is limited by organ availability and lesion complexity.
Mortality is high during the first year after surgery, especially after
heart–lung transplantation, but remains relatively low thereafter. [585]

7.6. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
associated with schistosomiasis

Schistosomiasis is one of the most common chronic infectious diseases worldwide, affecting around 200 million people. [586][,][587]

Schistosomiasis-associated PAH is present in 5% of patients with
the hepatosplenic form of the disease. [586] It is thus a leading cause
of PAH, especially in some regions of South America, Africa, and
Asia. Compared with patients with IPAH, patients with
schistosomiasis-associated PAH present with higher CO and lower
PVR, and have a better survival. [587] Registry data suggest that survival
in schistosomiasis-associated PAH has improved in recent years with
the use of PAH drugs. [588]

7.7. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
with signs of venous/capillary
involvement

The common risk factors, identical genetic substrate, and indistinguishable clinical presentations of PCH and PVOD necessitate their
consideration as a single disease belonging to the group 1 PH spectrum of diseases (PAH with signs of venous/capillary involvement). [1][,][425][,][589] In PVOD/PCH, post-capillary lesions affecting septal
veins and pre-septal venules consist of loose, fibrous remodelling
of the intima that may totally occlude the lumen. [1][,][425][,][589][,][590] These
changes are frequently associated with PCH consisting of capillary

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3681


ectasia and proliferation, with doubling and tripling of the alveolar
septal capillary layers that may be focally distributed within the alveolar interstitium. [425][,][590]

The proportion of patients with IPAH that fulfil the criteria for
PVOD/PCH is ≏10%, resulting in a lowest estimate of PVOD/PCH
incidence and prevalence of,1 case/million. [425] In contrast to
IPAH, there is a male predominance in PVOD/PCH and its prognosis is worse. [425][,][589][,][591] Familial PVOD/PCH typically occurs in the
young siblings of one generation, with unaffected and sometimes
consanguineous parents, indicating that the disease segregates as
a recessive trait. [158][,][425][,][591] Biallelic mutations in the EIF2AK4 gene
cause heritable PVOD/PCH. [158] In addition, PVOD/PCH can complicate the course of associated conditions, such as SSc, [425] or be
associated with exposure to environmental triggers, such as alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, mitomycin C) [34] and solvents
(trichloroethylene). [38]

7.7.1. Diagnosis
Most patients complain of non-specific dyspnoea on exertion and fatigue. [590] Physical examination may reveal digital clubbing and bibasal
crackles on lung auscultation. [590] Pulmonary arterial hypertension
and PVOD/PCH share the same haemodynamic profile as precapillary PH. [590][,][591] The PAWP is not elevated because the pulmonary vascular changes occur in small venulae and capillaries, while the
LA filling pressure remains normal. [590][,][591] A diagnosis of PVOD/PCH
is based on the results of tests suggesting venous post-capillary involvement, chronic interstitial pulmonary oedema, and capillary
proliferation. [1][,][590][,][591] These tests include PFTs (decreased DLCO,
frequently,50% theoretical values), ABG (hypoxaemia), and
non-contrast chest CT (subpleural thickened septal lines, centrilobular ground-glass opacities, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy). [1][,][425][,][589][,][591][,][592] Importantly, these patients are at risk of
drug-induced pulmonary oedema with PAH therapy, a finding suggestive of PVOD/PCH. [425][,][591] Detecting biallelic EIF2AK4 mutations
is sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of heritable PVOD/
PCH. [158][,][591][,][592] Lung biopsy is hazardous in PH and is not recommended for diagnosing PVOD/PCH. [1][,][425]

7.7.2. Therapy
There is no established medical therapy for PVOD/PCH. [425]

Compared with IPAH, PVOD/PCH has a poor prognosis and limited
response to PAH therapy, with a risk of pulmonary oedema due to
pulmonary venous obstruction. [425][,][591] However, there are reports of
incomplete and transient clinical improvement in individual patients
with PVOD/PCH treated with PAH therapy, which should be
used with great caution in this setting. [425][,][591] Diuretics, oxygen
therapy, and slow titration of PAH therapy can be used on an individual basis. [425] Therefore, therapy for PVOD/PCH should be
undertaken at centres with extensive experience in managing
PH, and patients should be fully informed about the risks. [425]

Anecdotal reports suggest a potential benefit of immunomodulatory treatments, but this approach requires further study. [593]

The only curative therapy for PVOD/PCH is LTx, and eligible patients should be referred to a transplant centre for evaluation
upon diagnosis. [425][,][591] Pathological examination of the explanted
lungs will confirm the diagnosis. [590]

7.8. Paediatric pulmonary hypertension
Pulmonary hypertension may present at all ages, including in infants
and children. Pulmonary hypertension in childhood shares many

common features with PH in adulthood; however, there are also im
portant differences, which concern epidemiology, aetiology, genetic
background, age-dependent diagnostic and treatment approaches,
and disease monitoring. An important and conceptually distinctive
feature of paediatric PH is injury to developing foetal, neonatal, or
paediatric lung circulation.

7.8.1. Epidemiology and classification
The reported annual incident rate for paediatric PH is 64/million children. [594] The distribution of the various aetiologies of PH in childhood differs from PH in adulthood. [594][–][596] Pulmonary arterial
hypertension is the most frequent type of PH in children, with the
vast majority (82%) of cases being infants with transient PAH (i.e.
PPHN or repairable cardiac shunt defects). Of the remaining children

with PAH, most have either IPAH, HPAH, or irreversible

CHD-associated PAH. The reported incidences of IPAH/HPAH
and (non-transient) CHD-associated PAH are 0.7 and 2.2/million
children, respectively, with a prevalence of 4.4 and 15.6/million children, respectively. [594] Other conditions associated with PAH
(Table 6) do occur in children but are rare.

–
Another significant proportion (34 49%) of children with non
transient PH are neonates and infants with PH associated with re
spiratory disease, especially developmental lung diseases, including
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), congenital diaphragmatic hernia
(CDH), and congenital pulmonary vascular abnormalities. [594][–][598]

These children form a prominent and distinctive group in paediatric
PH and are currently classified as PH group 3 associated with

growing proportion of children with PH associated with respiratory
disease is made up of pre-term infants with BPD. Also, newly recog
—
nized genetic developmental lung disorders including alveolar capillary dysplasia, TBX4-mutation-related lung disorders, and surfactant
abnormalities—are currently classified in this category (Figure 10). [599]


Another distinctive feature of PH in children is the high burden of
genetic disorders. Childhood PH is often associated with chromo
–
somal, genetic, and syndromic anomalies (11 52%). Like in adults,
gene mutations implicated in the pathogenesis of HPAH are found
in 20–30% of sporadic cases, where paediatric HPAH seems to be
characterized by an enrichment in TBX4 and ACVRL1

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3683


variations. [600][,][601] Additionally, 17% of children with PAH have other
disorders known to be associated with PAH, including trisomy 21.
Finally, 23% of children with PAH have copy number variations not
previously associated with PH. [600][,][602][,][603]

Given the frequent association of paediatric PAH with chromosomal, genetic, and syndromic anomalies (for which the mechanistic
basis for PAH is generally uncertain), genetic testing may be considered for defining aetiology and comorbidities, stratifying risk, and
identifying family members at risk; however, this should be after
appropriate expert genetic counselling for the child and family (see
Section 5.1.13).
The clinical PH classification (Table 6) is also followed for paediatric PH. To improve applicability of this classification in infants and
children with PH, it has been adapted to give room to PH associated
with various congenital cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases or
[specific paediatric conditions (Tables S5–S8).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data) [599]

7.8.2. Diagnosis and risk assessment
Historically, the definition of PH in children aged .3 months has
been the same as in adults. The definition for PH has now been redefined to mPAP .20 mmHg in adults as well as in children. The im
–
pact of an mPAP 21 24 mmHg on outcomes in children is unknown.
However, in the interest of consistency and to facilitate transition
from paediatric to adult PH care, it is recommended that the updated
definition for PH also be followed in children. No treatment recom
–
mendations currently exist for this group of children (mPAP 21
24 mmHg).
Regarding the newly introduced criterion to include PVR .2 WU
to identify pre-capillary PH in adults, PVR had previously been included in the definition for PAH in children. In children, blood flows
are traditionally indexed assuming that systemic and pulmonary
blood flows change proportionally with body size, while the transpulmonary pressure gradient does not. Since blood flow is the denominator in the equation for calculating PVR, the need for indexing of
PVR in children is emphasized, and the criterion of pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) ≥3 WU·m [2] in the definition for PAH in
children remains unchanged. [599]

Since the aetiology of paediatric PH is very diverse, a methodical
and comprehensive diagnostic approach is crucial to reach an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. As in adults, IPAH is a diagnosis ‘per
exclusion’. A diagnostic work-up, similar to that in adults but customized for paediatric PH, is recommended. [599] Pre-term infants with
BPD should be screened for PH, since PH is prevalent in this population and seriously affects outcome. [604]

Also in children, RHC is the gold standard for definitively diagnosing
and establishing the nature of PH, and provides important data for
stratifying risk. [604a][,][605] To identify those suitable for high-dose CCB
treatment, acute vasoreactivity testing is recommended in children
with IPAH/HPAH. The criteria used in adults for a positive acute response have identified children who will show sustained benefit from
CCB therapy; however, these criteria do not define reversibility of
PAH or operability in children with CHD. Since RHC in children
with PH may be associated with major complications (in 1–3% of
cases, especially in young infants and those in worse clinical condition),
risks and benefits have to be balanced in the individual child. [605] Heart
catheterization in children with PAH should be exclusively performed


in experienced paediatric PH centres. Indications for repeated RHC in
children with PH are currently not well defined.
Treatment of children with PAH is based on risk stratification. [599]

Predictors of worse outcome in paediatric PAH are similar to those
in adults, and include clinical evidence of RV failure, progression of

–
symptoms, WHO-FC III IV, certain echocardiographic parameters
(e.g. TAPSE), and elevated serum NT-proBNP. A 6MWD,350 m
has also been suggested as a predictor of worse outcome in paediatric PH, but its value in young children is less established. Further prognosticators identified in paediatric PAH are failure to thrive and
haemodynamic variables, such as RAP .10 mmHg, the ratio of
mean pulmonary-to-systemic blood pressure .0.75, and PVRI
.20 WU·m [2] . [602][,][606][,][607] Paediatric risk-assessment tools based on

these parameters have been retrospectively validated in observational paediatric registries. [599][,][604a]

7.8.3. Therapy
The ultimate goal of treatment should be to improve survival and fa
cilitate normal childhood activities without limitations. In the absence

of RCTs in paediatric PAH, recommended treatment algorithms are
extrapolated from those in adults and enhanced with data from observational studies in children with PAH. [599]

Observational cohort studies support treatment algorithms designed for adults to be used for children (including the superiority
of combination therapy over monotherapy). [608] Drugs investigated
in children, with or without formal approval by the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) for treating children with PAH, are shown

in Table 22.

A paediatric treatment algorithm, derived from that for adults, is
based on risk stratification, recommending general measures, highdose CCB therapy for responders to acute vasoreactivity testing
(where close follow-up is mandatory, as some patients may fail longterm therapy), oral or inhaled combination therapy for children at
low risk, and combination therapy with i.v./s.c. prostacyclin analogues
for those at high risk. [599]

In the case of insufficient response to recommended drug therapy,
or when drugs are unavailable, a Potts shunt (a surgical or interventional connection between the left PA and the descending aorta),
BAS, or LTx may be considered in children with severe PH (see
Sections 6.3.6.1 and 6.3.8). [599] Reported clinical experience with
Potts shunts is limited to just over 100 patients, predominantly children, with a mortality of 12–25% and long-term clinical benefit in a
subset of children with long-term follow-up. [456][–][459]

Monitoring of treatment effect and disease course is pivotal in
managing all patients with PAH (adults and in children). In children
with PAH, clinical risk scores including WHO-FC, TAPSE, and serum
NT-proBNP are potential treatment targets for goal-orientated
treatment. [604a][,][609]

Contemporary treatment algorithms for infants with PPHN have
been proposed but are outside the scope of these guidelines. [610]

The recommendations discussed above apply to children with
PAH, whereas the specific group of infants with neonatal PVD, mostly classified as PH associated with developmental lung disease and
with heterogeneous aetiology, require a distinct and customized approach (Figure 10).
In pre-term infants with BPD and PH, the underlying lung disease
should primarily be treated. Frequently, these infants are additionally

### 8. Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease (group 2)

8.1. Definition, prognosis, and
pathophysiology
Among patients with LHD, PH and RV dysfunction are frequently
present and associated with high mortality. [47] This includes patients
with HF with reduced, mildly reduced, or preserved ejection fraction
(HFrEF, HFmrEF, or HFpEF), left-sided valvular heart disease, and
congenital/acquired cardiovascular conditions leading to postcapillary PH. [13][,][631][–][635] Arguably, PH-LHD represents the most prevalent form of PH, accounting for 65–80% of cases. [47]

Consistent with the general definitions of PH, PH-LHD (group 2
PH) is defined by an mPAP .20 mmHg and a PAWP .15 mmHg.
Within this haemodynamic condition of post-capillary PH, IpcPH is
defined by PVR ≤2 WU and CpcPH by PVR .2 WU (Table 5).
The diastolic pressure gradient (DPG) (calculated as the difference
between dPAP and PAWP) is no longer used to distinguish between
IpcPH and CpcPH because of conflicting data on prognostication in
LHD. [142]

Across the spectrum of LHD, increases in PAP and PVR are asso
ciated with an increased disease burden and a worse outcome. [13][,][631][,][633][,][635] In a large patient cohort—predominantly with
post-capillary PH—a PVR ≥2.2 WU was associated with adverse
outcomes and considered abnormal. [13] However, even within this

subgroup of patients with LHD and CpcPH, the risk of mortality increases with progressive elevation in PVR. In patients with advanced
HFrEF and those with HFpEF or valvular heart disease, a PVR
.5 WU carries additional prognostic information and is considered
clinically meaningful by physicians. [142][,][450][,][631][–][639] Elevated PVR also
appears to be associated with decreased survival in special situations,
such as in patients undergoing interventions for correcting valvular
heart disease, [634] heart transplantation, [142][,][633] or LVAD implantation. [142][,][637] Based on available data, a PVR .5 WU may indicate a
severe pre-capillary component, the presence of which may prompt
physicians to refer patients to PH centres for specialized care.
The prevalence of PH in patients with LHD is difficult to assess and
depends on the methodology of diagnostic testing (echocardiography or invasive haemodynamics), cut-off values used to define
PH, and populations studied. Observational studies suggest an esti
–
mated prevalence of PH of 40 72% in patients with HFrEF and
36–83% in those with HFpEF. [48][,][639][–][643] When PVR is used to define

a pre-capillary component in patients with HF and post-capillary PH,
≏20–30% of patients are categorized as having CpcPH. [47][,][644][,][645] In
patients with valvular heart disease, echocardiographic studies have
shown that PH is present in up to 65% of patients with symptomatic
aortic stenosis, [646][–][651] while virtually all patients with severe mitral


valve stenosis develop PH, [652] which can also be found in most patients with significant degenerative or functional mitral regurgitation.
The pathophysiology of PH-LHD combines several mechanisms
(Figure 11): (1) an initial passive increase in LV filling pressures and
backward transmission into the pulmonary circulation; (2) PA

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3687


endothelial dysfunction (including vasoconstriction); (3) vascular remodelling (which may occur in both venules and/or arterioles); (4)
RV dilatation/dysfunction and functional TR; [653][–][656] and (5) altered
RV–PA coupling. [655][–][657] The haemodynamic profile of CpcPH vs.
IpcPH and elevated PVR reflects pulmonary vascular abnormalities,
which contribute to an increased RV afterload. Resulting dysfunction
of the RV is frequent and associated with a worse prognosis in patients with PH-LHD. In HFpEF, where RV dysfunction may occur
[via distinct mechanisms (Figure S1), deterioration of RV, but not LV](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
systolic function, has been observed over time, and both prevalent
and incident RV dysfunction are predictors of mortality. [658]

The occurrence of PH in patients with LHD may also be due to
other causes, including undetected CTEPH or PAH. Further, respiratory comorbidities such as COPD and sleep apnoea are also common in patients with LHD and may contribute to PH and impact
prognosis. Patients with HFpEF and PH associated with HFpEF [75][,][76]

may also present with a low DLCO, which is an independent predictor of outcome. [75]

8.2. Diagnosis
In patients with LHD, symptoms (e.g. exertional dyspnoea) and physical signs of PH (e.g. peripheral oedema) frequently overlap with
those of the underlying left heart condition and are mostly nonspecific. However, while pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion
indicate LHD as the underlying cause of PH, other features may suggest the presence of relevant PH (see Section 5.1.1).
Routine diagnostic tests including BNP/NT-proBNP, ECG, and
echocardiography may show signs of underlying LHD, but may also
indicate PH. While BNP/NT-proBNP cannot discriminate between
left- or right-sided HF, ECG findings such as right axis deviation or
RV strain may suggest the presence of PH in patients with LHD.
Echocardiography can diagnose HFrEF and HFpEF; identify specific
cardiac conditions, including those with restrictive filling pattern;
and diagnose additional valvular heart disease; it may also detect elevated sPAP and other features of PH (RA area, PA enlargement, RV/
LV ratio, LV eccentricity index, RV forming the apex), leading to an
echocardiographic probability of PH (see Section 5.1.5). A stepwise,
composite echocardiographic score may discriminate pre- vs. postcapillary PH and predict PVD in patients with LHD. [659][,][660]

Additional information may be gathered from further testing, including biomarkers, imaging-derived markers of RV dysfunction, and
CPET-derived variables. [142]

Given the complexity and variability of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in patients with LHD, the distinction between post- and
pre-capillary PH and the diagnosis of PH-LHD vs. other forms of
PH can be challenging. Diagnostic clues in the evaluation of suspected
PH in LHD include: (1) diagnosis and control of the underlying LHD;
(2) evaluation for PH and patient phenotyping; and (3) invasive
haemodynamic evaluation, when indicated.

8.2.1. Diagnosis and control of the underlying left
heart disease

Patients with suspected PH-LHD will have an established diagnosis of
LHD, such as HFrEF/HFmrEF, HFpEF, valvular heart disease, and/or
CHD. The distinction between PH associated with HFpEF and other
forms of PH (e.g. PAH, CTEPH) may be challenging, particularly given

the increased burden of cardiovascular comorbidities in real-world


PAH populations. [142][,][450][,][661] In this context, validated scores for
diagnosing HFpEF (HFA-PEFF, H2FPEF) [16][,][662][,][663] may be helpful for
detecting it as an underlying condition in PH, and the presence or ab
sence of risk factors for PAH or CTEPH should be determined.

Patients with signs of predominant RV strain and/or PH should be

further evaluated. Patients should be assessed or reassessed when

they are fully recompensated and in a clinically stable condition.

8.2.2. Evaluation of pulmonary hypertension and
patient phenotyping
Patients with LHD and suspected PH should be evaluated following
the diagnostic strategy for PH (see Section 5). This requires identifying clinical features and a multimodal approach using non-invasive
diagnostic tests such as echocardiography, ECG, and BNP/
NT-proBNP levels. In the presence of mild PH and predominant
LHD, no further testing may be necessary. Otherwise, CTEPH and
significant lung disease should be ruled out by V/Q scan and PFTs,
and additional cardiac imaging including cMRI may be considered in
selected cases. For phenotyping, a combination of variables may
help to determine the likelihood of LHD, and HFpEF in particular,
vs. other causes of PH (Table 23). Pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease is likely in the presence of known cardiac disease, multiple cardiovascular comorbidities/risk factors, atrial
fibrillation at diagnosis, and specific imaging findings (LV hypertrophy,
increased LA size, and reduced LA strain). Although exercise echocardiography has been proposed to uncover HFpEF, it is unable to
diagnose or classify PH in this context. A combination of clinical findings and phenotyping is required to decide about the need for further

invasive assessment.

8.2.3. Invasive assessment of haemodynamics
The decision to perform cardiac catheterization and to invasively assess cardiopulmonary haemodynamics should depend on the presence of an intermediate to high echocardiographic probability of
PH, and should be determined by the need to obtain relevant information for prognostication or management. In patients with a high

likelihood of LHD as the main cause of PH, or with established

underlying LHD and mild PH (Table 23), invasive assessment for
PH is usually not indicated. Indications for RHC in LHD include:
(1) suspected PAH or CTEPH; (2) suspected CpcPH with a severe
pre-capillary component, where further information will aid pheno[typing and treatment decisions (Figure S2); and (3) advanced HF and](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
evaluation for heart transplantation. While several haemodynamic
measures (mPAP, PVR, pulmonary arterial compliance [PAC], transpulmonary pressure gradient, and DPG) are associated with outcomes in PH-LHD, [142][,][632][,][635] the most robust and consistent data

are available for PVR. Invasive assessment should be conducted in ex
perienced centres, when management of the underlying LHD has
been optimized and patients are in a clinically stable condition.
With respect to respiratory variations of intrathoracic pressures,
all pressure readings should be taken at end-expiration.
Additional testing during RHC may be useful for distinguishing between PAH and HFpEF, [18][,][23][,][664][–][669] and to uncover LHD in patients

with a rapid increase in PAWP when challenged with increased systemic venous return. [674] While the upper limit of normal remains
controversial, [142][,][143][,][665][,][667] a PAWP cut-off of .18 mmHg has
been suggested to identify HFpEF as the underlying cause of PH, despite normal PAWP at baseline. [143] While this may help to classify PH,
therapeutic consequences of such testing remain to be determined.
As differentiating between severe PH associated with HFpEF and
IPAH with cardiac comorbidities is challenging, patients with an unclear diagnosis, particularly those with a predominant pre-capillary
component (e.g. PVR .5 WU), should be referred to a PH centre
for individualized management.

8.3. Therapy
The primary strategy in managing PH-LHD is optimizing treatment of
the underlying cardiac disease. Nevertheless, a pathophysiological sequence ranging from left-sided heart disease via pulmonary circulation to chronic right heart strain (at rest or exercise) is present in
many patients. [47] Since deterioration of RV function over time is associated with poor outcomes in HFpEF, [658] preserving RV function
should be considered an important treatment goal. Diuretics remain
the cornerstone of medical therapy in the presence of fluid retention

due to PH-LHD.

There is limited and conflicting evidence for the use of drugs approved for PAH in patients with group 2 PH. Some medications


may have variable and potentially detrimental effects in such patients
and are therefore not indicated in PH-LHD. Management strategies
for PH in various left heart aetiologies are described below.

8.3.1. Pulmonary hypertension associated with
left-sided heart failure

8.3.1.1. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
Patients with HFrEF or HFmrEF require guideline-directed treatment including established medical and interventional therapies. [27]

                                         In patients with advanced HFrEF, implanting an LVAD may signifi
cantly reduce or even normalize mPAP, [675] although this is not
achieved in all patients, [676] and an increased DPG emerged as a negative prognostic factor after LVAD implantation. [677] With regards to
PAH drugs, bosentan was assessed in an RCT of patients with PH
associated with HFrEF, [678] showing no efficacy but an increase in
adverse events compared with placebo, predominantly related to
fluid retention. Small studies have suggested that sildenafil
may improve haemodynamics and exercise capacity in PH and
HFrEF, [679][–][681] but RCTs are lacking.

8.3.1.2. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
In patients with HFpEF, blood pressure, volume load, and risk factors
should be controlled, which may lower filling pressures and PAP. [27]

Recently, the SGLT-2i empagliflozin improved outcomes in patients

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3689


with an LV ejection fraction of 40–60%. [682] Endothelin receptor antagonists have not proved successful in this population, as both bosentan [683] and macitentan [684] failed to show efficacy but rather led
to more adverse events (fluid retention) vs. placebo in patients
with HFpEF-associated PH and HF with ejection fraction
.35%-associated CpcPH, respectively. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors were assessed in two small RCTs in patients with HFpEF and
PH with distinct haemodynamic characteristics. In patients with a
predominantly IpcPH profile, sildenafil had no effect on mPAP (primary endpoint) or other haemodynamic and clinical measures vs.
placebo. [685] In patients with a predominantly CpcPH profile, sildenafil
improved haemodynamics, RV function, and quality of life at 6 and 12
months vs. placebo. [686] Furthermore, retrospective analyses and
registry data suggested improvements in exercise capacity with
PDE5i therapy in patients with HFpEF-associated CpcPH and with
a severe pre-capillary component (PVR mostly .5 WU). [450][,][687]

8.3.1.3. Interatrial shunt devices

Recent data suggest that specific interventions may be considered in selected cases of HFpEF, such as interatrial shunt devices to unload the
left heart. While this was associated with short-term improvements
in pulmonary vascular function, [688] the long-term effect on the pulmonary circulation remains unknown. The recent REDUCE LAP-HF II trial
failed to show a reduction in HF events after placement of an atrial
shunt device in a population of HF patients with LVEF ≥40%, [689] with
worse outcomes in the presence of PVD. [690] In addition, a sustained increase in PA blood flow may be a matter of concern, as this may trigger
vascular remodelling in patients with pre-existing PH.

8.3.1.4. Remote pulmonary arterial pressure monitoring in heart
failure
The importance of decongestion in patients with HF is underscored
by the use of implantable pressure sensors, remotely monitoring
PAP as a surrogate of left-sided filling pressure. Pulmonary arterial
pressure-based adjustment of HF therapy substantially reduced HF
hospitalizations and improved outcomes in both patients with
HFpEF and HFrEF, [691][–][694] with adjustment of diuretic therapy being
the most prominent therapeutic consequence. Further strategies
to optimize management depending on the haemodynamic phenotype in PH-LHD remain to be established. In HFrEF, novel medical
therapies such as ARNIs and SGLT-2is reduced remotely monitored
PAP and diuretic use, [695][–][698] potentially providing opportunities to
further optimize PAP-guided HF therapy.

8.3.2. Pulmonary hypertension associated with
valvular heart disease

Pulmonary hypertension frequently occurs as a consequence of
valvular heart disease. While surgical or interventional approaches
for valvular repair improve cardiopulmonary haemodynamics by reducing PAWP and PAP and improving forward SV, [699] persistent PH
after correcting valvular heart disease is frequent and associated with
adverse outcomes. [634][,][700]

8.3.2.1. Mitral valve disease

Both mitral stenosis and regurgitation regularly lead to post-capillary
PH. Functional (secondary) mitral regurgitation occurs in both HFrEF
and HFpEF, and is an important contributor to PH in LHD. Reducing


mitral regurgitation according to the recommendations of the 2021
ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [28] has a crucial role in improving haemodynamics in patients
with HFrEF, as this reduces mPAP and PAWP and improves the
CI. [699] Nevertheless, registry data have demonstrated that even moderately elevated sPAP negatively impacts post-procedural outcomes
after catheter-based therapy. [700]

8.3.2.2. Aortic stenosis

In patients with aortic stenosis undergoing surgical or catheter-based
aortic valve repair, pre-interventional PH is associated with a higher
risk of in-hospital adverse events and adverse long-term outcomes. [646][–][651] Although post-procedural improvement in PH correlates with symptom relief and favourable outcomes, persistence of
PH is common, and even moderate PH is associated with a higher
all-cause mortality. [646][–][651]

Of note, medical therapy of PH post-valvular repair may be harmful. A randomized study of 231 patients with surgically corrected
valvular heart disease and persistent PH showed that sildenafil therapy vs. placebo was associated with worse outcome when compared
with placebo; [701] however, this study did not distinguish between different types of PH (pre-capillary, IpcPH, and CpcPH).

8.3.2.3. Tricuspid regurgitation
Severe TR is associated with volume overload, increased RV work
load, and maladaptive remodelling, leading to symptomatic right HF
and impaired survival. [702][,][703] While primary TR is relatively rare, functional TR may arise from annular dilation in the presence of both PH
and LHD. Transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions have recently
emerged, aiming at reducing TR and RV volume overload. Of note,
correcting TR in patients with PAH or PH in (non-valvular) LHD
with significantly elevated PVR and/or RV dysfunction must be consid
–
ered with great caution, as this may be hazardous. [704] Right ventricle
PA coupling is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in such
patients. [705] Patient selection appears crucial, and a comprehensive
diagnostic approach integrating imaging modalities and invasive
haemodynamic assessment is necessary in the evaluation process
prior to tricuspid valve repair, particularly since echocardiography underestimates sPAP in the presence of severe TR.

8.3.3. Recommendations on the use of drugs
approved for PAH in PH-LHD
The recommendations on the use of drugs approved for PAH in patients with PH-LHD have been established based on key narrative
[question 5 (Supplementary Data, Section 8.3).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
The recommendations on the use of PDE5is in patients with
CpcPH associated with HFpEF are based on PICO question II
[(Supplementary Data, Section 8.4). Two RCTs that enrolled patients](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
with HFpEF and PH were identified, but no study that specifically enrolled patients with HFpEF and CpcPH. Harmful effects cannot be ex
cluded, even if the available data from clinical studies, case series, and

registries suggest that PDE5is may be safely administered to patients
with HFpEF-associated CpcPH. As a result, a general recommendation
for or against the use of PDE5is in patients with HFpEF and CpcPH cannot be made. However, it is clinically relevant to make a recommendation against their use for patients with HFpEF and IpcPH.

### 9. Pulmonary hypertension associated with lung diseases and/ or hypoxia (group 3)

Pulmonary hypertension is frequently observed in patients with
COPD and/or emphysema, ILD, combined pulmonary fibrosis and
emphysema (CPFE), and hypoventilation syndromes. [52][,][165][,][707][,][708]

Pulmonary hypertension is uncommon in obstructive sleep apnoea
unless other conditions coexist, such as COPD or daytime hypoventilation. [709] At high altitude (.2500 m) hypoxia-induced PH is
thought to affect .5% of the population, the development of PH
being related to geography and genetic factors. [710]

A PH screening study performed on a large cohort of .100
patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis confirmed that PH is


usually mild in that setting: from six patients (5.7%) presenting with pre-capillary PH, none had mPAP .30 mmHg and
PH was associated with PFT alteration, suggesting that the
rise in mPAP is associated with parenchymal involvement. [711]

Thus, PH in lymphangioleiomyomatosis is now classified in
group 3 PH. [1]

In patients with lung disease, PH is categorized as non-severe or
severe, depending on haemodynamic findings (Figure 12). In the
2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of
PH, severe PH was defined by mPAP .35 mmHg or mPAP
≥25 mmHg with CI,2.5 L/min/m [2] . [25][,][26] However, two recent

studies have demonstrated that a PVR .5 WU is a better thresh
old for predicting worse prognosis in patients with PH associated
with both COPD and ILD. [712][,][713] Based on these data, the current

guidelines used PVR to distinguish between non-severe PH (PVR

≤5 WU) and severe PH (PVR .5 WU). Whereas non-severe PH
is common in advanced COPD and ILD defined by spirometric criteria, severe PH is uncommon, occurring in 1–5% of cases of
COPD and,10% of patients with advanced ILD, with limited
data in obesity hypoventilation syndrome. [714][,][715] Even non-severe
PH in lung disease negatively impacts symptoms and survival, and
is associated with increased hospitalization. [715][–][717] Patients with
lung disease and severe PH have a worse outcome than those
with non-severe PH, providing evidence that this distinction has
clinical significance. [51][,][712][,][713][,][718][,][719] It is noteworthy that developing severe PH is largely independent of spirometry but usually accompanied by hypoxaemia, low PaCO 2, and a significant reduction
in DLCO. [51][,][714][,][718][,][719]


Pulmonary hypertension presenting in patients with lung disease
may be due to a number of causes, including undiagnosed CTEPH
or PAH. [714][,][720] Cardiac comorbidities are also common in patients
with lung disease and may contribute to PH. A number of distinct
phenotypes of PH in patients with lung disease, including a pulmonary vascular phenotype, have been proposed. [51][,][720] The pulmonary
vascular phenotype is characterized by better preserved spirometry,
low DLCO, hypoxaemia, a range of parenchymal involvement on
lung imaging, and a circulatory limitation to exercise. [51][,][714][,][718][–][722]

Recent studies have shown that the clinical characteristics, disease
trajectory, response to treatment, [451][,][718][,][719] and histological correlates [723][,][724] of patients with severe PH and minor lung disease are different to those in patients with IPAH, including a poorer prognosis.

3692 ESC/ERS Guidelines


9.1. Diagnosis
In patients with lung disease, symptoms of PH, especially exertional
dyspnoea, overlap with those of the underlying condition. Physical
findings may also be non-specific, for example: ankle swelling is common during episodes of ventilatory failure in COPD, where activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system may cause fluid
retention, usually in the setting of preserved RV function.
Non-invasive tests—such as ECG showing right axis deviation or
RV strain, elevated levels of BNP/NT-proBNP, CPET, or features on

—
cross-sectional imaging may suggest the diagnosis of PH in patients
with lung disease. [725][,][726] Echocardiography remains the most widely
used non-invasive diagnostic tool for assessing PH; however, the accuracy of echocardiography in patients with advanced respiratory
diseases is low, with a TRV unmeasurable in .50% of patients in
some studies, and there is a tendency to overestimate PAP and misclassify patients with PH. [86][,][87][,][727] More recent data suggest that a
stepwise, composite, echocardiographic score can identify patients
with severe PH, with and without an estimate of TRV, using other echocardiographic features including RA area, RV:LV ratio, and LV eccentricity index. [728] Where PH is suspected, combining echocardiography
with a contrast-enhanced CT may aid diagnostic assessment and disease
classification. [108][,][729][–][731] Pulmonary artery enlargement, RV outflow
hypertrophy, and increased RV:LV ratio may suggest a diagnosis of
PH. [108] Ideally, assessments should be made or repeated when the patient is clinically stable, as exacerbations can significantly raise PAP.
Key parts of evaluating suspected PH in lung disease include integrating: (1) the presence or absence of risk factors for PAH, CTEPH, or
LHD; (2) clinical features, including disease trajectory (e.g. rapid recent
deterioration vs. gradual change over years, and oxygen requirements);
(3) PFTs, including DLCO and blood gas analysis; (4) NT-proBNP measurements, ECG, and echocardiography; and (5) cross-sectional imaging
with contrast-enhanced CT, SPECT, or V/Q lung scan and, in selected
cases, cMRI [732] to assess the need for RHC. Cardiopulmonary exercise
testing may be helpful in assessing ventilatory or cardiac limitation in patients with lung disease, [121][,][733] although data are limited regarding its
clinical use in identifying patients with PH in lung disease.
Indications for RHC in lung disease include assessment for surgical
treatments (selected patients considered for LTx and lung volume reduction surgery), suspected PAH or CTEPH, and where further information will aid phenotyping of disease and consideration of therapeutic
[interventions (Figure S3).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data) [712][,][718][,][734] Such testing should ideally be conducted in PH centres when patients are clinically stable and treatment
of underlying lung disease has been optimized. Consideration should be
given to how pressure measurements are made, due to the impact of
changing intrathoracic pressures on pulmonary haemodynamics during
the respiratory cycle (see Section 5.1.12). [735]

9.2. Therapy
The therapeutic approach to group 3 PH starts with optimizing the
treatment of the underlying lung disease, including supplementary oxygen and non-invasive ventilation, where indicated, as well as enrolment
into pulmonary rehabilitation programmes. [736] There is limited and conflicting evidence for the use of medication approved for PAH in patients
with group 3 PH, and these drugs may have variable and sometimes
detrimental effects on haemodynamics, exercise capacity, gas exchange,
and outcomes in this patient population. [181][,][737][–][740]


9.2.1. Pulmonary hypertension associated with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or
emphysema
Studies using drugs approved for PAH in patients with PH associated
with COPD or emphysema have yielded conflicting results and are
mostly limited by small sample size, short duration, and insufficient
haemodynamic characterization of PH. [739][,][741][,][742] In a 16 week RCT
of 28 patients with COPD and severe PH confirmed by RHC, sildenafil therapy resulted in statistically significant improvements in PVR
and quality of life. [743] Registry data identified that ≏30% of patients
with COPD and severe PH, predominantly treated with PDE5is,
had improved WHO-FC, 6MWD, and PVR vs. baseline, and those
with a treatment response had improved transplant-free survival. [51][,][718] However, in the absence of large randomized trials, the
evidence is insufficient to support the general use of medication approved for PAH in patients with COPD and PH. Patients with COPD
and suspected or confirmed severe PH should be referred to PH
centres for individual decision-making.

9.2.2. Pulmonary hypertension associated with
interstitial lung disease
Numerous phase 2 and phase 3 studies have investigated the use of
ERAs to treat ILD, all with negative results. [740][,][744][,][745] In addition, the
PDE5i sildenafil has been investigated in phase 3 trials of patients with
ILD, also with negative results. [746][,][747] Few data from RCTs are available
for patients with PH associated with ILD, and many of the studies performed for this indication [748][,][749] suffered from the same limitations as

the aforementioned studies in PH associated with COPD. In addition,

there were several adverse safety signals: ambrisentan was associated
with an increased risk of clinical worsening in patients with ILD with
and without PH, [740][,][750] while riociguat was associated with an increased
risk of clinical worsening events, including potential excess mortality, in
patients with PH associated with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. [181]

In contrast, promising results have been obtained with the use of
inhaled treprostinil. A phase 3 RCT (INCREASE) examined inhaled
treprostinil at a target dose of 72 µg given four times daily in 326 patients with PH associated with ILD. [734][,][751] The PH diagnosis was confirmed by RHC within 1 year prior to enrolment. At week 16, the
placebo-corrected 6MWD improved by 31 m with inhaled treprostinil. There were also improvements in NT-proBNP and clinical worsening events, the latter driven by a lower proportion of patients
whose 6MWD declined by .15% from baseline.
Given the significant impact of even non-severe PH in patients
with lung disease, eligible patients should be referred for LTx evaluation. In patients with ILD and PH, inhaled treprostinil may be considered based on the findings from the INCREASE study, but
further data are needed, especially on long-term outcomes. The routine use of other medication approved for PAH is not recommended
in patients with ILD and non-severe PH. For patients with severe PH
and/or severe RV dysfunction, or where there is uncertainty regarding the treatment of PH, referral to a PH centre is recommended for
careful evaluation, to facilitate entry into RCTs, and consider PAH
[therapies on an individual basis (Figure S3). Registry data show that](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
some patients with group 3 PH are being treated with PAH medication, predominantly PDE5is, [718][,][752][,][753] but it is unclear if and to what
extent these patients benefit from this treatment.

9.2.3. Recommendations on the use of drugs

The recommendations on the use of drugs approved for PAH in pa
tients with PH associated with COPD and ILD have been established

[based on key narrative questions 6 and 7 (Supplementary Data,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)

[Sections 9.1 and 9.2, respectively).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
The recommendations on the use of PDE5is in patients with severe PH associated with ILD are based on PICO question III

[(Supplementary Data, Section 9.3). There are no direct data from](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
RCTs on the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of PDE5is in patients

with PH associated with ILD. The indirect data included in the


guidelines do not enable firm conclusions to be drawn. Given the
lack of robust evidence, the Task Force members felt unable to provide a recommendation for or against the use of PDE5is in patients
with ILD and severe PH, and recommend that these patients are referred to a PH centre for individualized decision-making.

considered to have CTEPD with or without PH; CTEPH remains the
preferred term for patients with PH, as defined in Section 3.1
(Table 5). [54] Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary disease describes
symptomatic patients with mismatched perfusion defects on V/Q
scan and with signs of chronic, organized, fibrotic clots on CTPA or
DSA, such as ring-like stenoses, webs/slits, and chronic total occlusions
(pouch lesions or tapered lesions), after at least 3 months of therapeutic anticoagulation. Pulmonary hypertension in this setting is not only a
consequence of PA obstruction by organized fibrotic clots but can also
be related to the associated microvasculopathy. In those patients without PH at rest, breathlessness could be due to exercise PH (see


definition in Section 3.1, Table 5) and/or increased dead space ventilation. [54] Excluding ventilatory limitation, deconditioning and psychogenic
hyperventilation syndrome by CPET and LV myocardial or valvular disease by echocardiography is of upmost importance when making
therapeutic decisions in patients with CTEPD without PH.

10.1. Diagnosis
Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension is a common
and important cause of PH, with a distinct management strategy.
Thus, the possibility of CTEPH should be carefully considered in all
patients with PH (Figure 13). In the context of acute PE, CTEPH

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3695


should be considered: (1) if radiological signs (detailed in Section
5.1.7) suggest CTEPH on the CTPA performed to diagnose PE, [112]

and/or if estimated sPAP is .60 mmHg [112] on echocardiogram; (2)
when dyspnoea or functional limitations persist in the clinical course
post-PE; [754] and (3) in asymptomatic patients with risk factors for
CTEPH or a high CTEPH prediction score. [755] Clinical conditions
such as permanent intravascular devices (pacemaker, long-term central lines, ventriculoatrial shunts), inflammatory bowel diseases, essential thrombocythaemia, polycythaemia vera, splenectomy,
antiphospholipid syndrome, high-dose thyroid hormone replacement, and malignancy are risk factors for CTEPH. [54][,][103][,][756]

Alternative causes of PA obstructions (also included in group 4 of the
PH classification)—including PA sarcomas, other malignant tumours
(e.g. renal carcinoma, uterine carcinoma, and germ-cell tumours of
the testis), non-malignant tumours (e.g. uterine leiomyoma), arteriitis
without CTD, congenital or acquired PA stenoses, parasites (hydatid
cyst), and foreign-body embolism—have to be considered in the differential diagnosis of CTEPD. [757] They can be explored by specific additional imaging such as [18] F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission
tomography (PET) scan, which can provide additional information
when PA sarcoma is suspected. [758]

Ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy [207] remains the most effective
tool in excluding CTEPD. Alternative perfusion imaging techniques

— —
such as iodine subtraction mapping, DECT, and MRI perfusion
have numerous theoretical advantages over V/Q but are more technically challenging and expensive, have limited availability, and currently lack multicentre validation.
Computed tomography pulmonary angiography with bi-planar reconstruction is broadly used for diagnosing CTEPD and assessing operability, but a negative CTPA, even if high quality, does not exclude
CTEPD, as distal disease can be missed. Digital subtraction angiography is still used to assess treatment options when CTPA is inconclusive. Selective segmental angiography, cone-beam CT, and area
detector CT allow for more accurate visualization of subsegmental
vasculature and are useful for procedural guidance for BPA. The benefits of the new technologies require validating in prospective trials
before being recommended for routine clinical use; a large,
European, multicentre study is currently ongoing. [759]

10.2. Therapy
The CTEPH treatment algorithm includes a multimodal approach of
combinations of pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), BPA, and medical therapies to target the mixed anatomical lesions: proximal, distal,
and microvasculopathy, respectively (Figures 14 and 15).
General measures recommended for PAH also apply to CTEPH,
including supervised exercise training, which is effective and safe in
inoperable CTEPH patients, [760] as well as early after PEA. [761]

Lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended for patients
with CTEPH, as recurrent pulmonary thrombo-embolism accompanied
by insufficient clot resolution are key pathophysiological features of this
disease. There are no RCTs in CTEPH with any of the approved anticoagulants; however, despite this lack of evidence, VKAs are recommended by experts, and are most widely used as background therapy
for patients with CTEPH. More recently, NOACs have more frequently
been used as alternatives to VKAs, again, lacking evidence from RCTs. A
retrospective case series from the UK and a multicentre prospective
registry (EXPERT) showed comparable bleeding rates for VKAs and


NOACs in CTEPH, but recurrent venous thrombo-embolism rates
were higher in those receiving NOACs. [762][,][763] In patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (10% of the CTEPH population), VKAs are recommended. [103][,][764][,][765] Screening for antiphospholipid syndrome should be
performed at CTEPH diagnosis. In the absence of any evidence in favour
or against prolonged anticoagulation in patients with CTEPD without
PH, long-term anticoagulant therapy is based on individual decisionmaking. It is recommended when the risk of PE recurrence is intermediate or high, thereby following the 2019 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism (Table 11). [103]

10.2.1. Surgical treatment
Surgical PEA is the treatment of choice for patients with accessible
PA lesions. [102] As surgery may normalize pulmonary haemodynamics
(65% decrease in PVR) [766] and functional capacity, an expert multidisciplinary team including an experienced PEA surgeon (on-site or
closely collaborating) is mandatory for evaluating operability and deciding final treatment. [102]

Operability is based on team experience, accessibility of PA lesions, correlation between severity of PH and degree of PA obstructions, and comorbidities. [767] The surgical technique is complex but
well standardized with .30 years of experience. It consists of a complete bilateral endarterectomy of the PAs down to segmental and
subsegmental levels in phases of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest
(Figure 15). [767][,][768] In CTEPH centres, surgical outcomes are favourable, with peri-operative mortality rates,2.5% due to improved
management of cardiac and pulmonary complications and wellestablished use of ECMO. [768] Post-operative PH is frequently observed (≏25%), [766] but long-term outcomes after PEA surgery are
excellent regarding survival (averaging 90% at 3 years) and quality
of life, [769][–][771] even in patients with distal PA obstructions. [772] On
the other hand, patients with proximal operable disease declining
surgery have a poor long-term outcome, with a 5 year survival of
53% compared with 83% in patients undergoing PEA. [773]

Therefore, PEA should be offered to all operable patients with a favourable risk:benefit ratio, ideally during a personal consultation between the patient and the PEA surgeon. [102]

Selected symptomatic patients with CTEPD without PH can be
successfully treated by PEA, with clinical and haemodynamic improvements at rest and exercise. [135][,][774] Those patients would require
careful discussion to balance risk and benefit.

10.2.2. Medical therapy
To manage the microvascular component of CTEPH (Figure 15),
medical therapies have been used off-label based on uncontrolled
studies and/or regional approvals. Meanwhile, three RCTs have successfully been conducted. The first phase 3 RCT investigated the efficacy of riociguat in patients with inoperable CTEPH or those with
persistent/recurrent PH after PEA. [775] Riociguat, after 16 weeks of
therapy, improved 6MWD and reduced PVR by 31% compared
with placebo, and is approved for this indication. Treprostinil s.c.
was investigated in a phase 3 RCT, which showed improved
6MWD at week 24 in patients with inoperable CTEPH or those
with persistent/recurrent PH after PEA receiving a high dose compared with a low dose; [776] s.c. treprostinil is approved for this indication. In a phase 2 study including only patients with inoperable
CTEPH, macitentan 10 mg improved PVR and 6MWD vs. placebo

evaluate the safety and efficacy of macitentan 75 mg in inoperable
or persistent/recurrent CTEPH (NCT04271475).

—
Other medical therapies PDE5is (e.g. sildenafil) and ERAs (e.g.

—
bosentan) have been used off-label, as their efficacy in inoperable
CTEPH has not been proven by RCTs or registry data. [769][,][778][,][779]

However, oral combination therapy, including PDE5is and ERAs, is
common practice in patients with CTEPH with severe haemodynamic compromise. [780]

10.2.3. Interventional treatment

Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (Figure 15) has become an established
treatment for selected patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent PH after PEA, improving haemodynamics (PVR decrease 49–66%), right heart function, and exercise capacity. [781][–][794]

Long-term outcomes are promising, but evidence is still scarce. [795]

A staged interventional procedure with a limited number of dilated PA segments per session is preferred. [102][,][788] The number of


sessions needed and haemodynamic results are dependent on experience. [781] While BPA is effective, it is associated with serious complications, which may be fatal. Procedural and post-interventional
complications include vascular injury due to wire perforation, and
lung injury with haemoptysis and/or hypoxia. [102][,][781][,][796][,][797] As with
all interventional procedures, a significant learning curve has been
shown, with reducing complication rates over time; [781] therefore,
this procedure should be performed in high-volume CTEPH centres.
As the rates of interventional complications can be reduced by medical pre-treatment, patients with a PVR .4 WU should be treated
before BPA (Figure 15). [798]

Selected symptomatic patients with CTEPD without PH and
segmental/subsegmental lesions can successfully be treated by BPA,
with clinical and haemodynamic improvements at rest and
exercise. [799]

Preliminary data on PADN point towards improved exercise capacity and pulmonary haemodynamics in patients with persistent PH
after PEA; [800] further confirmation is being awaited.

10.2.4. Multimodal treatment

Multimodal therapy including surgery, medication, and intervention is
offered to selected patients with CTEPH (Figure 15). [102]

Using medical therapy in patients with high pre-operative PVR to
improve pulmonary haemodynamics before PEA is common practice
but still controversial, as it is felt to delay timely surgical referral and
therefore definitive treatment. [801][–][803]

A significant proportion of symptomatic patients may have persistent or recurrent PH following PEA, which may also benefit
from medical and/or interventional therapies (Figure 15). [804][–][806] An
mPAP ≥30 mmHg has been associated with initiation of medical
therapies post-PEA, and an mPAP ≥38 mmHg and PVR ≥5 WU
with worse long-term survival. [806]


Some patients with CTEPH may have mixed anatomical lesions, with surgically accessible lesions in one lung and inoperable
lesions in the other lung. Such patients might benefit from a
combined approach with BPA (prior to or at the same time as
surgery) and PEA to decrease the surgical risk and improve
the final result. [807]

The recommendations on BPA and medical therapy in patients
with inoperable CTEPH have been established based on key narra[tive question 8 (Supplementary Data, Section 10.1).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)
The recommendation on the use of medical therapy before interventional therapy in patients with CTEPH who are considered inoperable but candidates for BPA is based on PICO question IV
[(Supplementary Data, Section 10.2). The included evidence suggests](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac237#supplementary-data)

3698 ESC/ERS Guidelines


that pre-treatment improves pulmonary haemodynamics and safety
of the procedure. This is confirmed by the clinical experience of Task
Force members. However, due to the low certainty of the evidence,

the recommendation is conditional.

10.2.5. Follow-up
Regardless of the result of PEA/BPA, patients should be regularly
followed-up, including invasive assessment with RHC 3–6 months
after intervention, allowing for consideration of a multimodal treatment approach. After successful treatment, yearly non-invasive followup, including echocardiography and an evaluation of exercise capacity,
is indicated because recurrent PH has been described (Figure 14). [806]

Risk assessment with either the ESC/ERS or REVEAL risk score

developed for PAH has been validated in medically treated patients
with CTEPH, [300][,][808][,][809] but it is unknown if its use has any therapeutic
implication or affects outcome.

good functional class (WHO-FC I II) and/or normalization or near


normalization of haemodynamics at rest, obtained at RHC 3–6 months
post-procedure (PEA or last BPA), and improvement in quality of life.

10.3. Chronic thrombo-embolic

pulmonary hypertension team and
experience criteria
To optimize patients’ outcomes, CTEPH centres should fulfil criteria
for a PH centre (Section 12) and have a CTEPH multidisciplinary team
consisting of a PEA surgeon, BPA interventionist, PH specialist, and
thoracic radiologist, trained in high-volume PEA and/or BPA centres.
The team should meet regularly to review new referrals and posttreatment follow-up cases. Ideally, CTEPH centres should have
PEA activities (.50/year) [810] and BPAs (.30 patients/year or
.100 procedures/year), [781] as these figures have been associated
with better outcome. The CTEPH centres should also manage medically treated patients. Based on regional requirements, these numbers may be adjusted for the country’s population, ideally
concentrating care and expertise in high-volume centres.

### 11. Pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (group 5)

Pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (Table 24) includes several conditions that may be complicated
by complex and sometimes overlapping pulmonary vascular

Table 24 Pulmonary hypertension with unclear and/
or multifactorial mechanisms


involvement. Although group 5 PH represents less-studied forms
of PH, it constitutes a significant part of the worldwide burden
of PH. [1] Group 5 PH includes: haematological disorders, such as
SCD and chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms; systemic disorders, such as sarcoidosis; metabolic diseases, such as glycogen storage disease; and others, such as chronic renal failure, pulmonary
tumour thrombotic microangiopathy, and fibrosing mediastinitis.

A common feature of these diseases is that the mechanisms of

PH are poorly understood and contributing factors may include,
alone or in combination: hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary vascular remodelling, thrombosis, fibrotic destruction and/
or extrinsic compression of pulmonary vasculature, pulmonary
vasculitis, high-output cardiac failure, and left HF. These patients

need careful assessment and treatment should be directed to the

underlying condition.

11.1. Haematological disorders
In haemoglobinopathies and chronic haemolytic anaemias, including
SCD, PH has emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
The prevalence of PH confirmed by RHC was 6–10% in studies of
adult patients with stable SCD. [93][,][94][,][813] Patients with SCD with precapillary PH are more commonly homozygous for haemoglobin S,
while some have S-β0 thalassaemia (S-β0 thal) or haemoglobin
SCD. [814] Thrombotic lesions are a major component of PH related
to SCD, more frequently in haemoglobin SCD. [814] Patients with
PH and SCD should be followed by multidisciplinary SCD and PH
teams, since treatment of the anaemia is a key part of management. [814] There is a lack of data to support the use of PAH drugs
in patients with SCD-associated PH. In a study in patients with
SCD with TRV ≥2.7 m/s and a 6MWD of 150–500 m, sildenafil
showed no treatment effect on 6MWD, TRV, or NT-proBNP, but
appeared to increase hospitalization rates for pain. [815] Preliminary
evidence supports the short- and long-term benefits of chronic
blood-exchange transfusions in patients with pre-capillary PH complicating SCD. [816] Pre-capillary PH complicating SCD has an important impact on survival, with an overall death rate of 2.0–5.3% in
different populations with similar follow-up (26 months and 18
months, respectively). [94][,][817] In β-thalassaemia, invasive haemodynamic evaluation confirmed pre-capillary PH in 2.1% of cases, while a
post-capillary profile was found in 0.3%. [818] Potential treatment strategies are awaiting an enhanced understanding of the

pathophysiological mechanisms. In spherocytosis, splenectomy is a
risk factor for CTEPH. [819]

Multiple causes of PH have been described in patients with chronic
myeloproliferative disorders. [820] In chronic myelogenous leukaemia,
spleen enlargement and anaemia can give rise to hyperkinetic syndrome. Hepatosplenic enlargement can also cause PoPH. Cases of
potentially reversible DPAH have been described with dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib. In polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia, there is an increased risk of venous thrombo-embolic
disease and CTEPH; moreover, a blood clot within the hepatic veins
can lead to Budd–Chiari syndrome and subsequent PoPH.
Pulmonary extramedullary haematopoiesis complicating idiopathic
or secondary myelofibrosis may also contribute to dyspnoea and PH.
Group 5 PH may be described in other haematological disorders,
such as common variable immunodeficiency; immunoglobulin G4
(IgG4)-related disease; Castleman disease; and polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal immunoglobulin, skin
changes (POEMS) syndrome. [821][–][823]

11.2. Systemic disorders

–
The reported prevalence of PH in patients with sarcoidosis is 6
20%. [824] The causes are multifactorial, including fibrosing lung disease,
granulomata in the PAs and/or pulmonary veins, fibrosing mediastinitis and/or extrinsic compression by lymph nodes, pulmonary vasculitis, CTEPH, and PoPH. [58][,][825] It is associated with significant
morbidity and increased mortality compared with sarcoidosis without PH. [58][,][825] In a registry, factors independently associated with outcomes included physiological (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/FVC
ratio and DLCO) and functional (6MWD) parameters. [58] In a large
study of severe, sarcoidosis-associated PH, PAH drugs improved
short-term pulmonary haemodynamics without improving
6MWD. [59] Small RCTs have suggested efficacy of PAH drugs in these
patients, which requires confirmation in larger studies. [826]

Corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy may improve
haemodynamics in selected patients with active granulomatous disease. Of note, when pulmonary vascular compression is suspected
(fibrosing mediastinitis and/or extrinsic compression by lymph
nodes), results from pulmonary angiography and PET scans provide
additional information justifying endovascular and/or antiinflammatory approaches. Long-term survival remains poor in
sarcoidosis-associated PH, which makes LTx a reasonable option

for selected severe cases.

In pulmonary Langerhans’s cell histiocytosis, diminished exercise
capacity does not appear to be due to ventilatory limitation but
may be related to pulmonary vascular dysfunction. In 29 patients
with PH associated with pulmonary Langerhans’s cell histiocytosis,
PAH drugs improved haemodynamics without worsening oxygen
levels. [827]

Pulmonary hypertension associated with neurofibromatosis type
1 is a rare but severe complication characterized by female predominance (female/male ratio 3.9:1). [828] Specific pulmonary vascular involvement exists in these patients, and despite a potential
short-term benefit of PAH drugs, prognosis remains poor, and
LTx should be considered in selected patients with severe disease.
In the presence of dyspnoea, screening for ILD by non-contrast
CT and for PH by echocardiography is required. [828]


11.3. Metabolic disorders

Glycogen storage diseases are caused by genetic alterations of glycogen metabolism, and PH case reports have been related to glycogen
storage disease type 1 and 2. [829] The occurrence of PH has predominantly been described in glycogen storage disease type 1, where it
may partly be due to vasoconstrictive amines such as serotonin.
Drugs for PAH have been used in some cases. [830]

Untreated patients with Gaucher disease may develop PH, which
is caused by a combination of factors, including asplenia, plugging of
the vasculature by abnormal macrophages, and pulmonary vascular
remodelling. Treatment with enzyme-replacement therapy may improve PH.

11.4. Chronic kidney failure
Although commonly recognized in chronic renal failure, the pathogenesis of PH remains poorly understood and PH is observed in patients prior to and while receiving different dialysis modalities. [831] A
recent RHC study of 3504 patients with chronic kidney disease
found that CpcPH was the most common phenotype, and the
phenotype with the highest mortality. [832] Post-capillary PH has
been described in 65% of patients receiving haemodialysis and 71%
of patients without kidney replacement. [833]

11.5. Pulmonary tumour thrombotic
microangiopathy
Pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy describes tumourcell microemboli with occlusive fibrointimal remodelling in small PAs,
pulmonary veins, and lymphatics. It is a rare cause of PH, which arises
due to multiple mechanisms, but probably remains under-diagnosed,
as evidenced by autopsy findings. [834] The disorder is associated with
carcinomas, notably gastric carcinoma. Progressive vessel occlusion
ultimately results in PH, which is often severe, of sudden onset, rapidly progressive, and accompanied by progressive hypoxaemia. Chest
CT may show patchy ground-glass and septal markings (masquerading as PVOD).

11.6. Fibrosing mediastinitis
Fibrosing mediastinitis is caused by fibrous tissue proliferating in the
mediastinum, encasing mediastinal viscera and compressing mediastinal
bronchovascular structures. [835] Pre- or post-capillary PH can complicate
the course of fibrosing mediastinitis due to extrinsic compression of the
PAs and/or pulmonary veins. Fibrosing mediastinitis can be idiopathic or
caused by irradiation, infection (tuberculosis, histoplasmosis), and systemic diseases, such as sarcoidosis and IgG4-related disease, a fibroinflammatory disease characterized by elevated serum IgG4 levels with
infiltration of IgG4+ plasma cells and severe fibrosis in affected tissues. [821] Treatment should be directed to the underlying condition.
No clear clinical improvement has been described with PAH drugs.
Surgical and endovascular procedures have been proposed to
de-obstruct or bypass the arterial and/or venous compressions.
In the absence of positive RCTs studying the use of PAH drugs for
treating group 5 PH, treating the underlying disorder remains the
standard of care. [836] Importantly, some of the diseases described in
Table 24 may have a pulmonary venous component that could be
made worse with PAH drugs, implying that off-label use of drugs approved for PAH should be considered with great caution, if at all.

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3701


Placebo-controlled, randomized trials are currently recruiting in
well-phenotyped subgroups of PH with unclear and/or multifactorial

mechanisms, such as sarcoidosis-associated PH.
### 12. Definition of a pulmonary hypertension centre


While PH is not an uncommon condition, severe forms of PH, es
pecially PAH and CTEPH, require highly specialized management.
Since medical centres with multidisciplinary teams and a high volume of patients generally offer best standard of care, which translates into better clinical outcomes, establishing PH centres is
clinically and economically highly desirable and is supported by


patient organizations and scientific societies. The purpose of a
PH centre is to: receive new referrals; assess and investigate the

cause of PH; carefully phenotype and routinely manage patients

with medical, interventional, and surgical approaches; work closely

with other health care providers to achieve the best outcomes for
patients; undertake audits (reporting patient case mix and quality

indicators); and be involved in clinical and translational research,

—
and education. The requirements comprising definition, multidisciplinary structure, number of cases, procedures, and staffing le
vels, as well as the skills and resources needed in a PH referral

centre—are described below and in Figure 16. Criteria for paediatric

and CTEPH centres are described elsewhere (Sections 7.8.3 and 10.3,
respectively).

3702 ESC/ERS Guidelines


12.1. Facilities and skills required for a
pulmonary hypertension centre
Pulmonary hypertension centres care for a sufficient number of patients on PH therapy, as well as new referrals, to warrant this status.
According to the 2015 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and
treatment of PH and the European Reference Network on rare respiratory diseases (ERN-LUNG) competency requirements, the
ideal number of patients seen by an adult centre each year is no fewer than 200, of which at least half have a final diagnosis of PAH; a PH
centre follows at least 50 patients with PAH or CTEPH and receives
at least two new referrals per month with documented PAH or
CTEPH. [25][,][26][,][837][–][839] These numbers can be adapted according to
specific country characteristics (small population, large geographical
area) provided that strong working collaborations are established
with high-volume centres. This is currently facilitated by the availability of secure virtual platforms (e.g. ERN clinical patient management
system). [840]

Proper training of staff members includes core competencies, such
as those outlined in the ERS Pulmonary Vascular Diseases Continuing
Professional Development framework, [841] and builds on entrustable
professional activities, described in the ESC Core Curriculum. [842]

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging facilities include: a ward where
health care providers have expertise in PH; a specialist outpatient
service; an intermediate/ICU; 24/7 emergency care; an interventional
radiology unit; diagnostic investigations, including echocardiography,
CT scanning, nuclear medicine, MRI, exercise tests, and PFTs; a cardiac catheterization laboratory; access to genetic counselling and
testing; and fast and easy access to cardiothoracic and vascular surgery. Key diagnostic procedures are performed in sufficient numbers
to guarantee expertise (e.g. ERN-LUNG requirements). [837] In analogy with the ‘advanced heart failure units’, [843] PH centres offer the
full range of PAH therapies available in their country (including i.v./
s.c. prostacyclin derivatives) and have early referral protocols to
CTEPH, LTx, and rehabilitation centres. Since evaluation and early
availability of new drugs and techniques are critical, PH centres participate in collaborative clinical research.
Regular multidisciplinary team meetings, including core members
and on-demand invited members (extended multidisciplinary team)
as needed (Figure 16), are required to establish and adapt individual
patient care pathways. Case management (co-ordination of individual patient pathways) should include administrative, social, and care
support. Remote accessibility of the PH centre by phone, mail, or
other is a vital part of the care. Strategies have to be implemented
in order to improve health literacy and shared decision-making,
with the support of dedicated patient decision tools. Transitioning
from a paediatric PH centre to an adult PH centre requires adequate
planning to prevent gaps in care. Involving national and/or international patient associations helps to design patient-centric care
and to spread medical knowledge among patients and their carers.
Pulmonary hypertension centres should record patients’ data
using local, national, or international patient registries, and be able
to report process indicators (compliance with diagnostic and treatment guidelines, including LTx) and outcome indicators, such as
WHO-FC, exercise capacity, haemodynamics, quality of life, complications, and survival. They should undergo regular audits to assess
the quality of delivered care.

b Level of evidence.

12.2. European Reference Network
In 2017, the European Commission launched European Reference
Networks (ERNs) for rare diseases that included the ERN-LUNG
with a PH core network. European Reference Networks are patientcentred networks of commissioned centres offering guidance and
cross-border best standard of care in the European Union. The
PH network includes over 20 full members, contributing each year
≏1500 new patients with PAH or CTEPH. [844] It also includes UK
supporting centres, and affiliated partners (who do not necessarily
have to fulfil the minimum competency criteria of the ERN-LUNG
PH network). The ERN-LUNG requires and monitors standards

for these centres.

12.3. Patient associations and patient
empowerment
Pulmonary hypertension centres should inform patients about patient associations and encourage them to join such groups. Patient
associations are a valuable resource for managing patients, as they
provide educational and emotional support, and can have positive effects on coping, confidence, and outlook. [845] It is recommended that
PH centres collaborate with patient associations on initiatives to


Recommendation Table 25 — Recommendations for
pulmonary hypertension centres










ESC/ERS Guidelines 3703


empower patients and improve the patient experience, addressing
issues such as health literacy, digital skills, healthy lifestyles, mental
health, and self-management. Health care can be delivered more effectively and efficiently if patients are full partners in the process.
### 13. Key messages

(1) The haemodynamic definition of PH has been updated as
mPAP .20 mmHg. The definition of PAH also implies a PVR
.2 WU and PAWP ≤15 mmHg. These cut-off values better
reflect the limits of normal ranges, but do not yet translate
into new therapeutic recommendations, since the efficacy of

–
PAH therapy in patients with PVD and an mPAP 21
24 mmHg and/or PVR 2–3 WU is still unknown.
(2) The main diagnostic algorithm for PH has been simplified following a three-step approach, from suspicion by first-line physicians, detection by echocardiography, and confirmation with
RHC in PH centres. Warning signs associated with worse outcomes have been identified, which justify immediate referral
and management in PH centres.
(3) Screening strategies for PAH in patients with SSc and in those at
risk of HPAH are proposed based on the results of published
cohort studies. Their implementation may shorten the time
from symptom onset to diagnosis of PAH.
(4) An improved recognition of CT and echocardiographic signs of
CTEPH at the time of an acute PE event, together with a systematic follow-up of patients with acute PE, as indicated in
the 2019 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism, should help to remediate
the underdiagnosis of CTEPH.
(5) The three-strata risk-stratification assessment in PAH has been
refined after being validated in multiple registries. The MRI and
echocardiographic criteria have been added to the ESC/ERS table, refining non-invasive evaluation at diagnosis.
(6) A four-strata risk stratification, dividing the large, intermediate-risk
group into intermediate–low and intermediate–high risk, is proposed at follow-up.
(7) The treatment algorithm for PAH has been simplified, with a
clear focus on risk assessment, cardiopulmonary comorbidities,
and treatment goals. Initial combination therapy and treatment
escalation at follow-up when appropriate are current standards.
(8) The Task Force has attempted to close the gap between paediatric and adult PAH care, with therapeutic and follow-up strategies based on risk stratification and treatment response,
extrapolated from that in adults but adapted for age.
(9) The recommendations on sex-related issues in patients with
PAH, including pregnancy, have been updated, with information
and shared decision-making as key points.
(10) The recommendations for rehabilitation and exercise programmes in PH have been updated following the release of additional supportive evidence.
(11) For the first time, there is a recommendation for PH medical
therapy in group 3 PH, based on a single positive RCT in pa
tients with ILD.

(12) The concept of CTEPD with or without PH has been introduced, enabling further research on the natural history and
management in the absence of PH.


(13) The treatment algorithm for CTEPH has been modified, including multimodal therapy with surgery, PH drugs, and BPA.
### 14. Gaps in evidence

14.1. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
(group 1)

- The efficacy and safety of PAH drugs in group 1 patients with an
mPAP 21–24 mmHg, PVR 2–3 WU, and exercise PH has to be

established.

- The role of PAH drugs in different PAH subgroups, including
schistosomiasis-associated PAH, needs to be explored.

- Risk-stratification assessment in PAH needs to be further prospectively validated through goal-orientated outcome studies,
and optimized for patients with PAH and comorbidities.

- New PAH phenotypes observed in patients with significant cardiopulmonary comorbidities are common and should be the focus of

more research.

- The importance of PAH patient phenotypes and the relevance of
comorbidities on treatment goals and outcomes must be further

evaluated.

- The impact of PAH therapies and treatment strategies on survival

needs to be further assessed.

- Pulmonary arterial hypertension drugs targeting novel pathways
are emerging and the impact of add-on use of this medication

on outcomes has to be evaluated in RCTs.

- The role of RV imaging techniques (echocardiography, cMRI) in
diagnosing and stratifying risk in PAH needs to be further studied.
The proposed cut-off values for risk stratification need to be properly validated in multicentre studies.

- The role of CPET in the early diagnosis of PAH in populations at
risk of developing PAH, and in assessing prognosis in PAH on
top of clinical and haemodynamic data, needs further investigation.

- The role of exercise echocardiography and exercise RHC in patients at risk of developing PAH, with abnormal CPET but normal
rest echocardiogram, also needs further evaluation.

- The use of mechanical circulatory support, particularly in reversible PH or in patients with advanced right HF with an exit strategy
(such as LTx), has to be further studied.

- Differences in natural history and treatment response between
adults and children should be further investigated.

- Further studies are needed on the effects of PADN in PAH and in

other PH groups.

- The impact of centre volume, organization, and expertise on treatment outcome needs further investigation.

14.2. Pulmonary hypertension associated
with left heart disease (group 2)

- The management of patients with group 2 PH needs further study

with RCTs.

- Additional research is needed to facilitate non-invasive diagnosis of
HFpEF-associated PH and distinguishing it from PAH.

- The role of fluid challenge and exercise testing to reveal left HF

needs further validation.

3704 ESC/ERS Guidelines



- Further studies focusing on PDE5is in patients with HFpEF and a
CpcPH phenotype are needed and currently underway.

- The effects that new HF medication (ARNIs, SGLT-2is) has on PH,
through reverse remodelling of the LV, need further investigation.

14.3. Pulmonary hypertension associated
with lung diseases and/or hypoxia
(group 3)

- The management of patients with group 3 PH has to be further

studied in RCTs.

- Refining phenotypes will be crucial, as this will inform development

of trials.

- Clinical relevance and therapeutic implications of severe PH in lung
disease need to be investigated.

- Long-term data on the effects of inhaled treprostinil (and other
PAH drugs) in patients with PH associated with lung disease are

needed.

- The impact of the hypobaric and hypoxic environment of the .150
million people living at .2500 m altitude has tobe clarified, and studies
need to be performed to assess potential treatment strategies for PH.

14.4. Chronic thrombo-embolic
pulmonary hypertension (group 4)

- The differentiation between acute and chronic PE in imaging
(CTPA) has to be improved.



- In patients with suspected CTEPH, the diagnostic role of DECT or
iodine subtraction mapping vs. V/Q lung scintigraphy has to be

validated.

- The effect of drug therapy on the outcome of patients with

CTEPH needs to be established.

- The treatment goals in patients with CTEPH have to be clarified, as
it is still unclear if normalizing mPAP and PVR translates into improved outcomes.

- The role of BPA vs. PEA should be further clarified: which treatment in which patient? Are they equivalent for the treatment of
segmental/subsegmental disease?

- In inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent PH after PEA, the
potential role of combination therapy of PH drugs must be

assessed.

- The role of medical treatments as bridges to interventional and operative treatments needs to be formally tested.

- Randomized controlled trials are needed to discriminate the ef
fects of PEA and early follow-up rehabilitation.

- The effect of PEA, BPA, and medical therapy on patients with

CTEPD without PH is not established.

14.5. Pulmonary hypertension with
unclear and/or multifactorial
mechanisms (group 5)

- Further research needs to inform management of group 5 PH,

such as SCD-associated PH and sarcoidosis-associated PH.

e Cardiopulmonary comorbidities are predominantly encountered in elderly patients and include risk factors for HFpEF such as obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease, a history of
hypertension, and/or a low DLCO.
f ERA used in the GRIPHON study were bosentan and ambrisentan.
g The PATENT plus study investigated the combination of sildenafil and riociguat; however, combining riociguat with any PDE5i is contraindicated.
h Safety concerns have been identified when ERAs are used in patients with HF (HFpEF and HFrEF, with or without PH) and when sildenafil is used in patients with persistent PH after

correction of valvular heart disease.
i Assessments should ideally be made when the patient is clinically stable, as exacerbations can significantly raise pulmonary artery pressure.
j This recommendation does not apply to patients with end-stage lung disease who are not considered candidates for LTx.
k This does not include inhaled treprostinil, which may be considered in patients with PH associated with ILD irrespective of PH severity.

### 16. Quality indicators

Quality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care
quality, including structural, process, and outcomes of care. [847] They
may also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to guideline
recommendations through associated quality-improvement initiatives and benchmarking of care providers. [848][,][849] As such, the role
of QIs in improving care and outcomes for cardiovascular disease
is increasingly being recognized by health care authorities, professional organizations, payers, and the public. [847]

The ESC understands the need for measuring and reporting quality and outcomes of cardiovascular care, and has established


methods for developing the ESC QIs for the quantification of care
and outcomes for cardiovascular diseases. [847] To date, the ESC has
developed QI suites for a number of cardiovascular diseases [850][–][852]

and embedded these in respective ESC Clinical Practice guidelines. [27][,][477][,][853][,][854] Furthermore, the ESC aims to integrate its QIs
with clinical registries such as the EurObservational Research
Programme and the European Unified Registries On Heart Care
Evaluation and Randomized Trials (EuroHeart) project [855] to provide
real-world data about the patterns and outcomes of care for cardiovascular disease across Europe.
In parallel with the writing of this Clinical Practice Guideline, a process has been initiated to develop QIs for patients with PH using the

ESC/ERS Guidelines 3711


ESC methodology and through collaboration with domain experts
and the Heart Failure Association of the ESC. Such QIs may be
used for evaluating the quality of care for patients with PH, and enable important aspects of care delivery to be captured. These QIs,
alongside their specifications and development process, will be published separately.
