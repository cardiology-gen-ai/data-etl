### 1. Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence, with the aim

of assisting health professionals in proposing the best management
strategies for an individual patient with a given condition.

Guidelines and their recommendations should facilitate decision
making of health professionals in their daily practice. Guidelines,
however, are not a substitute for the patient’s relationship with their
practitioner. The final decisions concerning an individual patient must
be made by the responsible health professional(s), based on what
they consider to be the most appropriate in the circumstances.
These decisions are made in consultation with the patient and care
giver as appropriate.
Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals. To en
sure that all users have access to the most recent recommenda
tions, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) makes its
guidelines freely available. The ESC warns readers that the technical
language may be misinterpreted and declines any responsibility in
this respect.
Many guidelines have been issued in recent years by the ESC.
Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all
decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website
[(https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines re-](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
present the official position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.
In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the
ESC carries out the EURObservational Research Programme of
international registries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions, which are essential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources, and adherence to guidelines. These
registries aim to provide a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world, and are based on high-quality
data collected during routine clinical practice. Furthermore, the
ESC develops sets of quality indicators (QIs)—which are tools
to evaluate the level of implementation of the guidelines and
may be used by the ESC, hospitals, healthcare providers, and

ESC Guidelines 3833


professionals to measure clinical practice, and in educational programmes—alongside the key messages from the guidelines, to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes.
The members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with
this pathology. The selection procedure aimed to ensure that there is
a representative mix of members, predominantly from across the
whole of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty
Communities. Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion,
notably with respect to gender and country of origin. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the risk–benefit ratio. The level of evidence
and the strength of the recommendation of particular management

Table 1 Classes of recommendations


options were weighed and scored according to pre-defined scales, as
outlined below. The Task Force followed the ESC voting procedures.
All recommendations subject to a vote achieved at least 75% among
voting members.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of
interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest
[rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[Guidelines) and have been compiled in a report and simultaneously](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
published in a supplementary document to the guidelines. This process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of

Table 2 Levels of evidence



3834 ESC Guidelines


interest that arose during the writing period were notified to the
ESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare
industry.
The ESC CPG Committee supervises and coordinates the preparation of new guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the
approval process of these guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo
extensive review by the CPG Committee and external experts, including a mix of members from across the whole of the ESC region
and from relevant ESC Subspecialty Communities and National
Cardiac Societies. After appropriate revisions, the guidelines are
signed-off by all the experts involved in the Task Force. The finalized
document is signed-off by the CPG Committee for publication in the
European Heart Journal. The guidelines are developed after careful
consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their writing.
The task of developing the ESC Guidelines also includes creating
educational tools and implementating programmes for the recommendations, including condensed pocket guidelines versions, summary slides, summary cards for non-specialists, and an electronic
version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions
are abridged and thus, for more detailed information, the user should
always access the full text version of the guidelines, which is
freely available via the ESC website and the European Heart Journal.
The National Cardiac Societies of the ESC are encouraged to
endorse, adopt, translate, and implement all ESC Guidelines.
Implementation programmes are needed because it has been shown
that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the
thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, and in determining and implementing preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic
medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines do not override,
in any way whatsoever, the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in considering
each patient’s health condition and in consulting with that patient
or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is
also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and
regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the
time of prescription and, where appropriate, to respect the ethical
rules of their profession.
Off-label use of medication may be presented in these guidelines
if a sufficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically appropriate to a given condition and if patients could benefit
from the recommended therapy. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health
professional, giving special consideration to:

(a) the specific situation of the patient. In this respect, it is specified
that, unless otherwise provided for by national regulations, off
label use of medication should be limited to situations where it

is in the patient’s interest to do so, with regard to the quality,
safety, and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has been
informed and provided consent;
(b) and country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental drug regulatory agencies, and the ethical rules to which
health professionals are subject, where applicable.

Arrhythmias


Patients with ICDs, whose devices have been pre-operatively

deactivated, should be on continuous cardiac monitor throughout

the period of deactivation. External defibrillation equipment
should be readily available. I


It is recommended that patients with temporarily deactivated ICDs

have continuous ECG monitoring, and during the peri-operative

period are accompanied by personnel skilled in early detection and

treatment of arrhythmias. In high-risk patients (e.g.

pacemaker-dependant or ICD patients), or if access to the torso

will be difficult during the procedure, it is recommended to place
transcutaneous pacing/defibrillation pads prior to NCS.

2.2. The magnitude of the problem
The annual volume of major surgery worldwide is estimated to be
more than 300 million patients (about 5% of the world population),
which is a 34% increase from 2004 to 2012. [1][,][2] Nearly 74% of these
operations are performed in countries spending substantial amounts
on health care. When applied to European Union countries, which


had an overall population of 448 million in 2020 (27 countries),
this figure translates into a crude estimate of nearly 22 million major
procedures annually. [2]

Nearly 85% of major operations are non-cardiac surgical procedures. [3] In a recent report from the USA National Inpatient Sample
database, nearly half of adults aged ≥45 years undergoing major non
3840 ESC Guidelines


cardiac surgery (NCS) presented with at least two cardiovascular
(CV) risk factors, 18% had coronary artery disease (CAD), 4.7%
had a history of stroke, and 7.7% had a modified Revised Cardiac
Risk Index (RCRI) score ≥3 (range 0–6) in 2012–13. These prevalence rates show a substantial increase compared with the equivalent
rates in 2008–09. [4] In a large registry including 37 915 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) with
drug-eluting stent (DES), the rates of NCS after PCI were 11%
and 24%, 1 and 3 years after PCI respectively. The cut-off ages at
which NCS was more likely to occur within 1 and 3 years of PCI
were 62 and 73 years respectively. [5]

The prevalence of comorbidities, the clinical condition of patients
before surgery, and the urgency, magnitude, type, and duration of the
surgical procedure determine the risk of peri-operative complications. In a recent cohort study of 40 000 patients aged ≥45 years
undergoing inpatient NCS, one of seven experienced a major cardiac
or cerebrovascular complication at 30 days. [6] Cardiovascular complications can particularly occur in patients with documented or asymptomatic coronary heart disease, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction,
valvular heart disease (VHD), and arrhythmias, who undergo surgical
procedures that are associated with prolonged haemodynamic and
cardiac stress. In the case of peri-operative myocardial ischaemia,
three mechanisms are important: (i) oxygen supply–demand mismatch on the background of coronary artery stenosis that may become flow-limiting by peri-operative haemodynamic fluctuations;
(ii) acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to stress-induced erosion
or rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque in combination
with pro-inflammatory and hypercoagulable states induced by surgery, and the haemodynamic distress resulting from fluid shifts and
anaesthesia; and (iii) surgery-associated bleeding risk requiring interruption of antiplatelet therapies, which might lead to stent thrombosis among patients undergoing NCS after recent coronary stent
placement. Left ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias may occur
for various reasons at all ages. Because the prevalence of CAD,
VHD, heart failure, and arrhythmias increases with age, perioperative CV mortality and morbidity are predominantly an issue
in the adult population undergoing major NCS.
In Europe, recent systematic data on the annual number and type
of operations, and on patient outcomes are unfortunately lacking.
Additionally, data definitions vary, as do data quantity and quality.
Based on the estimates outlined above, nearly 6.6 million procedures
are performed annually in European patients with CAD, peripheral
artery disease (PAD), and cerebrovascular disease who are at high
risk of CV complications. In a 7 day cohort study, the European
Surgical Outcomes Study (EuSOS) group investigated the outcomes
of NCS in 498 hospitals across 27 European nations and the UK; up
to 8% of patients undergoing NCS required critical care admission,

–
while in-hospital mortality ranged 1.4 21.5% (mean 4.0%), depending on safety precautions. [7] In a recent prospective study of 2265
high-risk patients undergoing NCS in Switzerland, one out of five developed major adverse events within 365 days. [8] When applied to the
population in European Union countries, these figures translate into
at least 660 000 major cardiac or cerebrovascular complications occurring annually due to NCS procedures.

The 2022 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular assessment and man
agement of patients undergoing NCS focus on the pre-operative CV
risk assessment and peri-operative management of patients in whom


cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a potential source of complications
during NCS.

2.3. Change in demographics
Within the next 30 years, the ageing of the population will have a major impact on peri-operative patient management. Patients undergoing
NCS are older than the rest of the population. Furthermore, it is estimated that by 2030, one-fifth of individuals aged .75 years will
undergo surgery each year. In addition, between 2018 and 2050, the

–
number of people in Europe aged 75 84 years is projected to increase
by ≏60%. The total number of surgical procedures may increase even
faster because of the greater need for interventions with increasing
age. Demographics of patients undergoing surgery show trends towards increasing numbers of elderly patients and increasing numbers
of patients with comorbidities, particularly CVDs. Thus, adults aged
≥75 years have a greater risk of peri-operative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) (9.5% vs. 4.8% for younger adults [P,
0.001]). [9] However, age per se seems to be responsible for a small increase in the risk of complications; greater risks are associated with urgency and significant CV, pulmonary, and renal disease.

2.4. Purpose
As many years have passed and new evidence has become available since
the publication of the 2014 ESC/European Society of Anaethesiology
(ESA) Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery: cardiovascular assessment
and management, [10] the ESC has decided to revise the guidelines on
NCS. These new guidelines are based on the 2014 edition, but all sec
tions have been revised or rewritten, and several new sections have

been added. Some of the old recommendations are unchanged or

have been revised, and new recommendations have been added.

These guidelines are intended for physicians, healthcare workers,
and collaborators involved in the pre-operative, operative, and postoperative care of patients undergoing NCS. The objective is to endorse a standardized and evidence-based approach to peri-operative
CV management. The guidelines recommend a stepwise evaluation
of the patient that integrates clinical risk factors and test results
with the estimated stress of the planned surgical procedure and
the risks involved with the discontinuation of drugs. This results in
an individualized risk assessment, with the opportunity of initiating
medical therapy, coronary interventions, and specific surgical and anaesthetic techniques, or withholding medical therapy, in order to optimize the patient’s peri-operative condition. Further, it should be
discussed in which institutions (specialized small hospital vs. tertiary
care) the NCS will be performed. It is important that patients’ values
and preferences with respect to the benefits and risks of surgery are
taken into consideration, and that patients are involved in the decisions. This is particularly important when it comes to decisions about
undergoing elective surgery or not, the timing of surgery, and choice
of surgical and anaesthetic techniques.
Compared with non-surgical settings, randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) are scarce in this field. However, since the publication of the
2014 ESC/ESA Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery: cardiovascular assessment and management there has been a significant increase in
RCTs that are relevant in this setting. When no trials are available
on a specific CV management regimen in the surgical setting, data
from the non-surgical setting may be extrapolated and similar re
commendations made, but with different levels of evidence.

ESC Guidelines 3841


These guidelines have the potential to improve peri- and postoperative outcomes and highlight the existence of a clear opportunity
for improving the quality of care. Following the publication of these
updated guidelines on NCS, their effects on outcomes should be monitored. The objective evaluations of the quality of the assessments and
the outcomes are described in quality indicators (Section 13).

2.5. The outcomes we want to prevent
The recommendations in these guidelines are intended to prevent
peri-operative CV morbidity and mortality, for example: perioperative myocardial infarction/injury (PMI), stent thrombosis, acute
heart failure (HF), haemodynamically relevant arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism (PE), ischaemic stroke, and death. It is also important
to prevent bleeding complications, especially associated with antithrombotic treatment, since bleeding is associated with an increased
risk of MI and death. [6][,][11][–][13]
### 3. Clinical risk evaluation

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing NCS
are determined by two main factors: patient-related risk and type of
surgery or procedure, including the circumstances under which it


takes place (experience of institution, elective vs. emergency procedure). [14] The risk may be reduced by an adequate pre-operative evaluation and proper selection of type and timing of the surgical
procedure (Figure 1).

3.1. Surgery-related risk
The surgery-related risk is determined by the type and duration
of the surgery, and the urgency of the procedure or intervention.
The type of anaesthesia and anaesthetic drugs may also influence
the risk of complications in patients at intermediate to high cardiac
risk undergoing NCS (see Section 7). [15] The surgical risk estimate is
a broad approximation of 30 day risk of CV death, MI, and stroke,
which only takes into account the specific surgical intervention without considering the patient’s comorbidities (Table 5). [10][,][16]

Any surgical procedure may increase the level of cortisol and catecholamines as stress responses due to tissue injury and inflamma
–
tion, and neuro endocrine and sympathovagal imbalance. Changes in
body core temperature, blood loss, and fluid shifts may cause a rise in
vascular resistance as well as hypotension, [17] leading to imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and delivery. Bleeding, transfusion
of blood products, tissue injury, and inflammatory response may affect the coagulation system, inducing a prothrombotic state.












Figure 1 Total risk is an interaction of patient-related and surgery-related risk. Ideally, the total risk should be as close as possible to the lower left
corner, by choosing surgery/procedure/anaesthesia/institution with the lowest possible risk along with efforts to mitigate the patient’s CV risk.

3.1.1. Timing of surgery
In general, acute procedures carry a higher risk of complications than
elective procedures. Uniform timing definitions are unfeasible, as the
time spans may vary between diseases. These guidelines use the timing definitions below.
Immediate: surgery/intervention should be performed without
any delay to save life or organ function.
Urgent: surgery/intervention should be performed without unnecessary delay to save life, limb, or organ function.
Time-sensitive: surgery/intervention should be performed as
soon as possible as there is a time-dependent risk of losing limb or
organ function, or increased risk of complications. Cancer surgery
is typically time-sensitive, as is carotid surgery to prevent stroke in
a symptomatic case. The time window for time-sensitive surgery
will vary depending on the underlying disease.
Elective: surgery/intervention can be performed electively (not
further defined) without significant risk of losing limb, or organ function, or increased risks of complications.
Many factors affect outcomes when comparing acute or timesensitive vs. elective surgery: the general condition of the patient
vs. the stage of the acute illness, and how far it has progressed.
The best interests of the patient should be considered before
deciding on treatment, informed consent to management should
be obtained, if at all possible, and decisions should be clearly
recorded. [24]

The degree of urgency should also be considered (i.e. does
the procedure need to be performed outside working hours
or can it wait until the next day?). In general, competences
and supportive functions are not always present in the evenings
or during the night; thus, an overall evaluation of what best
serves the patient is necessary. The optimal timing of NCS
should be discussed within the multidisciplinary team, including


an anaesthesiologist, in order to achieve optimized anaesthesia
for each patient (see Section 7).

3.2. Type of surgical approach
New surgical techniques have been introduced to replace open surgery and to reduce the overall risk for the patient.

3.2.1. Laparoscopy
Laparoscopic procedures, compared with open surgical procedures,
have the advantage of causing less tissue trauma and intestinal paralysis,
resulting in less incisional pain, better post-operative pulmonary function, significantly fewer wall complications, and diminished postoperative fluid shifts related to bowel paralysis. [25] However, the pneumoperitoneum required for these procedures results in elevated
intra-abdominal pressure and a reduction in venous return. Typical
physiological sequelae are secondary to increased intra-abdominal
pressure and absorption of the gaseous medium used for insufflation.
While healthy individuals on controlled ventilation typically tolerate pneumoperitoneum, patients with CVD, some types of adults
with congenital heart disease (ACHD), and obese patients may experience adverse consequences. [26] Pneumoperitoneum and
Trendelenburg position result in increased mean arterial pressure,
central venous pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance impairing cardiac function. [27][,][28] Therefore, compared with open
surgery, the CV risk in patients with CVD is not necessarily reduced
in patients undergoing laparoscopy, and both should be evaluated in
the same way. This is especially true in patients undergoing interventions for morbid obesity, but also in other types of surgery, considering the risk of conversion to an open procedure. [29][,][30] Superior
short-term outcomes of laparoscopic vs. open procedures have
been reported, depending on type of surgery, operator experience,

ESC Guidelines 3843


and hospital volume; however, few studies provide direct measures
of cardiac complications. [31][–][33] The benefit of laparoscopic procedures is probably greater in elderly patients, with reduced length
of hospital stay, intra-operative blood loss, incidence of postoperative pneumonia, time to return of normal bowel function, incidence of post-operative cardiac complications, and wound
infections. [34]

3.2.1.1. Vascular and endovascular procedures
Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a procedure using femoral artery access only, and is therefore associated with lower operative mortality and morbidity than open
repair. It minimizes the surgical risk in simultaneous surgery for
the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and a noncardiac disorder, and shortens the time delay from the treatment
of AAA and the non-cardiac disorder in patients undergoing twophase surgery. [35][–][37] The early gain in mortality from EVAR procedures is lost after 3–4 years, compared with open surgical treatment, due to general morbidity (especially CV mortality) of
AAA patients.
Various vascular and non-vascular NCS procedures bear different
operative risks. While aortic and infra-inguinal vascular surgical
procedures are both regarded as high-risk procedures, their risk
can be modified by adequate peri-operative measures. [38] For
patients undergoing treatment of femoropopliteal artery disease,
an endovascular-first approach may be advisable in case of additional
significant comorbidity. A meta-analysis of studies comparing open
surgery with PCI for the treatment of femoropopliteal arterial disease showed that femoral bypass surgery was associated with higher

–
morbidity (odds ratio [OR] 2.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34
6.41) but similar mortality at 30 days compared with endovascular
treatment. [39]

3.2.1.2. Video-assisted non-cardiac surgery
Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is supported by a trial
showing fewer peri-operative complications and a better quality
of life in the first year following surgery for stage 1 lung cancer compared with anterolateral thoracotomy. [20] Also, a large propensity
matched study conducted by the European Society of Thoracic
Surgeons (ESTS) showed fewer post-operative complications following VATS compared with open thoracotomy. [21] Overall, the
benefits seem greatest in patients with reduced functional lung

capacity.

Recommendation Table 1 — Recommendations for
selection of surgical approach and impact on risk


3.3. Patient-related risk

3.3.1. Initial assessment

Patient-related risk is determined by patient’s age, the presence or
absence of CV risk factors (e.g. smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, family disposition) [40] or established CV disease, and
comorbidities. [41]

Identification of patients at risk of CV complications is of paramount importance to choice of therapy when non-surgical options
are available, or when the type of surgery or anaesthesia impacts
the risk of complications. When emergency surgery is needed, the
evaluation must necessarily be limited; however, most clinical circumstances allow a systematic approach.
As an initial assessment, it is recommended that all patients scheduled for NCS are evaluated by accurate history and physical examination, with special emphasis on CV risk factors, established CV
disease, and comorbidities. [40] It is also recommended to measure

standard laboratory tests (e.g. haemoglobin and renal function) in all
patients undergoing intermediate- to high-risk surgery. Based on this
information, further assessment of patient-related risk can proceed
depending on the surgery-related risk, as shown in Figure 2. It is recommended to perform an electrocardiogram (ECG), assess the functional
capacity, and/or measure biomarkers (cardiac troponins and/or
N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]/B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]) depending on the patient-related and
surgery-related risk (Figure 2). Detailed information on available tools
for risk assessment, their prognostic ability, and indications to perform
them is given in Section 4. More details on pre-operative management
of patients with specific CV diseases are given in Section 6.

3.3.1.1. Patients aged,65 years without a history of
cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors
Patients aged,65 years without signs, symptoms, or history of CVD
or CV risk factors are considered to be of low risk, and can proceed
to low- and moderate-risk surgery without additional pre-operative
risk assessment. [41] Before high-risk surgery, ECG and biomarkers
should be considered (see Sections 4.3 and 4.4). [42]

Patients without signs or symptoms of CVD, but with a family history of genetic cardiomyopathy (i.e. dilatated, hypertrophic, arrhythmic, or restrictive cardiomyopathy, or LV non-compaction) should
be evaluated with an ECG and an echocardiographic examination
to rule out the presence of the disease, irrespective of the age. [43]

No specific data are available in the literature regarding risk of family
members without the phenotype; however, they are at risk of developing the disease, which may be subclinical at the time of the NCS. [43]

3.3.1.2. Patients aged ≥65 years or with cardiovascular risk
factors
Patients who are aged ≥65 years and patients with risk factors for
CVD—such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, or smoking—have an
increased risk of having undetected CVD. The SCORE2 riskprediction tool can be used to estimate their 10 year CVD risk
outside the setting of NCS. [40] Patients who are aged ≥65 years
and patients with risk factors for CVD also have an increased
risk of peri-operative complications during NCS. [41][,][44] These
patients need additional assessment before intermediate- and
high-risk surgery (Figure 2) and optimal treatment of risk factors.

This is also the case for patients with other diseases known to be
associated with a high risk of concomitant undetected or known
CVD (Sections 6.8 and 6.11–6.14).

3.3.1.3. Patients with established cardiovascular disease

The surgical procedure has the potential to aggravate the disease
and increase morbidity and mortality in patients with established


CVD. This may be preventable by implementing appropriate CV
risk stratification prior to NCS and individually tailoring
peri-operative therapy to reduce the risk. [45] If time allows, it is
also recommended to optimize guideline-recommended treat
ment of the disease before NCS. See Section 6 for a detailed

discussion of risk assessment and management of patients with

known CVD.

3.3.2. Patients with murmurs, chest pain, dyspnoea,
or peripheral oedema

Patients without known CVD and scheduled for elective or acute

NCS are often referred to a cardiologist because of symptoms or
signs that may be caused by CVD. Murmurs, chest pain, dyspnoea,
and oedema may suggest severe CVD, but may also be caused by
non-cardiac disease. Thus, the medical history, family history, and
risk factors have to be obtained and considered. The patient’s physical capacity should be assessed. The need for further evaluation of
the patient should be decided according to the risk of the planned
procedure or surgery.

3.3.2.1. Murmurs

In a patient with a heart murmur, but without any symptoms of CVD,
the value of performing an echocardiogram is not well-established
and consensus is missing. [54][–][56] However, if a heart murmur suggesting
clinically significant pathology is present before high-risk NCS, it is recommended to perform an echocardiogram, even in patients without any symptoms of CVD. Old age or increased NT-proBNP may


increase the pre-test probability of haemodynamically significant
but asymptomatic valvular disease. If the patient with the murmur
also has symptoms of CVD, an echocardiogram is indicated before
all NCS. The pre-operative setting is challenging, as the need for
NCS and the risk of CVD have to be considered as independent factors. Thus, an echocardiogram may be useful in risk stratification for
some patients, but whether it would improve outcome is uncertain.
It is important to bear in mind that the time delay when performing
additional but unnecessary examinations may worsen the patient’s
prognosis. [57] It has also been discussed that a focused cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) could replace auscultation in general in the preoperative evaluation of patients. [58] While cardiac auscultation has severe limitations, [59][,][60] the value of performing a FOCUS as a standard
pre-operative evaluation remains uncertain. Cardiac auscultation
should not be replaced by FOCUS.

3.3.2.2. Chest pain
Patients scheduled for NCS may also present with previously unrecognized symptoms suggestive of CAD. The disease leading to the
need for NCS may aggravate a subclinical CAD, or the patient may
have a concomitant undetected CAD. In an elective setting, if the
symptoms are suggestive of CAD, the guidelines for CAD patients
in the non-surgical setting should be followed (see Sections 4.5.3
and 6.1.2). If immediate, urgent, or time-sensitive NCS is needed,
the time for and access to adequate diagnostic tools may be limited.
However, ECG and troponins can be used to detect or exclude ACS
(see Sections 4.3 and 4.4).

3.3.2.3. Dyspnoea
Dyspnoea is a symptom of a wide range of diseases and conditions. In
a large series of patients, self-reported dyspnoea identified a subgroup of otherwise asymptomatic patients at increased risk of death
from CVD and any cause. [61] In the diagnostic work-up to find the reason for dyspnoea, spirometry, D-dimer, NT-proBNP/BNP, arterial
blood gases, and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) have diagnostic utility [61] but limited specificity. If NT-proBNP/BNP is elevated,
an echocardiogram should be performed. If NT-proBNP/BNP is not
elevated, other reasons for dyspnoea should be explored.

3.3.2.4. Peripheral oedema
Increased hydrostatic pressure leading to oedema is a feature of a
wide range of CV diseases, but an upright position is also a common
cause of oedema. There is a spectrum of other diseases that can result in peripheral oedema not listed here.

3.4. Timing of adequate risk evaluation
Pre-operative CV assessment should be performed prior to surgery,
ideally at the time when the decision for NCS has been made.
Accurate estimates of the risks and benefits of surgery is a prerequisite
for informed decision-making by both physicians and patients about the
appropriateness of surgery. These estimates should also help in guiding
surgical (endovascular/endoscopic vs. open approach) and monitoring
(intermediate care, screening for CV complications) approaches, and
help to detect an unexpectedly high CV risk. [47] Therefore, the prognostic value of pre-operative CV risk assessment is much higher in elective
vs. immediate or urgent surgery. Explicit communication of perioperative CV risk, on the basis of the expected event rates, [47] and risk
communication tools such as the A to Z Inventory of Decision Aids
[(https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/AZinvent.php) are recommended.](https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/AZinvent.php)

3.5. Avoidance or allowance for surgery
in the individual patient
In the clinical setting it can be difficult to decide whether CVD represents a contraindication to NCS. In general, the risk for the patient if
not operated on must be considerably higher than the risk of the
treatment. Ideally, an unstable cardiac patient should be stabilized before NCS, but waiting can be detrimental for acute surgical disease.
No definite list can be made for which cardiac disease is a clear contraindication to NCS, but in patients with severe HF (New York Heart


Association [NYHA] class IV), cardiogenic shock, severe pulmonary
hypertension, or patients with severe frailty (see Section 4.1.2 for
frailty assessment), high-risk NCS should probably be avoided. Life expectancy and quality of life should also be taken into consideration.

However, the decision should be made after discussions between

the surgeon, anaesthesiologist, cardiologist, and also a geriatrician
for elderly patients, along with the patient and relatives.

3.6. The patient perspective
Patients with established CVD may face concerns about their underlying disease and current CV medication, co-ordination between the
surgical team and their cardiologist (examples provided in Figure 3),
and the potential excessive risk compared with the expected outcome of the surgery. Time should be allowed to address concerns
and to provide evidence-based information on the risk–benefit
trade-offs and the surgical treatment options (including non-surgical
or ‘do nothing’ alternatives) to ensure informed consent, and to allow patients to engage in shared decision-making with the aim of supporting the best decision. The team needs to understand the
patient’s concerns and expectations about the treatment and shortand long-term goals, as the risk-benefits of the intervention may not
be aligned with patient preferences and wishes. Communicating in
plain language (oral and written) and targeting communication to
fit the individual level of health literacy is pivotal. Several studies
have indicated a relatively high prevalence of limited health literacy
in patients with CVD (e.g. with HF), [62] and limited health literacy is
associated with adverse outcomes. [63] An example of a patient information sheet to be used in the communication with patients is given
[in the Supplementary data, Table S1.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data)
Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have focused on
shared decision-making in the field of surgery across disease
areas. [64][–][67] In general, shared decision-making positively impacts decisional conflicts, knowledge gained, satisfaction, and decisional anxiety (although cultural variations may exist). [67] In the breast cancer/
endocrine and urology specialties, decision-making and communication aids appear to be effective methods for supporting patients’ involvement in decision-making when undergoing elective surgery.
Moreover, educational information, provided through interactive
multimedia, computer, or on DVD, used prior to the surgical consultation could enhance the decision-making process in addition to
face-to-face communication. [66]

In Europe, the prevalence of pre-operative anxiety among patients
undergoing surgical procedures varies from 27–80%. [68] Although a
certain level of anxiety in patients must be expected, peri-operative
anxiety is associated with worse surgical outcomes and longer recovery, [69][–][72] which highlights the importance of pre-surgical assessment
and, in some patients, treatment of anxiety. Factors associated with
pre-operative anxiety are complex and include, among others, age,
sex, educational level, type of surgery, and fear of post-operative
complications or the outcome. [68] Psychological reactions in patients

–
undergoing high- or medium high-risk procedures and/or patients
with previous negative experiences of NCS may warrant particular
attention. Concerns and fears expressed by patients and relatives
should be taken seriously. A number of reviews and meta-analyses
have summarized the effects of interventions on surgical outcomes in
abdominal, cardiac, and orthopaedic surgery, which may also be applicable to patients with CV conditions in these settings. [73][–][75]

4.1.1. General risk calculators

Several risk indices have been developed based on multivariable analyses
of observational data and have been validated during the last decade
(Table 6). [47][,][49][,][76] Most risk calculators integrate both patient-related
and surgery-related risk factors, but none of them include biomarkers
among their variables. Calculators for most of the commonly used risk
indices are available online (Table 6). The risk calculators can be used in
addition, or as an alternative, to the assessment of surgery-related and
patient-related risk factors described in Section 3.3. The Task Force
decided against recommending one specific risk score. The Task Force
also decided that the selection criteria for further pre-operative testing
should be clinical criteria, and not based on a specific score.

The RCRI estimates the risk of 30 day mortality, MI, or
cardiac arrest, and is based on six variables. [46][,][47] It has been
validated in several countries and is easy to use. [47] A score of
0 indicates a 4% risk of 30 day mortality, MI, or cardiac arrest; a


score of 1 indicates a 6% risk; a score of 2, 10%; and a score of
≥3, 15%. [47]

The American College of Surgery National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) developed an interactive risk

ESC Guidelines 3849


calculator providing an estimate of the absolute 30 day probability of
serious complications and any complications compared with the
average patient. [76] Evaluated in the US surgical database, the ACS
NSQIP model performed better than the RCRI, but an external validation in the Philippines found both to have excellent discriminative
abilities for predicting any MACE. [48] The RCRI can be used without a
web connection, whereas the ACS NSQIP is procedure-specific and
is only available on the web. For clinical use, the RCRI is more accessible, but the ACS NSQIP offers procedure-specific absolute risk estimates, which are valuable in patient-guided decision-making. In
vascular surgery, both risk calculators have shown moderate accur
–
acy with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.57 0.70) for

–
ACS NSQIP and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.54 0.65) for RCRI, due to underestimation of the risk of MI. [76a] Attempts to generate procedurespecific vascular calculators have not given better predictions in validation cohorts. [77]

The Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT) estimates 30 day mortality after NCS based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists

–
Physical Status (ASA PS) grade, urgency of surgery, surgical speciality
and severity, cancer, and age ≥65 years. In the validation study, combining subjective assessment with the SORT was significantly better
than using either alone. [78][,][79] The Surgical Risk Calculator is another
tool that predicts intra-operative and 30 day risk of MI or cardiac ar
–
rest based on age, ASA PS grade, pre-operative dependent functional status, creatinine, and type of surgery. [80]

The American University of Beirut (AUB)-HAS2 Cardiovascular
Risk Index is the most recently developed index to assess 30 day
event risk (death, MI, or stroke), and stratifies patients undergoing

– –
NCS into low (score 0 1), intermediate (score 2 3), and high risk
(score .3) based on six data elements (see Table 6); scores .3 denote a post-operative event rate of .10%. [49] The AUB-HAS2 Index
has been tested in a broad spectrum of surgical subpopulations and
demonstrated superior discriminatory power compared with the
commonly utilized RCRI (Table 6). [50][,][51][,][81]

There is significant variability in the predicted risk of cardiac complications using different risk-prediction tools; none can be disqualified with current evidence. [82]

4.1.2. Frailty
Frailty is an age-related, multidimensional state of decreased physiological reserve that results in diminished resiliency, loss of adaptive
capacity, and increased vulnerability to stressors. [83][,][84] The perioperative evaluation of elderly patients (.70 years) who require
elective intermediate- or high-risk NCS should include frailty screening, which has proven to be an excellent predictor of unfavourable
health outcomes in the older surgical population.
Frailty has a relevant impact on mortality and MI risk but does not
add to risk estimation derived from the ACS NSQIP calculator, as

frailty is associated with variables already in the main model. By adding six variables, the ACS NSQIP predicts the risk of post-operative
delirium, functional decline, need of a new mobility aid, or pressure
ulcer. [85] The use of this broader-inclusive score identifies cases that
profit the most by involving a geriatrician in the pre- and postoperative team. [86][,][87] A measure of frailty informs the patient and surgeon about further life expectancy and the chance of post-operative
delirium, dependency of mobility support, and need of nursing home
or other care support after planned surgery.


Of the available screening tools for frailty, the Frailty Index and the
Frail Phenotype are the most commonly recommended. [88][,][89] Of note,
the Frailty Index includes cognitive testing, while both scores assess
physical function. [90][,][91] A simpler approach is offered by the Clinical
Frailty Scale, which relies on information from the history taking. The
Clinical Frailty Scale has been validated against the Frailty Index. [88] For
cognitive screening to incorporate with the Frailty Index, Mini-Cog [©]

is a simple and fast screening tool validated for pre-operative screening [92] [(Supplementary data, Figure S1, and Tables S2 and S3).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data)
Once a diagnosis of frailty is confirmed, the prognosis of a frail patient
can be improved by shared decision-making between at least a treating
physician (e.g. surgeon), anaesthesiologist, geriatrician, the patient, and
the patient’s relatives. During the shared decision-making process, a
careful discussion with a frail patient about goals of care could help
them to have realistic expectations and make better informed decisions
before surgery. After a shared decision to go ahead with a planned NCS,

—
multimodal pre-habilitation programmes including exercise, nutrition,

—
and psychological interventions could potentially improve the perioperative prognosis of frail patients by an individualized approach
tailored to the patient’s baseline functional status, comorbidities, and
cognitive/psychological function. [90]

4.2. Functional capacity
Quantifying functional capacity has been a pivotal step in preoperative cardiac risk assessment. [10] Although the validity of
interview-based assessment of functional capacity has been questioned, [93] a recent large prospective cohort study of high-risk patients
undergoing NCS found self-reported inability to climb two flights of
stairs added incremental value to the 30 day cardiac event rate when
added to the RCRI. [94]

Metabolic equivalents (METs),4 have long been considered to
indicate poor functional capacity; however, studies using METs
have been based on subjective interviews and not shown proven value. In the Measurement of Exercise Tolerance before Surgery
[(METS) study, the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) (https://www.](https://www.mdcalc.com/duke-activity-status-index-dasi#evidence)
[mdcalc.com/duke-activity-status-index-dasi#evidence) had a more](https://www.mdcalc.com/duke-activity-status-index-dasi#evidence)
precise estimation of cardiac risk than subjectively assessed functional capacity, improving risk estimation using RCRI. [95] A DASI score
,34 was associated with increased odds of 30 day death or MI. [96]

From the DASI score, METs can be calculated as VO 2 max (maximal
oxygen consumption)/3.5; where VO 2 max (mL/kg/min) = 0.43 ×
DASI + 9.6. Furthermore, cardiopulmonary exercise testing
(CPET) did not predict 30 day mortality, post-operative MI, or cardiac arrest. [94][,][95] It should be noted that a relatively low number of primary outcome events limited the statistical power of the analysis.

4.3. Electrocardiography
The 12-lead ECG is a widely available, simple, and inexpensive tool
that is able to semi-quantitatively assess cardiac risk (e.g. Q waves indicative of previous MI), and detect unknown CV conditions requiring therapy (e.g. atrial fibrillation [AF] or AV-block). [97][–][99] It is
recommended to obtain a pre-operative 12-lead ECG in patients
who are aged ≥65 years or have known CVD, CV risk factors, or


symptoms suggestive of cardiac disorders, and scheduled to undergo
intermediate- or high-risk surgery. It is not recommended to routinely obtain a pre-operative ECG in low-risk patients undergoing lowrisk NCS. [100]

Comparison with previous ECG recordings is helpful whenever
relevant abnormalities are identified. Pre-operative recording of
ECG also enables identification of intra- and post-operative ECG
changes.

4.4. Biomarkers

As the peri-operative risk for cardiac complications depends on the
presence and extent of cardiac disease, widely available and simple
biomarkers that detect and quantify essential prognostic aspects of
cardiac involvement may aid in the evaluation. High-sensitivity cardiac
troponin T/I (Hs-cTn T/I) quantifies myocardial injury, and BNP and
NT-proBNP quantify haemodynamic cardiac wall stress (Figure 4).











Figure 4 Recommended measurements to assess and detect the risk of post-operative cardiac complications. ECG, electrocardiogram; hs-cTn, highsensitivity cardiac troponin; PMI, peri-operative myocardial infarction/injury; ULN, upper limit of normal. In patients scheduled to undergo intermediate- or
high-risk surgery, pre-operative risk assessment is complemented by ECG, hs-cTn, and BNP/NT-proBNP. An absolute increase in hs-cTn concentration of
more than the ULN on days 1 or 2 after surgery compared to the pre-operative level is defined as PMI. [109][–][111] In the absence of a pre-operative hs-cTn T/I
concentration, a very high hs-cTn T/I concentration on day 1 (e.g. more than five-times the ULN) or a relevant change from day 1 to day 2 (absolute increase
or decrease more than the ULN vs. day 1) would also achieve a reliable diagnosis of PMI. Detection of PMI should trigger ECG recording and detailed clinical
evaluation for PMI work-up and therapy. The differential diagnosis of PMI according to the fourth universal definition of MI is discussed in Section 8. The ESC
0/1/2 h algorithm has not been validated for the peri-operative setting and cannot be used here.

ESC Guidelines 3851


Both Hs-cTn T/I and BNP/NT-proBNP complement clinical assessment and ECG in risk prediction. [9][,][52][,][53][,][101][–][103] Hs-cTn T/I and, to a
lesser extent, BNP/NT-proBNP concentrations are higher in patients with stress-induced myocardial ischaemia vs. those without,
and very low hs-cTn T/I concentrations achieve a very high negative
predictive value to rule out myocardial ischaemia. [104][–][107]

Several large prospective studies have shown that both hs-cTn T/I
and BNP/NT-proBNP have high and incremental prognostic value
for peri-operative cardiac complications, including CV death, cardiac
arrest, acute HF, and tachyarrhythmias. In a cohort of nearly 1000
subjects undergoing major elective NCS, individuals with preoperative hs-cTn T concentrations of .14 ng/L had an in-hospital
mortality of 6.9% vs. 1.2% in patients with hs-cTn T concentrations
≤14 ng/L (P, 0.001; AUC 0.81). [53] In a large prospective cohort
study including 10 402 patients from 16 centres, NT-proBNP improved risk predication beyond the RCRI. [52] Among 1923 patients
undergoing NCS, NT-proBNP outperformed both RCRI and echocardiographic parameters in the prediction of peri-operative CV
events. [103] Overall, hs-cTn T/I and BNP/NT-proBNP seem to have
comparable accuracy in the prediction of cardiac complications. [52][,][53][,][98][–][103][,][108] However, Hs-cTn T/I has four advantages over
BNP/NT-proBNP: (i) it is more widely available; (ii) it is less expensive; (iii) if normal, it enables acute MI to be ruled out in the preceding
days; and (iv) availability of pre-operative hs-cTn T/I concentration
enables accurate diagnosis of PMI on Day 1 after surgery. [109][–][111]

See Section 8 for more details on diagnosis and treatment of PMI.
B-type natriuretic peptide/NT-proBNP has two advantages. First,
if elevated, evidence from randomized controlled screening studies
performed outside the peri-operative setting has supported the con
                                         cept that BNP/NT-proBNP-triggered cardiac work-up and intensifi
cation of therapy improve outcomes. [112][,][113] Second, HF is a
frequently undiagnosed condition in the elderly population most often undergoing NCS. [47][,][114] Interpreting BNP/NT-proBNP concentrations as quantitative markers of HF with evolving rule-in cut-offs
may facilitate detection of HF, optimal intra-operative monitoring,
and initiation or optimization of HF therapy after surgery. [114]

To date, there is insufficient evidence in support of other CV biomarkers for this specific indication. [115][,][116]

cardiac disease should also be considered when interpreting the pre-operative
concentration. [98]

Abnormal BNP: ≥35 pg/mL; abnormal NT-proBNP: ≥125 pg/mL. BNP/NT-proBNP
should be interpreted as quantitative markers of heart failure, and also take into
account age, sex, obesity, and known cardiac disease. [52][,][114] Please note that age, renal
dysfunction, and obesity are important confounders in the age group in which
measurement of BNP/NT-proBNP is recommended, while sex has less impact.

4.5. Non-invasive and invasive

procedures
4.5.1. Resting transthoracic echocardiography
In large retrospective cohorts, routine pre-operative TTE before
high-risk NCS did not reduce the risk of post-operative MACE or
provide more information than clinical risk models. [120][–][122] Poor
exercise tolerance, abnormal ECG, suspected new or significant
CVDs without follow-up within the last 90 days, unexplained
dyspnoea, or coexisting clinical risk factors are appropriate
indications for TTE. [123][,][124] Pre-operative TTE provides information on three main risk markers for post-operative cardiac events:
LV dysfunction, VHDs, and cardiomyopathies. Left ventricular
systolic dysfunction is an important predictor of post-operative
HF. [125] However, low ventricular ejection fraction is a
borderline independent predictor of major post-operative CV
complications. [126][–][128]

Pre-operative FOCUS examination—with a hand-held ultrasound
device for the assessment of murmurs, haemodynamic instability,

—
ventricular function, and dyspnea may impact patient management
by improving the diagnostic accuracy of clinical assessment, and help
to triage candidates for standard TTE, plan surgery and anaesthesia
technique, and with post-operative monitoring. [129][–][131] However,
current evidence remains mostly confined to uncontrolled or retrospective observational studies with no clear benefits on the outcome,
despite a favourable impact on peri-operative management. [130][,][132] In
a multicentre randomized trial, preliminary results showed that preoperative FOCUS significantly reduced all-cause mortality. [133]

Notably, because of the lack of spectral Doppler capabilities, the
FOCUS examination is only accurate for assessing main structural

and functional abnormalities.

Patients with diastolic dysfunction are usually old, more hypertensive, obese, diabetic, and likely to have AF or chronic renal disease.
Several studies with different clinical end-points have underlined

3852 ESC Guidelines


the association of diastolic dysfunction with post-operative adverse
events, including pulmonary oedema, AF, and mortality. [134][–][138] A
meta-analysis including 3876 patients undergoing NCS found preoperative diastolic dysfunction to be an independent risk factor for
pulmonary oedema, congestive HF, and MI after surgery. [139]

However, a recent retrospective study, including 7312 patients,
showed no association between the degree of diastolic
dysfunction and in-hospital mortality or hospital length of stay in
NCS patients. [140] Awareness of diastolic dysfunction or high LV filling
pressure (e.g. pulmonary hypertension, left atrial volume, E/e [′] ratio)

seems necessary to optimize peri-operative patient management;
however, evidence does not support screening for diastolic
dysfunction.

4.5.2. Stress tests

4.5.2.1. Exercise stress test

Physical exercise, using a treadmill or bicycle ergometer, provides an
estimate of functional capacity, evaluates blood pressure (BP) and
heart rate response, and detects myocardial ischaemia through

–
pathological ST-segment changes with poor sensitivity (61 73%)
and specificity (60–80%). [146] An exercise stress test alone should
only be considered a valuable alternative to diagnose obstructive
CAD if non-invasive imaging tests are unavailable. [146] An exercise
stress test is of no diagnostic value in patients with pre-existing
ST-segment abnormalities (i.e. left bundle branch block, paced


rhythm, Wolff–Parkinson–White [WPW] syndrome, ≥0.1 mV
ST-segment depression on resting ECG, or taking digitalis). In addition, an exercise test is unsuitable for patients with limited exercise
capacity, owing to their inability to reach their target heart rate.
Therefore, an exercise stress test alone should only be considered
a valuable alternative to diagnose obstructive CAD if non-invasive
imaging tests are unavailable, or for assessing functional capacity
when clinical history is ambiguous. [146]

4.5.2.2. Stress imaging
The use of stress imaging is appropriate for risk assessment in patients with clinical risk factors and poor functional capacity. [147][,][148]

The choice of the test is driven by local expertise. Selection, optimal,
and safe performance of stress imaging should comply with related
guidelines and recommendations. [146][,][148][,][149] Stress imaging is not recommended in patients undergoing urgent surgery or with an unstable clinical condition. Evidence on the role of stress imaging for
peri-operative risk prediction and patient management is largely
based on inducible ischaemia by pharmacological stress testing, although no evidence indicates the superiority of pharmacological
stress to exercise stress imaging in patients who are able to perform
an adequate level of physical exercise. Several studies and
meta-analyses have consistently defined clinical utility of pharmacological stress imaging for peri-operative risk assessment in patients
undergoing NCS. [150][–][154] Although RCTs related to post-operative
outcome are lacking, there are large-scale prospective studies showing a risk-adjusted association of stress imaging results with perioperative cardiac complications. [155][–][157]

Studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated similar prognostic
value of stress echocardiography and myocardial perfusion imaging
for peri-operative risk assessment with slightly higher negative predictive value of stress echocardiography, [152] but the overall accuracy
varies with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) prevalence. [151] A
moderate-to-large perfusion defect on either test is highly sensitive
for post-operative cardiac events. [152][,][158] Normal stress imaging exams without resting abnormalities have high negative predictive value. [159][,][160] However, positive predictive value of stress imaging for
peri-operative cardiac events is relatively low and requires confirmation by other tests. [150][,][152][,][161]

In a recent retrospective study including 4494 patients, dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) provided modest incremental
predictive value for peri-operative CV complications over clinical
variables and was found to be useful as part of a stepwise approach
in the risk stratification of patients undergoing intermediate- to highrisk NCS. [157] The strongest predictors of post-operative adverse
events determined so far are significant ischaemia (more than four
ventricular segments) during DSE, ischaemic threshold (60% of agepredicted maximal heart rate), and a history of congestive HF. [162][,][163]

A negative DSE without resting wall motion abnormality has excellent negative predictive value, even when target heart rate cannot
be achieved despite an aggressive DSE regimen. [164] In asymptomatic
patients if functional capacity is unknown, stress echocardiography
also enables dynamic evaluation of LV systolic and diastolic function;
valvular diseases such as aortic valve stenosis (AS), mitral valve stenosis (MS), and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; and pulmonary hypertension 165 However, the role of DSE for risk

ESC Guidelines 3853


estimation in non-ischaemic heart diseases before NCS has yet to be

studied.

Myocardial perfusion imaging is particularly suitable if patients have
poor acoustic windows for DSE. Meta-analyses of patients undergoing major NCS have demonstrated that, compared with fixed defects, reversible perfusion defects were associated with higher risk

of cardiac death or non-fatal MI. The risk of cardiac events correlates

with the extent of reversible perfusion abnormalities (severe: .20%
of myocardium). Normal myocardial perfusion imaging in high-risk
patients identifies a low-risk subgroup comparable with those without clinical risk factors for adverse cardiac outcomes. [154][,][159][,][160]

Stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and late gado
linium enhancement are also accurate tools for detection of IHD
and prognostication. [166]

e One or more clinical risk factor according to the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (ischaemic
heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, history of congestive heart failure, serum
creatinine level .2 mg/dL, diabetes requiring insulin therapy). [46][,][47]

4.5.3. Angiography
4.5.3.1. Coronary computed tomography angiography
Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is recommended as an initial test for diagnosing CAD in stable patients
with a low clinical likelihood or no previous diagnosis of CAD, and
characteristics associated with a high likelihood of good image quality. [146] In addition, CCTA is recommended as an alternative to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for excluding non-ST-segment
elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) when there is
low-to-intermediate likelihood of CAD, and when cardiac troponin
and/or ECG are normal or inconclusive. [98] The practical utility of
CCTA is reduced when a high coronary calcium score is present. [167]


In patients undergoing NCS, the role of pre-operative CCTA to
rule out CAD has been investigated in small- to medium-sized observational studies. The Coronary Computed Tomographic
Angiography and Vascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery Patients
Cohort Evaluation (Coronary CTA VISION) trial prospectively investigated the incremental predictive value of CCTA over RCRI in
955 patients with a history of or risk factors for CAD, or a history
of congestive HF undergoing NCS. [168] Coronary computed tomography angiography improved the risk estimation for the primary outcome of post-operative CV death and non-fatal MI within 30 days,
although CCTA was associated with more than five times inappropriate risk overestimations among patients not experiencing the primary outcome. The predictive value of CCTA further improved
when associated with non-invasive functional testing, such as myocardial perfusion imaging, with a positive and negative predictive va
– –
lue of 50% (95% CI, 21 79) and 100% (95% CI, 79 100),
respectively. [161]

Coronary computed tomography angiography associated with
additional functional assessment of coronary stenosis with fractional
flow reserve (FFR) with computed tomography (CT) was able to
identify functionally severe coronary stenosis in 57% of the asymptomatic patients with no history of cardiac disease undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). [169] In 135 asymptomatic patients with
no history of cardiac disease undergoing peripheral vascular surgery,
pre-operative FFR with CT facilitated the identification of functionally severe coronary stenosis in 53% of the patients. These patients
benefited from further revascularization, with a 1 year lower rate
of CV death and MI. [170]

4.5.3.2. Invasive coronary angiography
There is a lack of information from RCTs relating to the usefulness of
ICA in patients scheduled for NCS. Adopting an ICA assessment may
also cause an unnecessary and unpredictable delay in an already
planned surgical intervention, and adding an independent procedural
risk to the overall risk. Despite the fact that CAD may be present in a
significant number of patients requiring NCS, indications for preoperative coronary angiography and revascularization are similar to
angiography indications in the non-surgical setting. [98][,][146][,][171]

Pre-operative treatment of patients with myocardial ischaemia, either medically or with intervention, is recommended.

### 5. General risk-reduction strategies

5.1. Cardiovascular risk factors and

lifestyle interventions
Control of CV risk factors—including BP, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes

—
is important before NCS. For pre-operative management of BP
and diabetes, see Sections 6.8 and 6.13, respectively.
While lifestyle modifications before intervention reduce the risk of
several peri-operative complications, the impact on CV complications has not been adequately explored. Of the lifestyle changes recommended before surgery, smoking cessation is the best
documented in RCTs. Smoking has been associated with a higher
rate of post-operative complications at 30 days. [173][,][174] Reviews of
RCTs have shown an effect of smoking cessation up to 6 months
post-operatively, with a clear reduction in any post-operative com

plications by hazard ratio (HR) 0.42 (95% CI, 0.27 0.65), particularly

–
wound infections (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21 0.85). [173][,][175] Regarding
timing of cessation, reviews of observational studies have shown consistent associations with better surgical outcome for cessation .4
weeks before surgery, with each additional week resulting in a further improvement of 19%. [176][–][178]

Pre-operative exercise programmes have only been tested in small
RCTs, and recent reviews have shown a relative risk (RR) reduction

–
in post-operative complications of 67% (RR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17
0.61). [179] Referral to a pre-operative exercise programme may be
considered for patients scheduled for major or complex elective surgery. [176][,][179][,][180] Weight reduction of obese patients immediately prior
to surgery is not recommended.

Recommendation Table 11 — Recommendations for
lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors


5.2. Pharmacological

5.2.1. Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by reducing

contractile force and heart rate. Beta-blockers are also effective anti
arrhythmic agents. In addition, some beta-blockers such as metoprolol have an effect on acute inflammatory responses by inhibiting
neutrophil hyperactivation in acute settings. [184] These properties
mean that beta-blockers have been some of the most frequently
tested cardioprotective agents in patients undergoing NCS. Several
RCTs have evaluated the effects of peri-operative beta-blockade
on clinical end-points in patients with different risk profiles (see
[Supplementary data, Section 3.1.1.). Type, dosing and titration, timing](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data)
of initiation, duration of beta-blocker therapy, type of surgery, and
risk profile of subjects significantly differ between studies, making
comparisons complex.
The question about pre-surgery initiation of beta-blockers has been
a matter of intense controversy (see Supplementary data, Section
3.1.1.1). The largest and latest trial on the topic, the Perioperative
Ischemic Evaluation (POISE-1) trial, enrolled 8351 patients with or

at risk of atherosclerotic disease, and not on beta-blockers before

NCS. Patients were randomized to extended-release metoprolol succinate 200 mg daily or placebo [185] Treatment was initiated 2–4 h
before surgery and maintained for 30 days. The primary outcome
(composite of CV death, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal cardiac arrest)
was significantly lower in the metoprolol arm (5.8% vs. 6.9% [P =
0.04]). Metoprolol was associated with significant reductions in MIs,
coronary revascularizations, and AF. However, the incidences of allcause death, stroke, and clinically significant hypotension or bradycardia were significantly higher in the metoprolol arm. Post hoc analysis
showed that hypotension carried the greatest attributable risk of
death and stroke [186] The high dose of extended metoprolol might
have played a role in the adverse events seen at follow-up.
Several meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and observational stud[ies have also been reported (see Supplementary data, Table S4).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data) [187][–]

189 Overall, initiation of beta-blockers before NCS was not associated with a net clinical benefit in most analyses, but they might
be beneficial in patients with high CV risk profiles or who are undergoing high-risk surgical interventions (including vascular interventions). [188][,][190][–][192] When oral beta-blockade is initiated in CAD
patients who undergo NCS, the use of atenolol or bisoprolol as a
first choice may be considered. [190][,][193][–][195]

In patients who are on chronic beta-blocker therapy before
surgery, it is recommended to maintain these in the peri-operative
period. Increased mortality following pre-operative beta-blocker
withdrawal has been reported in five observational studies. [190][,][196][–][199]

Interruption of this therapy for .2 days post-operatively may double
the risk of AF. [200]

Post-operative tachycardia should initially lead to treatment of the

—
underlying cause such as hypovolaemia, pain, blood loss, or infection—rather than simply increasing the beta-blocker dose. When
beta-blockers are indicated, the optimal duration of the perioperative beta-blockade cannot be derived from randomized trials.
According to a meta-analysis of RCTs including 14 967 patients,
beta-blockers can reduce the risk of post-operative AF after
NCS; [201] however, this comes at the cost of an increased risk of
bradycardia, hypotension, and stroke. [187]

ESC Guidelines 3855


The ultra-short-acting beta-blockers esmolol and landiolol have
the theoretical advantages of very fast onset of effects and short halflives. Notably, landiolol may lower BP to a lower extent than
esmolol. Evidence of prevention of AF with landiolol after NCS is

less robust and inconsistent than in the context of cardiac surgery. [202][–][205] The timing of the initiation of beta-blockers to prevent
AF remains unclear, with most prophylactic regimens using shortacting agents being started intra-operatively. [187]

5.2.2. Amiodarone

Amiodarone is the most frequently used agent for prevention of
post-operative AF, [206] with a risk reduction of 58% in NCS in a
meta-analysis evaluating different antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs), but
may induce relevant non-cardiac side effects. [201] In another
meta-analysis, amiodarone (oral or intravenous [i.v.]) and betablockers were equally effective in reducing post-operative AF. [207] In
another prospective RCT, a combination of beta-blocker plus amiodarone outperformed beta-blockers alone in reducing postoperative AF. [208] It should be noted that the two latter studies
were undertaken in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
Overall, while preventive amiodarone seems to reduce the incidence of AF, the clinical benefits associated with its routine use are

unclear.

5.2.3. Statins

Despite the wide-ranging use of statins in patients undergoing surgery, RCTs assessing the effects of initiating statin therapy during
the peri-operative period are scarce. This should be viewed separately from patients already on statin therapy. The long-term use of
statins in patients with CVD or high risk of CVD is well-established. [40]

Observational data suggest a potential benefit of statins in the
peri-operative phase. In a large, retrospective, and observational cohort, which included 180 000 veterans undergoing NCS, the use of
statins on the day of or the day after surgery was associated with a
reduction in mortality (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.89). [209] Similar results were seen in a retrospective cohort study using hospital discharge and pharmacy records. [210] Although both studies used
propensity matching to reduce bias, these analyses are prone to confounding, especially when discharge and pharmacy records are used.
As such, RCTs give a more reliable effect estimation, for example: the
Lowering the Risk of Operative Complications Using Atorvastatin
Loading Dose (LOAD) trial studied 648 statin-naïve patients, of
whom 24% had a history of CVD and 49% had diabetes. [211] In this
randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients received a loading
dose of atorvastatin 80 mg within 18 h before surgery followed by
40 mg daily for 7 days. Use of atorvastatin did not reduce the risk
of major events (all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, or stroke at 30
days [HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.60–1.26; P = 0.46]). However, the trial
was underpowered to draw definite conclusions. In addition, several
meta-analyses have shown ambiguous results and most studies are of
a limited size with less than 100 patients. [212][,][213]

Therefore, routine peri-operative initiation of statin therapy is
not recommended. However, in patients in whom statin use is already indicated, treatment should be considered peri-operatively,
particularly in patients scheduled for high-risk surgery (e.g. vascular
surgery).


5.2.4. Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
inhibitors

– –
Data on peri-operative use of renin angiotensin aldosterone system
(RAAS) inhibitors are inconclusive. The majority of studies suggest
that continued use of RAAS inhibitors is associated with a higher
risk of peri-operative hypotension and, as a consequence, higher
use of vasopressors and inotropes. Furthermore, intra-operative
hypotension and its duration is associated with end-organ damage,
including kidney injury, myocardial damage, and stroke. [214] In a small
trial of 275 subjects, randomized to either continuation of their
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or omission of
the final pre-operative ACEI dose, patients randomized to omission
of the last dose before surgery experienced intra-operative hypotension less frequently (76/137 [55%] vs. 95/138 [69%]) and vasopressor
use was less likely. [215] On the other hand, post-operative hypertension was more frequent in the omission group. Furthermore, in an
observational cohort study consisting of 4802 patients undergoing
NCS and using an ACEI or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), discontinuation of these drugs in the 24 h before surgery was associated
with a lower risk of intra-operative hypotension (adjusted RR, 0.80;
95% CI, 0.72–0.93; P, 0.001), and associated with a reduction in the
composite end-point consisting of all-cause mortality, stroke, and MI
(adjusted RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.96; P = 0.01); [216] 8% of the patients in this cohort were diagnosed with HF, in whom RAAS inhibitors are the cornerstone of medical therapy. A systematic review,
including nine studies (five RCTs and four cohort studies), revealed
that withholding ACEI/ARB on the morning of surgery was not associated with mortality or MACE; [217] however, it did confirm that withholding therapy was associated with less intra-operative hypotension

–
(OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 0.85). If an ACEI/ARB is withheld prior to
NCS, it should be restarted as soon as possible in order to prevent
unintended long-term omission. No data on peri-operative effects of
angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) exist, but hypotension is more common compared with patients on ACEI. [218]

–
Some important RCTs in this field are ongoing: the impact of renin
angiotensin system inhibitors continuation vs. discontinuation on outcome after major surgery trial STOPorNOT [219] (NCT03374449),
and the POISE-3 trial (NCT03505723) are both assessing a
hypotension-avoidance strategy vs. a hypertension-avoidance strategy
on the risk of vascular death and major vascular events in patients who
are followed for 30 days after NCS.

5.2.5. Calcium channel blockers

The effects of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) on the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand makes them theoretically suitable for risk-reduction strategies. The relevance of
randomized trials assessing the peri-operative effects of CCBs is
limited by their small size, lack of risk stratification, and the absence
of systematic reporting of cardiac death and MI. A meta-analysis
pooled 11 randomized trials totalling 1007 patients. [220] Treatment
with CCBs significantly reduced the number of episodes of
myocardial ischaemia and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in the
pooled analyses. However, the decrease in mortality and MI reached
statistical significance only when both end-points were combined
(RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.08–0.83; P = 0.02). In contrast, a matched casecontrol study of 1000 patients undergoing acute or elective

3856 ESC Guidelines


aortic aneurysm surgery suggested that dihydropyridine use was independently associated with an increased incidence of peri-operative
mortality. [221] These observational data may be biased by the
indications for the use of CCBs. In patients already on CCBs,
particularly in those with vasospastic angina, it is recommended to
continue CCBs during the peri-operative period, but withholding
the dose on the day of surgery in order to avoid post-operative
hypotension.

5.2.6. Alpha-2 receptor agonists
Alpha-2 receptor agonists reduce post-ganglionic noradrenaline
output and might therefore reduce catecholamine surge during
surgery. The European Mivazerol trial randomized 1897 patients
with IHD who underwent intermediate- or high-risk NCS. [222]

Mivazerol did not decrease the incidence of death or MI in the

whole population. However, it did decrease the incidence of death
in a subpopulation of 904 patients undergoing vascular surgery. [222]

The international Peri-Operative ISchemic Evaluation 2 (POISE-2)
trial randomized 10 010 patients undergoing NCS to clonidine
or placebo. [223] Clonidine did not reduce the rate of death or nonfatal MI in general or in patients undergoing vascular surgery (RR,
1.08; 95% Cl, 0.93–1.26; P = 0.29), but it did increase the risk

–
of clinically important hypotension (RR, 1.32; 95% Cl, 1.24 1.40;
P, 0.001) and non-fatal cardiac arrest (RR, 3.20; 95% Cl, 1.17–
8.73; P = 0.02).

5.2.7. Diuretics

Diuretics are frequently used in patients with hypertension or HF. In
general, therapy for treatment of hypertension should be continued
to the day of surgery and resumed orally when possible. However,
the benefit for continuing diuretics as antihypertensive therapy is unclear, and alternative antihypertensive agents may be considered. In
HF, the dosage of diuretics should be adjusted well in advance for
an optimal fluid balance before surgery, and to avoid fluid retention
or dehydration.
The possibility of electrolyte disturbance should be considered in
any patient receiving diuretics. Hypokalaemia is reported to occur in
up to 36% of patients undergoing surgery (mostly NCS). [224][,][225]

Special attention should be given to patients prone to developing arrhythmias. Any electrolyte disturbance, especially hypokalemia and
hypomagnesaemia, should be corrected in due time before surgery.
Acute pre-operative repletion in asymptomatic patients may be associated with more risks than benefits; thus, minor asymptomatic
electrolyte disturbances should not delay acute surgery.
In the peri-operative period, volume status in patients with HF
should be carefully monitored and optimized by loop diuretics or
fluids. However, retrospective data suggest that intra-operative prescription of diuretics may increase the risk of acute kidney injury
(AKI) after NCS. [226]

5.2.8. Ivabradine

Heart rate is an independent and modifiable risk factor for periprocedural MI (and maybe death) after NCS. Ivabradine is a negative
chronotropic agent without associated hypotensive effect, and is


therefore a possible alternative to beta-blockers. However, there
are few studies about the value of ivabradine for high-risk patients
undergoing NCS. [227] The small (78 patients) PeRi-OperaTivE
CardioproTection With Ivabradine in Non-cardiac Surgery
(PROTECTIN) (NCT04436016) trial is ongoing.

5.2.9. Sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors
The use of sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors is
increasing, due to proven CV benefits for patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and a beneficial effect on outcomes for patients
with HF and renal insufficiency. Euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis
(EDKA) is a rare but serious complication. While the incidence
was not significantly increased with SGLT-2 inhibitors in RCTs, several case reports indicate that EDKA may occasionally occur after
(non-cardiac) surgery in patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors. [228] A systematic review indicated that precipitating factors include diabetes medication changes, diet modifications, and intercurrent illnesses. [229] The
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends interrupting

–
SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy for at least 3 4 days before scheduled surgery and to be vigilant for symptoms related to EDKA, prompting

measurement of ketones.

5.3. Peri-operative handling of
antithrombotic agents
Management of patients taking antithrombotic agents and needing surgery or an invasive procedure should consider patient- and
procedure-related risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Furthermore, the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the


antithrombotic drugs in use must be considered (Tables 7 and 8). The
risk of bleeding associated with different types of interventions is shown
in Table 9. Risk estimation and decision-making in patients requiring
long-term antithrombotic therapy is challenging, since relevant associations exist between peri-operative antithrombotic management, bleeding, thrombotic events (MI and stroke), and mortality. [6][,][11][–][13] Thus,
interdisciplinary risk assessment ahead of the intervention is crucial, in order to classify the patient-related ischaemic and bleeding
risks (e.g. cardiologist, neurologist, vascular specialist, and haematologist), and the surgical risk (surgeon and anaesthesiologist).
Information on timing of intervention by indicated duration of antithrombotic therapy should be communicated with the patient
and treating general physician.

5.3.1. Antiplatelets
5.3.1.1. Single antiplatelet therapy
In patients taking aspirin for primary prevention, the risk of ischaemic
events is low and aspirin can be withdrawn prior to NCS. Permanent
discontinuation should be considered post-operatively in low- and
moderate-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk
patients and/or in patients with high bleeding risk based on
negative/neutral trials and the recommendations for primary preven
tion of CVD in the 2021 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular disease
prevention in clinical practice. [40][,][241]

Due to the better risk–benefit ratio, aspirin has an established role for
the long-term prevention of new cardiovascular events in patients with
established CVD. [242] ThePOISE-2 trial isthelargest, randomized,placebocontrolled trial of peri-operative aspirin in patients undergoing NCS. [243]

reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (,40%), poorly controlled diabetes, severely impaired renal function/haemodialysis, recent complex PCI (i.e.
severely calcified lesion, left main PCI, chronic total occlusion, bifurcational/crush technique, bypass graft PCI), or stent malapposition/residual dissection.
b Timing of resumption after interdisciplinary risk assessment as soon as possible (within 48 h) after surgery. c For dosing, see Figure 7.


The trial randomized 10 010 patients undergoing NCS with established CVD, or who were at increased CV risk, to aspirin or placebo.
Patients were stratified according to whether they had not been taking aspirin before the study or were already on aspirin; 33% of the
patients had known vascular disease (23% CAD, 9% PAD, and 5%
stroke). Aspirin did not reduce the rates of death or non-fatal MI
at 30 days (7.0% vs. 7.1% in the placebo group [HR, 0.99; 95% CI,
0.86–1.15; P = 0.92]). Major bleeding was more common in the aspirin group than in the placebo group (4.6% vs. 3.8% [HR, 1.23; 95%
CI, 1.01–1.49; P = 0.04]). The primary outcome results were similar,
irrespective of whether or not patients had been taking aspirin before the study, and were also similar in patients with and without

vascular disease.

In a post hoc analysis of 470 patients (,5%) who had undergone
previous PCI, aspirin use was associated with a significant reduction
in death or MI (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26–0.95; P = 0.036) and MI alone
(HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22–0.87; P = 0.021), while the risk of major or
life-threatening bleeding was not significantly increased in this setting. [244] Although the analysis carries several limitations, it supports


the perception that the ischaemic benefit of peri-operative aspirin
use outweighs the bleeding risk in patients with previous PCI.
Thus, among patients with previous PCI, in the absence of a very
high bleeding risk, low-dose aspirin should be continued during the
peri-operative period.
In patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation
(TAVI) who have no other indication for oral anticoagulant (OAC)
therapy, low-dose aspirin has been recommended as standard therapy by recent guidelines based on an RCT. [245][,][246] There are no randomized data available assessing the withdrawal vs. continuation of
aspirin in patients after TAVI on aspirin alone undergoing NCS.
If the bleeding risk outweighs the potential CV benefit, aspirin
should be discontinued. For patients with high peri-operative bleeding risk (e.g. undergoing spinal surgery or certain neurosurgical or
ophthalmological operations) aspirin should be discontinued for at
least 7 days.
On rare occasions, chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) patients
might be on clopidogrel monotherapy due to the results of recent
trials [247] and the recommendations of the 2020 ESC Guidelines for

3860 ESC Guidelines

the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting
without persistent ST-segment elevation; [98] therefore, periprocedural management of clopidogrel-based single antiplatelet therapy
(SAPT) is required. Consensus has been reached that a short interruption of P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy is recommended in patients
at high risk of bleeding.
Patients treated with P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy as part of a deescalation strategy after PCI/ACS, or due to a recent stroke, PAD, or
aspirin intolerance, might require peri-operative management of this
monotherapy. [248][–][250] A careful interdisciplinary evaluation of perioperative bleeding vs. ischaemic risk is warranted in these situations,
and individual decisions based on the peri-operative bleeding and ischaemic risk (e.g. surgery under P2Y 12 monotherapy, switching to aspirin, short interruption, or bridging in the peri-operative phase) may
be applicable, although evidence for these different regimens is


missing. It should be recognized that the effects of ticagrelor or clopidogrel monotherapy on haemostasis are considerably less than
when they are combined with aspirin.

5.3.1.2. Dual antiplatelet therapy
P2Y 12 inhibitors in addition to aspirin are recommended for patients
after PCI. [98][,][146] The frequency of major NCS in the first year after PCI
is ≏4%; most frequently orthopaedic, abdominal, and vascular surgery. [251] Other observational data report cumulative incidences of
NCS after PCI for 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year of 1%, 5%, and
9%, respectively. [252]

—
Observational studies have reported a substantial rate of MACE

—
including cardiac death, MI, and stent thrombosis ranging between
2–8% [251][,][253][,][254] in PCI patients undergoing NCS, with a more than
two-fold increased risk compared with non-stented patients. [255][,][256]

kg/min for a minimum of 48 h and a maximum of 7 days.


The proportion of risk attributable to underlying CVD or stent implantation remains uncertain. [254] Risk factors for MACE after NCS
are: time from PCI to surgery, with the highest risk in the first month;
primary PCI for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI);
dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) interruptions/discontinuation; and
lesion characteristics, including ostial and distal lesions. [252][,][257][–][259]

Urgency of surgery is a further risk factor. The ESC/ESA classification
of NCS is a validated tool with which to predict the impact of the
type of surgery on MACE. [16]

A meta-analysis of observational data indicated that discontinuation of clopidogrel for at least 5 days reduced the risk of reoperation for major bleeding by 50%, without increasing the risk
of MACE or death. [260] Other observational data indicate an increase
in MACE with brief DAPT interruptions. [261] However, these nonrandomized data may have been biased by the type and urgency of
surgery. [260] Of note, the prognosis of stent thrombosis appears to


be worse than for de novo coronary occlusion (and depends on
the site of stent deployment), and premature interruption of
DAPT in patients with recent coronary stent implantation is the
strongest predictor for stent thrombosis.
The preferred management of patients on DAPT due to PCI is to
delay elective NCS until completion of the full course of DAPT
(6 months after elective PCI and 12 months after ACS). [98][,][146]

However, several recent trials have indicated that shortening
DAPT duration to 1–3 months after implantation of modern DES
is associated with acceptable rates of MACE and stent thrombosis
in low- and moderate-risk patients. Based on these newer data, it
is recommended to delay time-sensitive NCS until a minimum of
1 month of DAPT treatment has been effectuated. In high-risk CV
patients, for example due to an ACS, a DAPT duration of at least

3 months should be considered before time-sensitive NCS.

See Figure 5 for the recommended duration of DAPT before

3862 ESC Guidelines


time-sensitive NCS. Once the P2Y 12 inhibitor has been discontinued,

surgery should be performed while the patient is still on aspirin.
Indications for long-term DAPT have recently emerged.
Long-term DAPT (beyond 1 year) with clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor in addition to aspirin should be considered in patients with
high ischaemic risk, and may be considered in patients with moderate
ischaemic risk, both in the absence of increased risk of major or lifethreatening bleeding. [98] When NCS is required, discontinuation of
P2Y 12 inhibitors is recommended for 3–7 days (depending on the
P2Y 12 inhibitor) for these additional indications for DAPT.

5.3.1.3. De-escalation of antiplatelet effect
The management of antiplatelet therapy in patients who have undergone recent PCI and are scheduled for NCS should be discussed by
the surgeon and cardiologist, so that the balance between the risk
of life-threatening surgical bleeding on antiplatelet therapy—best

—
understood by the surgeon and the risk of life-threatening stent
thrombosis due to premature DAPT discontinuation—best understood by the cardiologist—can be considered (Figure 5 and Figure 6).
An increased risk of MACE as a consequence of (major) bleeding
also needs to be taken into consideration when balancing risk.
When time-sensitive surgery cannot be postponed and be per
formed with the recommended DAPT on board, de-escalation or

shortening of DAPT is recommended. This may encompass either
a switch from the more potent P2Y 12 inhibitors prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel, or cessation of aspirin and use of prasugrel or ticagrelor monotherapy. If neither of these options is deemed to be
sufficient, premature discontinuation of the P2Y 12 inhibitor may
be considered. If discontinuation is required, ticagrelor needs to be
withheld for 3–5 days, clopidogrel for 5 days, and prasugrel for 7
days prior to surgery. [262][–][264]

Whenever possible, in patients with an indication for DAPT, surgery should be performed without discontinuation of aspirin. Aspirin
might be discontinued as a last measure only with very high bleeding
risk and a comparably low ischaemic risk. However, such surgical
procedures should be performed in hospitals where 24/7 catheterization laboratories are available so as to treat patients immediately
in case of peri-operative ischaemic events.
Although generally not recommended, bridging with i.v. compounds (eptifibatide/tirofiban or cangrelor) might be applicable in
rare cases when DAPT cannot be interrupted before NCS (e.g. in patients with very high risk of stent thrombosis, history of recurrent MI,
recent PCI) (see Figure 5 and Figure 7). [282]

For patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, who have excessive or
life-threatening peri-operative bleeding, transfusion of platelets is recommended as a bail-out strategy. However, ticagrelor and its active
metabolite may also inhibit aggregation of transfused platelets.
Experimental data indicate that administration of albumin binds ticagrelor and reduces its inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. [283] A
monoclonal antibody fragment (PB2452) for neutralizing ticagrelor is
in development but is not yet clinically available. [284]

5.3.1.4. Platelet function guided peri-operative management of
antiplatelet therapy
Platelet function testing has several theoretical advantages in the
peri-operative setting, including: (i) the identification of patients on
antiplatelet therapy who are at increased risk of surgery-related


bleeding; (ii) individualized timing of elective surgery after antiplatelet
therapy cessation; and (iii) guiding therapy in bleeding complications. [285][–][287] However, neither the optimal assay nor a universal cutoff value associated with bleeding has been defined and validated in
patients undergoing NCS.

5.3.2. Oral anticoagulants
Approximately one in four patients taking anticoagulant therapy will
require a surgical or invasive procedure within 2 years. [290]

Peri-operative management of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy depends on surgery- and patient-related factors and the specific OAC
agent (vitamin K antagonist [VKA] or a non-vitamin K antagonist oral
anticoagulant [NOAC]). See Figure 8 for a summary of recommendations for the management of OACs in patients undergoing NCS.
Surgery-related factors include urgency of the intervention and
the procedure-related bleeding risk (reflecting both the risk of bleeding occurrence and the risk of adverse outcome if bleeding occurs)
(see Table 8). Procedures where mechanical compression is unfeasible carry a high risk of serious bleeding complications.
Patient-related factors include age, individual thrombotic risk,
history of bleeding complications, renal function, concomitant

medication, comorbidity, etc. Patients requiring a reversal agent
need careful monitoring of haemostatic parameters and evaluation of thrombotic and bleeding risk in the peri-operative
phase, as reversal might be insufficient or prothrombotic rebound might occur. In the latter case, an interdisciplinary decision should be made with regard to early resumption of
anticoagulation treatment.

3864 ESC Guidelines


Minor surgical procedures and procedures where bleeding is easily
controlled can be performed without VKA interruption. The INR

should be monitored and maintained at the lower level of the thera
peutic range. Major surgical procedures needing INR ≤1.5 require
VKA interruption, and heparin bridging should be considered.
However, the evidence to support bridging therapy is limited and derived from cohort studies with poor or no comparator groups. [291]

Furthermore, the current-generation mechanical prosthetic valves
in the aortic position are associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism compared with the older ones. [291] Randomized controlled
trials of bridging vs. no bridging therapy for patients with AF who do
not have an MHV have shown higher risk of bleeding without a
change in incidence of thromboembolic events, and increasing concerns have been raised that bridging therapy exposes patients to
higher bleeding risks without reducing the risk of thromboembolism. [292][,][293] The recently published PERI-OP trial compared bridging
therapy vs. placebo in patients with either an MHV, AF, or atrial flutter who required interruption of OAC therapy for surgery, and
found no significant benefit for post-operative dalteparin bridging
to prevent major thromboembolism. [294] The results were consistent
for the AF (n = 1166) and MHVs groups (n = 350). Therefore, in patients with MHVs with a low risk of thromboembolism (e.g. mechanical bileaflet aortic valve in patients with sinus rhythm), bridging may
not be needed. In patients with MHVs with a high risk of thromboembolism (mechanical aortic valve replacement [AVR] and any
thromboembolic risk factor, or an older-generation mechanical
AVR, or a mechanical mitral or tricuspid valve replacement), bridging
with heparin should be considered during the peri-operative time
interval when the INR is subtherapeutic (Figure 8). In all situations,
the risks of bleeding should be weighed against the benefits of
thromboembolism prevention.
Intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) is the only heparin treatment approved for bridging in patients with MHVs. Subcutaneous low
molecular weight heparin (LMWH), although used off-label, has supplanted the use of UFH as a bridging therapy, owing to the lower incidence of thrombocytopenia, greater convenience, more predictable
dose–response relationship, and significant cost saving resulting from
outpatient administration. A meta-analysis of nine studies of 1042 pa
tients with MHVs showed no differences between LMWH and UFH in
the risks of thromboembolic events or major bleeding events. [295]

When LMWH is used, it should be given at a therapeutic dose twice
a day and adjusted for renal impairment, when applicable. Anti-factor

–
Xa (FXa) activity monitoring with target levels from 0.5 1.0 U/mL may
be useful when the dosage may be difficult to determine (e.g. in patients with renal dysfunction or obesity). Vitamin K antagonist bridging
[strategies are shown in Supplementary data, Figure S2.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data)

5.3.2.1.2. Vitamin K antagonists for atrial fibrillation/venous
thromboembolism. In patients using VKA for AF or venous
thromboembolism (VTE), invasive procedures with a low bleeding
risk can be performed without VKA interruption. [296][–][299] The INR

should be monitored and maintained at the lower level of the thera
peutic range. When interruption is necessary due to high bleeding
risk procedures, the BRIDGE trial in AF patients showed that 3–5
days of warfarin interruption without bridging was superior to heparin
bridging, having the same incidence of arterial and venous thromboembolism and significantly lower incidence of major bleeding. [292]


Bridging therapy may be considered for patients with a high
thrombotic risk (i.e. AF with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke, vascular
disease, age 65–74 years, sex category [female]) score .6, recent
cardioembolic stroke,3 months, or high risk of VTE recurrence,
weighing the risk of bleeding against the risk of thromboembolism [291][,][294][,][300] [(see Supplementary data, Figure S3).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data)

5.3.2.1.3. Restarting vitamin K antagonists after invasive procedures or surgery. Patients who have interrupted VKA treatment before surgery should restart the OAC 12–24 h after the invasive
procedure, if the bleeding is well-controlled and gastric and intestinal
reabsorption have been re-established. The restarting dose should
be the maintenance dose plus a boosting dose of 50% for 2 days.
Patients managed with bridging therapy should start LMWH or
UFH together with VKA 24 h after surgery, if the bleeding is wellcontrolled and maintained, until the INR has reached the therapeutic
range. In patients undergoing surgery with a high bleeding risk, therapeutic dose LMWH should be delayed for 48–72 h after haemostasis

has been secured.

5.3.2.1.4. Reversal of vitamin K antagonists. Reversal of VKA can
be managed with vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrates

–
(PPCs), and plasma administration. Vitamin K (from 2 10 mg depending on the INR value) can be used orally, with a predictable
reduction in INR in 18–24 h or i.v. (in 25–50 mL normal saline
over 15–30 min) for more rapid INR reduction (4–6 h). It should
be noted that coagulation factors can still be below normal despite
INR normalization, which means that bleeding risk might not yet
be normalized. In patients needing reversal for immediate major surgery, PPCs or plasma should be used. Four-factor PPCs are the preferred option [301] and are dosed on the basis of INR and body weight
(INR 2–4 at 25 U/kg, INR 4–6 at 35 U/kg, INR .6 at 50 U/kg, with a
maximum dose of 5000 U at 100 kg of body weight). When fourfactor PPCs are unavailable, three-factor PPCs or plasma may be
used. Patients requiring a reversal agent need careful monitoring of
haemostatic parameters and evaluation of thrombotic and bleeding
risks in the peri-operative phase, as reversal might be insufficient
or a prothrombotic rebound might occur. In the latter case, an interdisciplinary decision should be made with regard to early resumption
of anticoagulation treatment.

5.3.2.2. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants
Four drugs are currently used: dabigatran (factor IIa inhibitor), apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban (FXa inhibitors). The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of these drugs are shown

in Table 8.

5.3.2.2.1. Unplanned surgery in patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and reversal for emergency procedures.
When an urgent surgical intervention is required, it is recommended
that NOAC therapy is immediately interrupted. Peri-operative management of NOAC therapy in specific procedural settings and suggested strategies for potential reversal of NOAC anticoagulant
effect are shown in Figures 9–11 [99][,][240][,][302] [(see Supplementary data,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data)

NCS, non-cardiac surgery; NOAC, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant. [a] In patients/circumstances favouring NOAC accumulation (e.g. renal dysfunction, older age, concomitant medication), the NOAC should be paused 12–24 h earlier. [b] In patients on rivaroxaban or edoxaban taking the dose in the evening, the evening dose may be
skipped. [c] NOACs have predictable weaning of the anticoagulant effect. Owing to the increase in bleeding risk associated with bridging, it is generally not recommended to use bridging in patients taking NOACs. Very few circumstances when bridging with heparin may be considered in patients taking a NOAC
include high thromboembolic risk conditions, such as: 1) patients with a recent (within 3 months) thromboembolic event (stroke, systemic embolism, or
VTE); 2) patients who experienced a thromboembolic event during previous interruption of NOAC therapy.


Whereas the open-label prospective trial testing the specific reversal agent idarucizumab in patients on dabigatran enrolled participants experiencing acute major bleeding or requiring urgent surgical
intervention, [303] the trial with the reversal agent andexanet alpha for
FXa inhibitors included only patients with acute major bleeding under therapy, but not those requiring urgent surgery. [304] However,
the off-label use of andexanet alpha in life-threatening situations requiring an immediate intervention may be considered, bearing in
mind that andexanet alpha non-specifically binds all FXa inhibitors,
which may have important implications for further treatment, including the administration of UFH or LMWH. [240] When specific reversal


agents are unavailable, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or
activated PCC should be considered, although there is a lack of evidence on their efficacy and safety for emergency procedures in patients taking a NOAC. [290][,][305] Performing immediate or urgent
surgery under general rather than spinal anaesthesia is prudent, in order to reduce the risk of epidural haematoma.
Prior to unplanned surgery, the full panel of coagulation blood
[tests (see Supplementary data, Table S6) should be obtained in order](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data)
to assess the patient’s coagulation status. The indication for reversal
(and/or non-specific haemostatic) agents is primarily governed by the
patient’s clinical presentation, but initial assessment of coagulation

status may have important implications for treatment in the next few
hours or days. Specific coagulation tests such as diluted thrombin
time (dTT) or ecarin clotting assay for dabigatran and antiFXa
chromogenic assays for FXa inhibitors, and the assessment of
NOAC plasma levels, may help in interpreting routine coagulation
tests and waning of anticoagulant effect. [240]

5.3.2.2.2. Planned interventions in patients on non-vitamin K oral
anticoagulants. Invasive surgical interventions may require temporary discontinuation of NOAC therapy, while many less-invasive procedures with a relatively low risk of bleeding may be performed under
minimally interrupted or uninterrupted NOAC therapy (Figure 9). [240]

5.3.2.2.3. Bridging. In patients taking a NOAC, peri-operative bridging using heparin or LMWH was associated with increased risk of
bleeding without reduction in thromboembolic events. [290][,][306][–][308]

Therefore, when NOAC interruption is required for surgery, bridging


is not recommended, except in a few high thrombotic risk circumstances (see Figure 9). However, post-operative thromboprophylaxis
with LMWH should be considered in patients in whom NOAC therapy cannot be quickly restarted. In patients receiving bridging with
LMWH, monitoring of antiFXa activity and dose adjustment to a tar
–
get level of 0.5 1.0 U/mL may be considered.

5.3.2.2.4. Laboratory testing before surgery. Pre-operative assessment of anticoagulation status in patients on a NOAC undergoing
planned surgery provides a direct assessment of residual drug concentration. Shorter NOAC interruption time intervals in patients
undergoing low-risk procedures may result in mildly or moderately
elevated NOAC levels, as seen in the Perioperative Anticoagulant
Use for Surgery Evaluation (PAUSE) trial, [309] whereas creatinine clearance,50 mL/min, standard NOAC dose (compared with reduced
dose), body weight,70 kg, and female sex were associated with elevated NOAC levels among patients undergoing high-risk surgery.

undergoing urgent surgery. Andexanet has not been tested in patients requiring urgent surgery. Andexanet binds all FXa inhibitors (including UFH) nonspecifically. [e] Upon re-check.


The use of amiodarone, verapamil, or diltiazem was also associated with
elevated pre-operative NOAC levels in the prospective Per-procedural
Concentration of Direct Oral Anticoagulants (CORIDA) trial. [310]

Importantly, elevated NOAC levels were not found to be independently associated with bleeding complications. [309][,][310]

The evidence base for modifying the duration of pre-operative
NOAC interruption time intervals according to residual NOAC plasma levels is unavailable, and ‘safe’ plasma levels of NOACs for different procedures are largely unknown. The time-based NOAC
interruption (Figure 9) appears safe in most patients undergoing surgery. [311][,][312] When NOACs are interrupted for .72 h, the likelihood
of any residual NOAC plasma levels is very low. [309][,][310]


5.3.2.2.5. Considerations for specific procedures. Before interven
—
tions that carry a very high risk of bleeding such as spinal or epidural

–
anaesthesia, or lumbar puncture requiring intact haemostasis- interruption of NOACs for up to five half-lives (i.e. 3 days for FXa inhibitors or
4–5 days for dabigatran) should be considered, whereas NOACs can
usually be restarted 24 h after the intervention. [313][,][314]

Dental procedures are generally considered to be associated with
minor bleeding risk, and adequate local haemostasis is usually easily
achieved. Hence, most dental procedures can be performed in an
outpatient setting, with uninterrupted NOAC (or a single skipped
dose) and using specific local haemostatic measures (such as the application of oxidized cellulose or absorbable gelatine sponge, sutures,

3868 ESC Guidelines


tranexamic acid mouthwash or compressive gauze). Most professional statements on dental surgery advise uninterrupted NOAC,
but these recommendations are mostly based on expert consensus,
while some studies are currently ongoing. [315][–][317]

5.3.2.2.6. When to restart non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants after interventions. In general, NOAC can be restarted
6–8 h after interventions with rapid and complete haemostasis.
When the bleeding risk with full-dose anticoagulation resumption
outweighs the risk of thromboembolic events, therapeutic anticoagulation may be postponed to .48–72 h after the procedure,
using prophylactic post-operative thromboprophylaxis until the
resumption of full-dose NOAC is deemed safe (Figure 9). [240]

Post-operative heparin administration should also be considered in patients unable to take oral therapy. Off-label use of reduced-dose
NOACs to attenuate the risk of post-operative bleeding is not recommended, as there is no evidence informing such an approach.

5.3.2.3. Combination therapy (antiplatelet and anticoagulant)
In general, according to the 2020 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis
and management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration
with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery
(EACTS), dual antithrombotic therapy should be adopted in most
patients with AF and a recent PCI. [99] Elective surgery should be postponed until the period when antiplatelet therapy can be safely discontinued in combination therapy (6 months after elective PCI or
12 months after ACS). [268] Peri-operative handling of NOACs should
follow the above recommendations (Figures 9 and 10). In urgent/
emergency surgery with high bleeding risk, operative measures to reduce bleeding and/or reversal strategies of anticoagulation might be
applied. In patients receiving combination therapy for other indications (e.g. TAVI and AF), according to recent trial results, antiplatelet
therapy can be safely discontinued before NCS. [318] In patients receiving low-dose OACs as part of a vascular protection strategy, rivaroxaban should be paused for at least 24 h before surgery and resumed
according to the post-operative bleeding risk.

5.4. Peri-operative thromboprophylaxis
Trends show that the case-fatality of peri-operative VTE has declined
over the past few decades. [319][,][320] Its causal relationship with preventable mortality has been challenged by a recent meta-analysis. [321]

Thus, peri-operative VTE should be regarded as a marker of increased mortality risk rather than a causal factor. Careful preoperative assessment is essential to identify patients with increased
VTE risk who might benefit from peri-operative thromboprophylaxis. Procedure-related (e.g. type of surgery and likelihood of postoperative immobilization) and patient-related factors contribute to
the risk of VTE. For non-orthopaedic surgical patients at low risk
of VTE, mechanical methods of VTE prophylaxis (graduated compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression, or venous
foot pump) rather than pharmacologic prophylaxis or no prophylaxis
are recommended. Patients with CV disease (e.g. patients with recent MI or HF) have increased risk of peri-operative VTE. [322] The
Caprini score has been developed for risk stratification, [323] and vali[dated in different surgical settings (see Supplementary data,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data)
[Table S7).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data) [324][–][327]

Thromboprophylaxis should be considered for patients with
moderate (i.e. 5–8 points) and high scores (i.e. ≥9 points).
Thromboprophylaxis should be initiated during the hospital stay until
12 h before NCS and continued post-operatively based on individual
risk assessment for bleeding. In most cases, thromboprophylaxis
should be continued until the patient becomes fully mobilized or until
hospital discharge (usually up to 10 days). Extended pharmacological
VTE prophylaxis beyond discharge is not routinely recommended in

                                         most non-orthopaedic surgical patients. Although there are insuffi
cient data regarding thromboprophylaxis after cancer surgery (particularly major abdominal and/or pelvic surgery for cancer), the
consensus is to extend treatment duration with preferred use of
LMWH for 3–4 weeks. Decisions on prophylaxis in populations
for which the Caprini score has not been validated (such as orthopaedic surgery) should be based on individual and procedure-specific
risk factors. Among those, a previous VTE is the strongest risk pre[dictor (see Supplementary data, Table S7).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac270#supplementary-data) [328] For special situations
and populations (e.g. neurosurgery, elderly, obese), please refer to
available specific practice guidelines. [329][–][332]

Large phase 3 and phase 4 studies comparing NOACs with
LMWH have shown similar results regarding efficacy and safety after
major orthopaedic surgery. [333] The usual time period for thromboprophylaxis after total knee and hip arthroplasty was up to 14 days
and 35 days in RCTs, respectively, [334][–][339] but large-scale data suggest
safety of foreshortening the duration restricted to the hospital stay
after fast-track surgery. [340] Recent practice guidelines and a
meta-analysis suggest a rationale for the use of aspirin as thromboprophylaxis in modern elective total hip and knee arthroplasty. [341][,][342]

However, there is a need for more adequately powered clinical trials
with appropriate end-points comparing aspirin with other pharmacological methods. Aspirin should not be used as the sole initial agent
for VTE prophylaxis, but switching to aspirin following a short course
(e.g. 5 days) of rivaroxaban may be suitable for selected low-risk patients. [343] It is recommended to implement patient care programmes

—
including post-operative mobilization, electronic prophylaxis recommendations, and teaching sessions regarding daily use of thromboprophylaxis—as these have been shown to be beneficial in
reducing the risk of post-operative VTE complications. [344]

5.5. Patient blood management
Major surgery is associated with a high risk of peri-operative blood
loss. Preferred treatment of acute anaemia related to peri-operative
blood loss is transfusion of allogenic blood products. However, a
large body of evidence indicates that inappropriate transfusion of
red blood cells (RBCs) may be associated with inherent complications and impaired surgical outcome. Therefore, it is important to
identify at-risk patients pre-operatively and manage peri-operative
bleeding in any patients undergoing major surgery.
A hallmark study including .200 000 major surgical patients
showed that even mild anaemia significantly increased the risk of

—
morbidity including respiratory, urinary, wound, septic, and

—
thromboembolic complications and mortality across all age
groups. [345] Moreover, Baron and colleagues analysed .39 000 surgical patients and showed that anaemia was significantly associated
with increased mortality rate, hospital length of stay, and postoperative admission to intensive care. [346] Up to 48% of surgical
patients suffer from anaemia, and therefore anaemia should be considered to be a risk factor any time during hospitalization. [347] Von
Heymann and colleagues analysed 4494 cardiac surgical patients
and showed that pre-operative anaemia and intra-operative transfusion were independently associated with decreased long-term
survival. [348] In addition, long-term survival was decreased by 50% in
anaemic patients receiving blood transfusion compared with those

without blood transfusion.

Anaemia may contribute to myocardial ischaemia, particularly if
CAD is present. Iron deficiency (ID) is the underlying cause of anaemia in ≏50% of all cases. [347] It was recently shown that ID was associated with increased risk of 90 day mortality both in patients with

– –
(4 14%) and without (2 5%) anaemia. [349] In addition, the incidence

3870 ESC Guidelines


of serious adverse events, major cardiac and cerebrovascular events,
allogenic blood transfusion requirements, and length of stay were increased in patients with ID.
Based on the possibility of preserving the patients’ own blood
resources and to enable safe handling of donor blood, the
World Health Assembly (WHA) has endorsed the Patient
Blood Management (PBM) approach (WHA63.12). Patient Blood
Management is a patient-centred and multidisciplinary approach to
manage anaemia, minimize iatrogenic blood loss and bleeding, and
harness tolerance to anaemia in an effort to improve patient outcome. [350][–][355] A comprehensive PBM programme addressing all three
PBM pillars was associated with reduced transfusion need of RBC
units, and lower complication and mortality rates. [350]

5.5.1. Pre-operative anaemia diagnosis and

treatment

A serum ferritin level,30 ng/mL, transferrin saturation,20%, and/
or microcytic hypochromic red cells (mean corpuscular volume
,80 fl, mean corpuscular haemoglobin,27 g/dL) are indicative of
ID. In the presence of inflammation or transferrin saturation
,20%, a ferritin level of,100 ng/mL points to functional ID (iron
sequestration) (Table 10).
Apart from compromised bone marrow function, most types of
anaemia are correctable within a period of 2–4 weeks. Oral and
i.v. iron therapy can be used to treat ID. Intravenous iron products
consist of an iron core embedded in a carbohydrate shell, which influences the stability of the drug, for example: iron sucrose comprises a less stable shell, allowing a maximum dose of 200 mg per
infusion, whereas ferric carboxymaltose, ferric derisomaltose, and
ferumoxytol have a stable shell associated with slow iron release
and allowing a higher dose. Administration of i.v. iron has been
shown to effectively reverse anaemia in ID patients. [356][,][357]

Intravenous iron is efficacious and safe [359] and should be used in
patients in whom oral iron is not tolerated, or if surgery is planned
in short notice after the diagnosis of ID. A prospective observational
study of 1728 major surgical patients showed that the prevalence of
ID was 50%, 46.3%, and 52.7% in patients with haemoglobin,8.0,
8.0–8.9, and 9.0–9.9 g/dL, respectively. [357] Furthermore, all iron supplemented iron-deficient anaemic patients required fewer RBC
transfusions during the post-operative period, and a reduced
intra-operative transfusion rate was observed if iron was supplemented .7 days before surgery. In addition, the length of stay was

significantly reduced by 2.8 days for iron supplemented patients. In
the recent PREVENTT trial studying patients with anaemia undergoing major abdominal surgery, pre-operative iron transfusion failed to
improve outcomes; [360] however, due to a fault in the study design, all
anaemic patients received i.v. iron but not all (≏50–70%) were suffering from ID.
Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has frequently
been used together with iron supplementation to increase preoperative haemoglobin concentrations. A recent Cochrane review
found that the administration of rHuEPO + iron to anaemic patients
prior to NCS, compared with control treatment, reduced the need
for RBC transfusion and increased the haemoglobin concentration
pre-operatively; however, there were no important differences in
the risk of adverse events or mortality within 30 days, or in length
of hospital stay. [361] Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are required to more precisely estimate the impact of this combined

treatment.

Pre-operative management of patients with anaemia can be simplified by making use of standard operating procedures or algorithms in
which thresholds for diagnosis and treatment are depicted. [362] An example of such an algorithm can be found in the PBM programme [363]

5.5.2. Bleeding and reduction of iatrogenic
diagnostic/surgery-related blood loss
Blood loss associated with laboratory testing can either cause or aggravate hospital-acquired anaemia, which is associated with increased length of stay and complications. In 1867 patients
undergoing cardiac surgery, an average of 115 tests per patient
were performed, with a cumulative median volume of 454 mL. [365]

A reduction in blood drawn for laboratory analyses can be achieved
by lowering the frequency of sampling and using paediatric-size collection tube sizes, for example. To decrease blood loss, blood-saving
bundles could be used (e.g. a closed-loop arterial blood sampling system, smaller sampling tubes, reduction of frequency of blood

drawings, and sample numbers). Such a strategy decreased mean
blood loss per intensive care unit (ICU) day from 43.3 mL to
15.0 mL (P, 0.001), [366] mainly due to the introduction of
closed-loop arterial blood sampling systems. In addition, units of
transfused RBCs per 100 observation days decreased from 7 to
2.3 (P, 0.001). [366]

A reduction in surgery-related blood loss starts from the preoperative stage, with appropriate cessation strategies for anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. Intra-operative approaches to avoid
blood loss include: (i) advanced anaesthetic; (ii) advanced surgical
techniques with meticulous haemostasis, such as minimally invasive
surgery and laparoscopic surgery; (iii) judicious use of diathermy dissection; (iv) physician’s mindfulness regarding limiting blood loss; and
(v) application of topical haemostatic agents. [367][–][369]

Adequate coagulation management to minimize blood loss needs
to be a pre-condition before RBC transfusion is considered. In this
respect, the use of a coagulation algorithm is recommended, [370][,][371]

encompassing pre-operative assessment, [372] and ensuring basic conditions for haemostasis, reversal of anticoagulants, point-of-care
diagnostics in bleeding patients, and optimized coagulation management with the use of clotting factor concentrates. [373][,][374]

Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that is widely used for
prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding caused by hyperfibrinolysis. A
meta-analysis including 129 trials encompassing more than 10 000
patients to assess the effect of tranexamic acid on blood transfusion
showed that administration of tranexamic acid reduced allogeneic
blood transfusion by 38% (P, 0.001). [375] In the recent POISE-3
study, 9535 patients undergoing NCS were randomized to tranexamic acid (1 g i.v. bolus) or placebo at the start and end of surgery.
The incidence of the primary efficacy outcome (composite bleeding
outcome) at 30 days was significantly lower with tranexamic acid

–
than with placebo (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67 0.87). [376] With respect
to the primary safety outcome (composite CV outcome), the results
did not meet the non-inferiority criteria (HR, 1.02; 95% CI,
0.92–1.14; P = 0.04 for non-inferiority).
The use of (washed) cell recovery is highly recommended in surgical settings where blood loss is routinely or anticipated to be
.500 mL, as it reduces the rate of exposure to allogeneic RBCs,
risk of infection, and length of stay. A meta-analysis including 47 trials
encompassing 3433 patients of all surgical disciplines showed that the
use of washed cell salvage reduced the rate of exposure to allogeneic
RBC transfusion by 39% (P, 0.001), risk of infection by 28% (P =
0.03), and length of stay by 2.31 days (P, 0.001). [377]

5.5.3. Optimal blood component use with
patient-centred clinical decision support
In order to optimize utilization of allogeneic blood products and to
ensure guideline-adherent transfusion strategies, computerized
physician order-entry systems should be considered. [390][,][391] For example, Kaserer and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of a monitoring and feedback programme and compared transfusion rates of
.210 000 patients before and after implementation; [392] overall,
transfusion of RBCs was reduced by 40%.
Informed consent should be obtained from patients prior to transfusion of allogeneic blood products. It is necessary to effectively communicate the risks and benefits of the various potential interventions
to the patient. It may further be recommended that any transfusion
of allogeneic blood products should be mentioned in the discharge
summary. In addition, the patient’s own preferences and values
should be considered when developing a medical plan.

Patients with CVD have an increased risk of peri-operative CV complications. [45] Both the risk of complications and the peri-operative
management depend on the specific type of CVD.

degree of urgency of the NCS. Older patients have a higher risk than
younger patients, and patients with a recent ACS have a higher risk
than those with CCS. The presence of comorbidities may also influ
ence the risk.

6.1.2. Pre-operative risk assessment and
management
The diagnostic evaluation and pre-operative management of patients
with CCS undergoing NCS are outlined in Section 4. In particular, the

value of CCTA and ICA are discussed in Sections 4.5.3.1. and 4.5.3.2.

In patients in need of immediate NCS, the operation must be performed without further delay and the time for pre-operative assess
ment is limited.

In patients scheduled for elective NCS who present with an ACS,
the management of ACS should follow the guidelines for ACS patients in the non-surgical setting. [98][,][171] In such settings, it would be
reasonable to consider treating the culprit lesion only before NCS.
Potential changes in timing of surgery and the peri-operative management (e.g. type of surgery, anaesthesia, medical therapy, and perioperative monitoring) should be considered.
In patients with known CAD, it is recommended to collect information regarding previous invasive and non-invasive diagnostic examinations, and therapeutic interventions for CAD, within a
sufficient time interval before the NCS, ideally at the time the proposal for NCS is made.

6.1.3. Revascularization strategies
The indication for coronary revascularization depends on the clinical
presentation of CAD (ACS vs. CCS), urgency, and cardiac risk of
NCS. In general, there is clear evidence that routine revascularization
improves outcomes in ACS patients and less support for such a strategy in patients with CCS. The process of decision-making related to
revascularization in CCS should be individualized, in order to prioritize revascularization in case of involvement of a significant amount of
ischaemic myocardium or refractory symptoms, while medical management is a valuable option in patients with less relevant CAD

manifestations.

6.1.3.1. Chronic coronary syndromes
The rationale for coronary revascularization before NCS is to prevent peri-operative myocardial ischaemia leading to acute MI,
haemodynamic instability, and arrhythmia. Data from autopsy studies
following fatal peri-operative MI showed that more than two-thirds
of the patients had significant left main or three-vessel disease. [397] A
retrospective registry based on the Coronary Artery Surgery Study
(CASS) study found that coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) reduced the risk of peri-operative mortality and MI in patients undergoing major NCS, particularly in subjects with three-vessel disease
and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). [398] However,
the evidence in support of routine prophylactic revascularization before NCS is based on relatively small clinical trials and retrospective
registries unrepresentative of current clinical practice.
In the Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis (CARP)
trial, 510 patients with CCS were randomized to either optimal medical therapy or coronary revascularization (surgical or percutaneous)
before major vascular surgery. [399] In this study, patients receiving coronary revascularization compared with those who were medically


treated did not differ in terms of acute MI after 30 days (8.4% vs.
8.4%, respectively) and mortality after 2.7 years (22% vs. 23%, respectively). Of note, this study excluded patients with significant
left main disease, while one-third of the patients presented with
three-vessel disease. [399] In another randomized trial, 426 patients

without evidence of CAD and scheduled for CEA were randomized

to either routine coronary angiography with provisional revascularization before CEA or CEA without previous coronary angiography.
There were no significant differences between the treatment groups
in all-cause mortality, acute MI, and stroke at 30 days. [172] A subsequent meta-analysis including 3949 patients showed no clinical benefit associated with routine prophylactic revascularization before
NCS. [400] A recent retrospective analysis on 4414 patients undergoing
total joint arthroplasty found that the risk of adverse CV events was
increased in patients with CAD, regardless of coronary revascularization before surgery. However, in patients receiving coronary re
vascularization, the risk of adverse CV events decreased, as the

interval between revascularization and total joint arthroplasty was
.2 years. [401]

The lack of evidence in support of routine prophylactic revascularization in CCS does not preclude a decision-process based on
individual risk–benefit assessment in patients with a significant
amount of ischaemic myocardium (as in the case of left main
disease) and/or with refractory symptoms. The International Study
of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive
Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial randomized 5179 patients with stable
CAD and moderate or severe ischaemia to an initial invasive strategy
(consisting of angiography plus revascularization, as appropriate) or
to an initial strategy of medical therapy alone, with bail-out angiography if medical therapy failed. [402] This trial did not find a significant
difference in the primary composite end-point of death and MI between treatment groups. Interestingly, these neutral results were inapplicable to patients with severe left main disease, since these
patients were excluded after a pre-randomization CCTA. It has
yet to be demonstrated whether CCTA represents a valuable tool
with which to select patients with stable CAD and/or moderate
or severe ischaemia who might benefit from an initial invasive
strategy. A large angiography-based registry of 9016 CCS patients
with high-risk coronary anatomy (three-vessel disease with ≥70%
stenosis in all three epicardial vessels or left main disease ≥50%
stenosis) showed improved outcomes (all-cause mortality or MI) in
patients undergoing revascularization (both for PCI or CABG)
vs. conservative medical therapy (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.58–0.66; P,
0.001). [403]

The 2018 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization and the 2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndromes generally apply to this
population of patients, as long as the NCS can be postponed
long enough to allow safe discontinuation of DAPT. [146][,][404]

Similarly, the choice between PCI and CABG should follow the
general rules outlined in the above-mentioned guidelines. [268][,][404]

The use of intravascular imaging for planning and optimization of
PCI is encouraged. [405][,][406]

There are no trials specifically addressing the strategy of revascularization in ACS patients scheduled for NCS. High- and very high-risk

patients should be treated according to the 2020 ESC Guidelines for
the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting
without persistent ST-segment elevation, [98] with an early (,24 h) or
immediate (,2 h) invasive strategy, respectively. In low-risk groups


amenable to a selective invasive strategy, the decision-making should
be consistent with the approach for CCS patients.

with increased baseline troponin before randomization showed
lower risk of mortality with accelerated surgery (within 6 h
from the diagnosis) vs. standard of care (HR, 0.38; 95% CI,
0.21–0.66). [57]

The selection of the type of revascularization (PCI or CABG)
should be based on the coronary anatomy and complexity of atherosclerosis, and the presence of diabetes. [268][,][404] When PCI is chosen, the use of a DES is recommended. [407] In case of a

life-threatening clinical condition requiring undeferrable NCS and
concomitant ACS-STEMI with an indication for coronary revascularization, a minimalistic approach with plain balloon angioplasty
and delayed stenting might be considered. [408][,][409] Figure 12 shows
a summary of diagnostic and therapeutic pathways in patients

with CAD scheduled for NCS.

6.2. Chronic heart failure

6.2.1. Risk for patients with heart failure
Heart failure is an established risk factor for post-operative mortality
across a broad range of surgical specialties. [410][–][412] Several tools for
risk calculations in patients undergoing NCS include HF as a predictor of adverse post-operative events. [411][,][413]

The risk of adverse post-operative events associated with HF depends on whether the LV systolic function is preserved or reduced,
on the haemodynamic compensation, and on the presence of symptoms. [414][,][415] In patients undergoing NCS, there is a risk of acute decompensated HF, with rapid onset or worsening of symptoms and/
or signs of HF, precipitated by fluid accumulation and/or comorbid
conditions. [412]

Patients with peri-operative acute or chronic HF are at increased
risk of mortality during NCS. In a recently published analysis of 21
560 996 hospitalizations for NCS, the presence of any diagnosis of
HF was associated with significantly higher in-hospital all-cause mortality compared with absence of HF (4.8% vs. 0.78%; adjusted OR,

–
2.15; 95% CI, 2.09 2.22). [416] Among patients with a chronic HF diagnosis, peri-operative mortality was greater in those with acute exacerbation of chronic HF compared to those with compensated
chronic HF. In a recent large-scale cohort study of individuals undergoing ambulatory surgery, the crude 90 day mortality was 2.0%
among patients with HF and 0.4% among patients without HF. [417]

The crude risk of 30 day post-operative complications was 5.7%
and 2.7%, respectively. Of note, the risk of mortality progressively increased with decreasing systolic function. It is not recommended to
perform elective NCS in patients with decompensated HF.
The value of pre-operative assessment of LV function with
TTE and measurement of natriuretic peptides (BNP or
NT-proBNP) is discussed in Section 4.4. The TTE should not be older
than 6 months, or performed just before NCS in the case of clinical

worsening.

6.2.2. Pre- and post-operative management
strategies
In order to reduce the risk of acute decompensation and the risk of
mortality, optimal guideline-directed medical treatment of HF before
scheduled NCS is recommended. [412] Special attention should be given to the fluid balance, since high-volume infusion is often needed
in the peri-operative period. Invasive monitoring of the arterial
pressure aiming to obtain oximetric and metabolic parameters
during NCS is frequently needed for intermediate- to high-risk
NCS among HF patients. Furthermore, dynamic variables derived
from the arterial pressure waveform (cardiac output, pulse
pressure variation, stroke volume variation) are useful for guiding
protocolled goal-directed therapy. Use of more invasive tools,
such as right heart catheterization or transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), might be considered on an individual patient level (see
Section 7.1).
Baseline medication should be continued throughout the perioperative period, in accordance with the recommendations provided in Section 5.2. It is recommended to perform ECG, measure
biomarkers of myocardial injury (cTn T/I), and perform echocardiography to tailor the optimal treatment strategy in patients with acute
decompensated HF post-operatively.

The management of patients with cardiac implantable electronic
devices (CIEDs) undergoing NCS is discussed in Section 6.4.5.
In patients with resynchronization devices (cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]), it is recommended to keep the device on to
provide better haemodynamic stability.

6.2.3. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with LV outflow tract
obstruction (HOCM) have an increased risk of complications during NCS and require additional attention. [418] It is recommended to
perform TTE before NCS in order to determine the extent of the
hypertrophy, obstruction, and diastolic function. [419] Avoidance of
prolonged pre-operative fasting and dehydration is important to

maintain stroke volume and reduce the risk of increased obstruc
tion. Furthermore, it is important to avoid vasodilating anaesthetic
agents and maintain neutral fluid balance during the peri-operative

–
period. The heart rate should be kept low (60 65 beats per
minute [b.p.m.]) and AF should be avoided. Medication used
to treat LV outflow tract obstruction should remain on board
during NCS.

6.2.4. Patients with ventricular assist devices

undergoing non-cardiac surgery
Ventricular assist devices (VADs) play an important role in the treatment of patients with end-stage HF who require a bridge to heart
transplantation or as a permanent destination therapy. As the number of patients receiving VAD as destination therapy increases, [420][,][421]

the need for NCS in this specific subset of patients is expected to increase in years to come. Non-cardiac surgery should be performed
in surgical centres that have access to VAD teams (Table 11).

variable and depends on the severity of VHD and type of NCS.
It is particularly increased in patients with obstructive valve
pathology, for example symptomatic AS or MS, where perioperative volume shifts and arrhythmia may lead to rapid
decompensation. [424]

6.3.2. Pre-operative management strategies and
risk-reduction strategy
Clinical and echocardiographic evaluation is recommended in all patients with known or suspected VHD who are scheduled for elective
intermediate-or-high-risk NCS. Patients in whom mild-to-moderate
VHD was diagnosed .1 year earlier should have clinical and echocardiographic re-assessment. Heart team discussion may be helpful
in patients with significant VHD. The risks of valvular intervention


and the risk of NCS-related complications should be estimated
and communicated to the patient and the surgical team.

6.3.2.1. Aortic valve stenosis

The peri-operative risk associated with AS during NCS depends
upon the presence of symptoms, stenosis severity, and coexisting
cardiac disease (e.g. CAD, mitral insufficiency, or reduced LVEF).
Severe symptomatic AS is a significant risk factor for post-operative
MI and HF, and a predictor for 30 day and long-term mortality after
NCS. [425][,][426] Careful peri-operative management is essential in pa
                                         tients undergoing intermediate- and high-risk NCS, albeit the signifi
cance of AS in patients undergoing low-risk NCS might have been
overemphasized in studies that pre-date the more recent advances
in anaesthesia, surgical techniques, and post-operative management.

Aortic valve replacement has been associated with reduced in-hospital
and 30 day mortality and morbidity among patients with AS undergoing intermediate- to high-risk NCS. [425][,][426] However, the decision regarding the timing of AVR in relation to NCS should be weighted
according to the baseline risk profile and the risk associated with the
NCS. The choice of surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) vs.
TAVI should follow the 2021 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [245] and patient’s informed preference
(Figure 13).
In patients with severe symptomatic AS, in whom NCS can be deferred, aortic valve intervention (SAVR or TAVI) is recommended
before NCS. In patients requiring time-sensitive NCS, TAVI is a reasonable option. [427] In patients with severe symptomatic AS in need of

time-sensitive NCS in whom TAVI or SAVR are unfeasible, balloon

aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) may be considered before NCS as a bridge
to definitive aortic valve repair. Asymptomatic patients with severe


AS and normal LVEF can safely undergo low- to intermediate-risk
NCS, unless the NCS is associated with large volume shifts. [245][,][428]

6.3.2.2. Mitral valve stenosis

Non-cardiac surgery can be performed with a relatively low risk of
complications in patients with mild MS (valve area .1.5 cm [2] ) and
in asymptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe MS (valve area
≤1.5 cm [2] ) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP)
,50 mmHg on echocardiography. [429] As transmitral gradients are
flow-sensitive, tachycardia and fluid overload can cause pulmonary
oedema during NCS. In this regard, arterial vasodilators should be
avoided and surveillance for peri-operative AF is of paramount importance. Management of anticoagulation for patients with high
thrombotic risk is discussed in Section 5.3.2. In asymptomatic patients
with moderate-to-severe MS and SPAP .50 mmHg, and in symptomatic patients, the peri-operative risk of CV events is increased.

3878 ESC Guidelines


In this case, a percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC) should
be considered before high-risk NCS. Otherwise, a multidisciplinary
team should manage patients with moderate-to-severe MS who
are ineligible for PMC, and NCS should be performed only if necessary. Intermediate-risk NCS may be performed in asymptomatic patients with severe MS with appropriate intra-operative and
post-operative haemodynamic monitoring, if valve morphology is un
suitable for PMC.

6.3.2.3. Aortic valve regurgitation
In patients with mild-to-moderate aortic valve regurgitation (AR),
NCS can be performed without additional risk. Patients with severe

AR in whom valvular intervention is needed should be treated be
fore intermediate-or-high-risk elective NCS (see Recommendation
Table 21 and the 2021 ESC/EACTS Guidelines for the management
of valvular heart disease). [245]

6.3.2.4. Mitral valve regurgitation
In patients with severe symptomatic mitral valve regurgitation (MR),
the type of valve disease (primary or secondary) and LV function
should be assessed. Patients with secondary MR, especially of
ischaemic aetiology, are at increased risk of CV complications
during NCS. [430] Patients with severe symptomatic MR fulfilling the

intervention criteria should be referred for valve treatment

before intermediate- or high-risk elective NCS. In case of
symptomatic moderate-to-severe secondary MR, patients meeting
the Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip
Percutaneous Therapy for Heart Failure Patients With Functional
Mitral Regurgitation (COAPT) criteria should be considered
for transcatheter edge-to-edge treatment before NCS
(Figure 14). [245][,][431] In patients with severe primary MR with symptoms
or asymptomatic with LV dysfunction, valve repair is the recommended therapy (see Recommendation Table 21 and the 2021 ESC/
EACTS Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [245] ).
In patients with reduced LVEF and concomitant AR or MR,
intra-operative haemodynamic monitoring, heart rate control, and
careful fluid balance are crucial to avoid haemodynamic deterioration, especially during high-risk surgery.

6.3.2.5. Patients with prosthetic valve(s)
Patients who have undergone previous surgical correction of VHD
and have a prosthetic valve can undergo NCS provided that there
is no evidence of valve dysfunction. In current practice, the main
problem is the need for a modification of the anticoagulation regimen
in the peri-operative period; this is discussed in detail in Section 5.3.

Prophylaxis against infective endocarditis in patients requiring NCS
should be consistent with the 2015 ESC Guidelines for the management of infective endocarditis. [432]

6.4. Known or newly diagnosed
arrhythmias
Arrhythmias pose a significant burden to patients undergoing NCS,
contributing to excessive morbidity and mortality. [433][,][434]

—
6.4.1. Peri-operative management general

measures

—
Arrhythmias namely, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and ven
—
tricular tachycardia (VT) may accompany acute surgical illness, but
should not defer urgent surgical procedures, unless the arrhythmia
is life-threatening. All patients with known arrhythmia undergoing
elective surgery should have a 12-lead ECG performed preoperatively and undergo a cardiology check-up. Prevention of potential arrhythmic triggers is crucial: electrolyte and acid-base imbalance,
myocardial ischaemia (also caused by excessive blood loss and anaemia), and large volume shifts, which can provoke subsequent autonomic hyperactivity, should be avoided in the pre-, intra-, and
post-operative periods. Patients with a systolic HF should receive optimal treatment, as such therapy reduces the risk of total mortality
and sudden cardiac death (SCD). [435] Patients already taking AADs
should generally not stop taking these drugs. Patients at high-risk of
malignant arrhythmias should have continuous ECG monitoring
through the whole peri-operative period, with particular emphasis
placed on patients who have had implantable cardioverter–defibrillators (ICDs) deactivated during NCS.

6.4.2. Supraventricular arrhythmias
Supraventricular arrhythmias do not usually cause deferral of surgery. In rare cases, presence of pre-excitation and AF conducted rapidly over an accessory pathway flag a patient at risk of SCD and may
indicate the need for ablation, if surgery is not emergent.
Supraventricular premature beats usually do not require therapy.
Identification and correction of potential triggers (electrolyte and
acid-base imbalance, volume overload, etc.) are highly recommended. Peri-operative SVT typically responds well to vagal manoeuvres, or to a bolus of adenosine if unsuccessful. If SVT persists
or reoccurs, i.v. beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem can be used
for rhythm conversion or temporal slowing of atrioventricular conduction. [436] Prompt cardioversion should be performed in rare cases
of haemodynamically unstable SVT. If prophylactic therapy is needed
to prevent recurrent SVT, beta-blockers or non-dihydropyridine
CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem) can be used, and flecainide/propafenone
or amiodarone can be considered if ineffective. Rarely, when SVT
recurs despite therapy or becomes incessant, ablation should be
considered in patients undergoing high-risk, non-emergent surgery. Recently published results of an RCT confirmed the superiority of radiofrequency (RF) ablation over AADs for persistent
atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia. Large registries and
meta-analyses have demonstrated efficacy and safety of RF ablation in WPW syndrome and other SVTs, with a single-procedure
success rate of .90. [437][–][441]

6.4.3. Atrial fibrillation/flutter
The majority of patients with AF receive lifelong OAC therapy for
the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, [99] and the perioperative management of OAC therapy will depend on the type


of surgery (see Section 5.3.2). [99][,][240] Sometimes AF is asymptomatic [442]

and may be first detected on admission for surgery, or may first occur
in the pre-operative period. The initial management of newly diagnosed
AF includes prevention of thromboembolism, and symptom control,
and should not be deferred awaiting consultation with a cardiologist. [99]

In patients with newly diagnosed AF who require systemic OAC therapy for stroke prevention, the choice of anticoagulant in the preoperative period depends on the type of surgery (see Section 5.3.2).
Optimal rate control (i.e. resting heart rate,110 b.p.m.) [99] is mandatory in all patients with AF, whereas rhythm control (i.e. achieving
and maintenance of sinus rhythm) in the pre-operative period may
be considered only if symptoms persist despite optimal rate control.
Rate control can be achieved using beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem). Amiodarone can be
used as first-line therapy in patients with HF, whereas digoxin is usually ineffective in high adrenergic conditions such as surgery.
Pharmacological cardioversion of symptomatic recent-onset AF
can be attempted using flecainide or propafenone; in patients without significant LV hypertrophy, LV systolic dysfunction, or IHD,
the use of flecainide or propafenone results in prompt (3–5 h) and
safe restoration of sinus rhythm in .50% of patients. Intravenous
amiodarone administration has a limited and delayed effect but can
slow the heart rate within 12 h; i.v. vernakalant is the most rapidly
cardioverting drug, including patients with mild HF and/or
IHD. [99][,][443] Dofetilide is not used in Europe, and ibutilide is effective
to convert atrial flutter to sinus rhythm. [99][,][444] In patients with AF
and haemodynamic instability, emergency cardioversion (most commonly electrical direct current cardioversion) is indicated. [99]

Alternatively, pharmacological cardioversion using i.v. AADs should
be attempted, if consistent with the patient’s clinical status.
Systemic OAC therapy to prevent thromboembolic events should
be started as soon as possible. [99] Post-operative AF is discussed in

Section 8.6.

Management of atrial flutter follows the same principles as AF with
respect to OAC therapy. Rate control is usually an initial approach in
patients with atrial flutter; [436] however, drugs that slow atrioventricular conduction (digoxin, beta-blockers, or non-dihydropyridine
CCBs) are usually less effective than in AF. In patients with a high ventricular rate, electrical cardioversion is frequently needed. [445][–][448]

Amiodarone may be an alternative used to control rate, especially
in HF or critically compromised patients. [449] Dofetilide and ibutilide
are effective in converting atrial flutter to sinus rhythm, whereas class
IA and IC drugs and amiodarone are less efficient and should not be
used. [450][–][453]

6.4.4. Ventricular arrhythmias
Premature ventricular contractions (PVC) and non-sustained VT are
frequent in the general population and patients undergoing NCS.
Specific clinical features have been suggested as predictors of increasing incidence of PVC. [454] These arrhythmias have historically been
considered benign; however, recent studies have suggested that
they may be associated with an adverse outcome, even in patients
with apparently normal hearts, especially if frequent (e.g. .10–
20%). [455][–][459] In patients with heart disease, the prognostic impact
of PVC and non-sustained VT depends on type and extent of
heart damage. [460][–][466] In patients undergoing urgent NCS, they
do not require treatment unless frequent and symptomatic.

If haemodynamically compromising, up-titration of beta-blockers is recommended; amiodarone (300 mg i.v. bolus) should be considered if
beta-blockers are not tolerated or contraindicated. [467] Further diagnostics to rule out significant heart disease is necessary in patients
awaiting elective NCS, especially if frequent, complex (non-sustained
VT), symptomatic, or in those with a positive family history of SCD.
Polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF) can be provoked
by ischaemia, electrolyte imbalance, or may be manifestations of primary electrical disease, such as long-QT or Brugada syndrome.
Monomorphic VT is often associated with the presence of scarred
myocardium. Hence, peri-operative VT or VF in a patient awaiting
surgery should lead to a diagnostic work-up to exclude severe ventricular dysfunction (see Section 4.5.1), and to rule out CAD requiring
prompt revascularization (see Section 6.1) and other potential causes
of arrhythmia (primary electrical disease, dyselectrolytaemia).
Monomorphic VT in patients without overt structural or electrical
heart disease (idiopathic VT, most commonly arising from outflow
tract) is associated with good prognosis and may be left untreated
or, if symptomatic, may be treated with beta-blockers, verapamil,
or sodium channel blockers. Patients with haemodynamically compromising VT should undergo electrical cardioversion (after i.v. sedation, if conscious) and VF should be terminated with prompt
defibrillation. Recurrent VT and VF in the setting of acute ischaemia
may be effectively treated with beta-blockers and amiodarone, and
myocardial revascularization in case of obstructive CAD. [468]

Up-titration of beta-blockers to the maximal tolerated doses can
prevent arrhythmia recurrence. [469]

Haemodynamically stable, sustained VT should be cardioverted as
a first-line treatment; i.v. procainamide or flecainide may be considered in patients without HF or myocardial ischaemia. In cases in
which these drugs are unavailable, i.v. amiodarone can be used. In selected cases, when monomorphic VT recurs in patients with scarred


myocardium with no reversible causes, despite optimal therapy, invasive electrophysiological study and ablation should be performed
pre-operatively, if NCS can be deferred. After extensive endocardial
VT ablation, treatment with an OAC for a limited period of time
might be reasonable. [470][,][471] A summary of diagnostic and therapeutic
pathways in patients with SVT or VT is shown in Table 12.

6.4.5. Bradyarrhythmias
Temporary cardiac pacing during the peri-operative period should
be limited to patients undergoing urgent NCS, if bradycardia is
haemodynamically compromising despite i.v. chronotropic drugs,
or provokes episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmia. [481] In patients
undergoing elective NCS, surgery should be deferred if possible,
and permanent pacemaker should be implanted, if indications for pacing are fulfilled. [481] Prophylactic pacing in the settings of asymptomatic bifascicular block, with or without first-degree atrioventricular
block, is generally not indicated, and chronotropic drugs (atropine,
isoprenaline, adrenaline, or, alternatively, aminophylline, dopamine,
or glucagon in beta-blocker or CCB overdosing) are usually effective.
Patients with bifascicular bundle branch block or prolonged
His-ventricular interval are at an increased risk of developing complete heart block. [482][,][483] Equipment needed to perform emergent
transcutaneous pacing and personnel able to perform such a procedure should be immediately available during NCS in patients with bifascicular block; alternatively, a permanent pacemaker may be
implanted. [481]

6.4.6. Management of patients with cardiac
implantable electronic devices
Patients with CIEDs can undergo NCS, pending adequate perioperative device management. A pre-operative check should have
been performed at least once within the 12 months preceding surgery for pacemaker patients and within 6 months for patients with
ICD, in the absence of any malfunction (remote monitoring can
also be used for check-ups). [484][,][485] In pacing-dependent patients, patients with biventricular pacing for CRT, and ICD-recipients undergoing elective NCS associated with risk of electromagnetic
interference (EMI) (e.g. involving the use of unipolar electrocoagulation, especially above the umbilicus), CIED check and reprogramming
should be performed immediately before surgery. In pacemakerdependent patients, devices should be reprogrammed to nonsensing or asynchronous pacing mode to protect against inhibition
of the pacemaker. This can be performed in the majority of pacemaker models by placing a magnet over the pacemaker can. [486][,][487]

However, magnet mode in modern pacemakers, except Medtronic
and Sorin/Livanova/Microport, is programmable and may not be
asynchronous pacing; thus, magnet application is not a universal remedy against EMI-induced malfunction. Furthermore, asynchronous


pacing may lead to pacing on the T wave, which can provoke VT/
VF. However, the risk of clinically significant EMI is low [487][–][489] and
a practical solution would be to monitor the patient via plethysmography or an arterial line, and limit the use of electrocautery if pauses
occur during ECG monitoring.
Patients with leadless pacemakers may safely undergo surgery,
with precautions similar to patients with conventional pacemakers,
avoiding EMI and after reprogramming the pacemaker into nonsensing mode in pacing-dependent patients (due to its intracardiac

location and lack of a Hall-effect sensor/reed switch, this device can
not be temporarily reprogrammed to an asynchronous mode with a
magnet applied over the body of the pacemaker). [490][,][491]

In patients with ICDs undergoing NCS with anticipated risk of EMI,
arrhythmia detection or antiarrhythmic therapies through the device
should be switched off before NCS, [492] or a magnet should be put
over the device. [488][,][489][,][492] All modern ICDs will respond to magnet
application by inhibiting antitachycardia therapy, while the brady pacing is left intact. Deactivation by programming mandates telemetry
and cardioversion equipment until reactivation, which may be impractical. Furthermore, there is a risk that the patient is discharged
without the device being reactivated. These factors would favour
the use of a magnet instead of deactivation. In some patients where
the device is inaccessible for magnet application, a magnet cannot be
used and reprogramming is mandatory. From this point onwards,
throughout the whole procedure until reactivation of the ICD, the
patient should have continuous ECG monitoring, and personnel
skilled in early detection of arrhythmias, defibrillation, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation manoeuvres should be present. As soon as
possible after NCS, it is recommended that the ICD is checked
and therapies switched on. [485]

Patients with subcutaneous ICD can undergo surgery after switching off the antiarrhythmic therapy or magnet application; however, if
thoracic surgery is planned, especially with a median sternotomy, the
surgeon should be aware of the presence of the ICD and the
course of the subcutaneous electrode. This can prevent mechanical
damage of the lead, the direct use of electrocautery on the electrode,
or the placement of sternal wires in close proximity to the sensing
electrodes. [493]

In pacing-dependent patients, patients with CRT, and ICD patients, EMI with the device should be avoided (e.g. with electrocautery). Use of bipolar electrocautery, short bursts of impulses
limited to several seconds (,5 s), with the lowest effective energy,
and operating with a pen or stylus away from the device (.15 cm)

can minimize the risk of interference with the device. In the case

of unipolar electrocoagulation, the electrosurgical unit should be
connected in a way that keeps the current circuit away from the

CIED can and electrodes. However, the manufacturer’s recommen
dations should be considered (usually recommending placement of
the indifferent electrode on the opposite site of the body to the
one operated on, but possibly close to the surgical site, on a wellvascularized, muscular area). Consequently, the indifferent return
pad should be placed as far away from the CIED as possible, keeping
the surgical site between the CIED and the return electrode
(Figure 15). [494][–][497]

In patients with implantable loop recorders (especially those not
undergoing remote monitoring and regular downloads of the
CIED memory), the device memory download is to be considered

6.5. Adult congenital heart disease
Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) account for .60% of
the population with congenital heart disease (CHD). [500][,][501]

Accordingly, ACHD represent an increasing proportion of NCS admissions [502] and might be at high risk of CV events.
Pre-operative risk assessment in ACHD needs to focus on the
underlying disease, type of surgery, residua, and sequelae. [503]

Coexistence of HF, pulmonary hypertension, arrhythmia, hypoxaemia, damage to other organs, and endocarditis may considerably
influence the baseline risk of these patients from no additional risk
to very high risk of worse prognosis. [503][,][504] Thus, original medical
and surgical reports should be obtained along with current data,
which should include symptoms, exercise capacity, oxygen saturation, laboratory values (BNP, haemoglobin, creatinine, etc.), and

medication.

ESC Guidelines 3883


Table 13 Risk stratification for non-cardiac surgery
in adults with congenital heart disease

|Severe risk|Patients with uncorrected cyanotic heart disease,<br>pulmonary hypertension, other complex CHD,<br>ventricular dysfunction requiring medication, and<br>patients listed for heart transplantation|


CHD, congenital heart disease.

In a recent report, absolute mortality in ACHD patients undergoing NCS exceeded 4%. [502] Mortality and peri-operative morbidity
were greater in ACHD compared with a matched comparison cohort, and patients with severe ACHD had the highest mortality
rate. It is well known that patients with pulmonary hypertension
and with Eisenmenger syndrome have a higher risk of complications. [505] A large registry confirmed these findings: patients with severe CHD had an increased risk of 30 day mortality, overall
mortality, and reintubation, while patients with intermediate CHD
had a moderate increase in overall mortality and risk of reintubation. [506] Based on this study and recent guidelines, [503] the classification
in Table 13 is proposed for risk stratification.
A consultation by an ACHD specialist is necessary, especially in pa
tients with intermediate or severe ACHD scheduled for

intermediate- or high-risk NCS. It is recommended that elective surgery in intermediate- and severe-risk ACHD patients should take
place in centres experienced in the management of ACHD patients.
It is generally recommended to perform the least invasive procedures and anaesthesia with as low an impact on haemodynamics as
possible.
Optimal peri-operative care in ACHD undergoing NCS starts
with a proper pre-operative evaluation. Adults with congenital heart
disease can present with multiorgan involvement (kidneys, liver, lung,
and endocrine system), which should be considered during the diagnostic work-up. [503] In many cases, patients with ACHD have a lifelong
indication for OAC therapy or antithrombotic treatment, mainly due
to arrhythmias or increased thromboembolic risk associated with
specific ACHD. Oral anticoagulant therapy in the peri-operative
phase should be re-evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The
CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score has not been validated in ACHD patients
and should not be used in this group.
Continuous haemodynamic monitoring can be necessary in patients with ACHD and should include invasive BP monitoring, especially in cases with ACHD of moderate or severe complexity. It is
worth mentioning that, according to the type of ACHD or surgery
(e.g. coarctation of the aorta or following a Blalock-Taussig shunt),
the location of the arterial line for continuous BP and gas exchange
monitoring requires careful attention. In patients with persistent


right-to-left shunts, air filters must be used for venous access.
Ventilator management and extubation can be complicated by the
presence of restrictive lung disease. [507] Antibiotic prophylaxis for
endocarditis should be given according to the 2015 ESC Guidelines
for the management of infective endocarditis. [432] Furthermore, postoperative care in an ICU with experience in handling ACHD patients
is often necessary.
A prolonged monitoring period in this setting should be considered, with a special focus on arrhythmias and an optimal volume
management, as it has been shown that up to 50% of adverse events
were attributable to lapses in the post-operative monitoring and
care. [508] Two groups at special risk are patients with chronic cyanosis
and those after the Fontan procedure. Chronic cyanosis is associated
with multiorgan involvement. Furthermore, bleeding risk is higher
due to multiple collaterals, platelet dysfunction, and alterations in
the coagulation cascade. [509] In patients with Eisenmenger syndrome,
conditions that increase pulmonary vascular resistance such as hypothermia, metabolic acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypovolaemia must be
avoided. [509] This is also true for patients after the Fontan procedure,
where venous return relies on low pulmonary pressures. If
intra-abdominal pressure rises too high in these patients, venous return is drastically reduced, with a subsequent drop in cardiac output.
These haemodynamic aspects should be carefully considered in cases
of laparoscopic or open NCS.

6.6. Pericardial diseases

Active pericardial disease is infrequent at the time of NCS, but potentially life-threatening. The clarification of underlying aetiology is
of utmost importance for peri-operative management (viral or bacterial infection, malignant, systemic autoimmune, metabolic, or autoreactive disease). The treatment of these conditions should follow
the recommendations provided in the 2015 ESC Guidelines for
the diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases. [510]

Acute pericarditis is a clear indication to postpone an elective surgical procedure. However, in cases of undeferrable NCS, attention is
required regarding drug-to-drug interactions. The frequently used
colchicine is predominantly metabolized through the liver, while re
–
nal excretion accounts for only 10 20%. Colchicine may increase

sensitivity to central nervous system depressants and exert a respira
                                         tory depressant effect. [511] Adverse events of peri-operative signifi
cance include diarrhoea, worsening renal failure, and, very rarely,
bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, paralysis, convulsions,
and cardiopulmonary collapse. Immunosuppressive drugs such as
steroids and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist agents suppress the
immune system, and may increase the risk of infection and delay
wound healing in the peri-operative phase. [511]

Imminent cardiac tamponade is an absolute contraindication for all
surgical procedures, especially when a general anaesthesia is required. [510][,][512] Before NCS, pericardial effusion should first be percutaneously drained, under local anaesthesia. In cases of small or
moderate chronic pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis,
attention should be paid to take measurements to increase cardiac
pre-load. The pre-load should be optimized peri-operatively with
i.v. fluids prior to general anaesthetic induction to facilitate ventricular filling. Manipulation and medication diminishing venous return to
the heart should be avoided or minimized. Positive pressure ventilation might cause a dramatic decline in pre-load and should be
avoided. If spontaneous breathing is not possible, ventilation with
minimal inspiratory pressures (low tidal volumes, high respiratory
rate) should be considered. Anaesthetics that minimize changes in
heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, venous return, and myocardial contractility should be selected. [189] Ketamine, a sympathetic
stimulant that preserves spontaneous ventilation, is the drug of first
choice. Combinations of opiates, benzodiazepines, and nitric oxide,
with or without low doses of volatile anaesthetics, are acceptable

for maintenance of anaesthesia. Muscle relaxants with minimal circu
latory effects should be preferred, although the modest increase in
heart rate observed with administration of pancuronium is also
acceptable.

6.7. Pulmonary disease and pulmonary
arterial hypertension
The coexistence of pulmonary disease in cardiac patients undergoing
NCS may increase the operative risk. Pre-existing pulmonary disease
has a significant impact on peri-operative risk, but the most common


effect is an increase in the risk of post-operative pulmonary complications. These complications particularly occur after abdominal or
thoracic surgery, and the risk seems to be increased in smokers.
Certain respiratory conditions are associated with CV pathology
and may require special cardiac risk assessment and management,
in addition to dealing with the pulmonary disease per se. Three
such conditions are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH).

6.7.1. Pulmonary disease
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. [513] Although patients with COPD have an in
creased risk of CVD, there is no evidence that COPD is related to

a higher risk of peri-operative cardiac complications. However,
post-operative pulmonary complications result in significant mortality and morbidity. Pre-operative evaluation, using specific postoperative pulmonary complication tools, can be used to stratify
at-risk patients and enable optimal pre-operative and perioperative management. [514] In patients with COPD undergoing
NCS, the pre-operative treatment goals are to optimize pulmonary function and minimize post-operative respiratory complications; this includes using the pre-operative period for education,
including possible cessation of smoking (2 months before surgery),
instruction concerning chest physiotherapy and lung expansion
manoeuvres, muscular endurance training, and re-nutrition if required. Beta-adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic agents should
be continued until the day of surgery in all symptomatic COPD patients with bronchial hyper-reactivity. In some cases, short-term
systemic/inhaled steroids may be considered. Where there is active pulmonary infection, appropriate antibiotics should be administered for at least 10 days and, if possible, elective NCS should
be deferred. [515]

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is defined as the triad of obesity, daytime hypoventilation, and sleep-disordered breathing.
Although distinct from simple obesity and sleep apnoea, it is estimated that 90% patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome
also have obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The prevalence of obesity
hypoventilation syndrome is 0.15–3% of adults and 7–22% in patients
undergoing bariatric surgery. [516] Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is
associated with even higher morbidity, including HF (and
obesity-related cardiomyopathy), angina pectoris, pulmonary hyper
–
tension (30 88%) and cor pulmonale, and increased peri-operative
mortality. [516] Patients at high risk of obesity hypoventilation syndrome who are undergoing NCS should be referred for additional
specialist investigation of sleep-disordered breathing and pulmonary
hypertension, with pre-operative initiation of appropriate
positive airway pressure therapy, and planning of peri-operative
techniques (anaesthetic and surgical) and post-operative positive airway pressure management within an appropriate monitored
environment. [516][,][517]

6.7.2. Pulmonary arterial hypertension
Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with increased
morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing NCS. [518]

A meticulous pre-operative diagnostic work-up in this subset of
patients should include assessment of functional status and severity of disease, in addition to comorbidities and the type of
NCS. Echocardiography and right heart catheterization (if clinically indicated) are key components in the pre-operative work-up.
The morbidity and mortality associated with PAH derive from
the haemodynamic response of the right ventricle to acute increases in afterload. [519]

In patients with severe PAH, peri-operative mortality ranging
between 3–18% has been reported, depending on the
severity of the underlying disease, and the nature and urgency of
the surgical procedure. Emergency procedures are also associated
with a high risk of complications. [520][,][521] Patient-related and
surgery-related factors should be considered when assessing perioperative risk in patients with PAH (Table 14). [522] Owing to the
potential for anaesthesia and surgery to be complicated by acute
right HF and pulmonary hypertensive crisis, elective NCS in patients with PAH should be adequately discussed in a multidisciplinary team. Ideally, patients with PAH undergoing NCS should have
optimal medical treatment before surgery and be managed in a
centre experienced in PAH. Patients scheduled for NCS should
be discussed by a pneumologist, cardiologist, surgeon, and an
anaesthesiologist. [523] The management of patients with PAH in
the peri-operative setting should follow the recommendations
provided in the 2022 ESC/ERS Guidelines for the diagnosis and
treatment of pulmonary hypertension. [524]

Several novel therapies aimed at reducing pulmonary pressures
are used pre-operatively in patients undergoing NCS. Of these
therapies, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase
inhibitors, and prostacyclin analogues are the most used. [525]

This medication should be continued during the peri-operative
phase because therapy disruption may lead to a critical rebound
of the PAH. Inhaled nitric oxide allows selective pulmonary vasodilatation with rapidity of action and it can be given to patients

who develop worsening pulmonary hypertension postoperatively to maintain right ventricular (RV) function and
haemodynamic stability. [526]

6.8. Arterial hypertension
The prevalence of arterial hypertension in adults in Europe is
≏30–45%. [527] Of these patients,,40% have well-controlled BP
(,140/90 mmHg). A large observational study has shown that patients with untreated hypertension 1 month before surgery had a
69% increased risk of 90 day post-operative mortality. [183] Further,
overall CV risk assessment, including the search for hypertensionmediated organ damage, is of paramount importance in hypertensive patients, and mandatory when there is newly detected BP
elevation. [528]

Postponing surgery is usually not advised in patients with grade
1 or 2 hypertension. In contrast, in subjects with a systolic BP
≥180 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg, deferring the
intervention until BP is under control is advisable, except for
emergency surgery. [236][,][527][,][529][,][530] It also seems important to avoid
large peri-operative BP fluctuations. In a recent randomized trial
among patients undergoing abdominal surgery, an individualized
intra-operative treatment strategy with systolic BP values kept
within a 10% difference from the pre-operative office measurement resulted in a reduced risk of post-operative organ dysfunction. [528] In a meta-analysis including 130 862 patients undergoing
surgery, intra-operative hypotension was associated with

5.55). [531] In patients with hypertension, hypoperfusion may occur
at higher BP levels and peri-operative BP control should be tailored to pre-operative levels. [528]

In patients referred for elective NCS, control of BP should be
prioritized, especially in patients with systolic BP .160 mmHg.
The management of patients with hypertension in the pre-operative
setting should follow the recommendation provided in the 2018
ESC/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Guidelines for the
management of arterial hypertension. [529] These guidelines advocate
an approach using RAAS inhibitors (in patients aged,70 years) or
CCBs (in patients aged .70 years) as single therapy in moderate
hypertension and both in combination where dual therapy is
needed, adding a diuretic and an aldosterone antagonist if additional medication is needed for adequate control. Beta-blockers are restricted to patients where it is specifically indicated. [529] In patients
with hypertension and a clear indication for beta-blocker, third
—
generation beta-blockers such as carvedilol, celiprolol, labetolol,
and nebivolol—have superior antihypertensive effects compared

with other beta-blockers and fewer adverse effects, but there
are no RCTs reporting outcomes in hypertensive patients. [529] In
a large observational study, a beta-blocker prescription prior to
NCS was associated with lower 30 day mortality in patients with
three or four cardiac risk factors. [188] However, for patients with
no cardiac risk factors, the risk of death was significantly increased
with beta-blockers. [188][,][532]

Most patients with stage 3 hypertension on the day of surgery
will be classified as hypertensive urgencies. In these cases, the
2018 ESC/ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hyper
tension recommend ACEIs, CCBs, or diuretics. Neither ACEIs

nor diuretics are recommended on the day of surgery. The use
of CCBs is supported by a meta-analysis of 11 studies of CCBs during NCS. [220] Further, a study of 989 well-controlled patients with
hypertension without hypertension-related organ damage, testing
the use of fast-acting nasal nifedipine when stage 3 hypertension
(systolic BP .180 and/or diastolic BP .110 mmHg) was diagnosed
the day of NCS, found no difference in outcome between administration of nifedipine and surgery on the same day compared with
deferral for hypertension control before resuming surgery. [533]

Immediate nifedipine treatment was associated with shorter hospital stays. As this was the first study testing the need for deferral
of stage 3 hypertension, it challenged the need for this practice. For
patients with hypertensive emergencies (systolic BP .180 and/or
diastolic BP .110 mmHg and organ damage), the 2018 ESC/ESH
Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension recommend labetolol, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, etc., according to
the affected organ. [529]

The timing of administration of the antihypertensive drugs, and
their continuation or discontinuation in the peri-operative period

is discussed in Section 5.2.

6.9. Peripheral artery disease
Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) usually have advanced
atherosclerotic disease affecting multiple vascular beds in varying degrees and have a worse prognosis compared with patients without
PAD. [534][–][538] Patients with PAD generally differ in their risk profiles, according to whether they undergo vascular or non-vascular NCS.

6.9.1. Peripheral artery disease and non-vascular
non-cardiac surgery
Decisions on pre-operative treatment of pre-existing PAD and AAA
in patients scheduled for non-vascular NCS should be made on an
individual basis, taking into account symptoms and risks of surgery.
Non-cardiac surgery should be prioritized in patients needing revascularization for PAD, but careful peri-operative monitoring of deterioration in lower extremity perfusion is warranted, particularly in
those patients with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia (e.g. peripheral BP of ≤50–70 mmHg in the foot joint and ≤30–50 mmHg in
the toes). [539] For patients with AAA, pain control is essential to
ensure stable BP, minimizing rupture risk. Patients with large AAA
(i.e. .5 cm in diameter for women and .5.5 cm for men) should
be evaluated for aortic aneurysm repair (preferably EVAR) [540][–][542]

before non-vascular NCS is planned, particularly in the case of
malignant tumours, depending on the stage of malignant disease.

6.9.2. Peripheral artery disease and vascular
non-cardiac surgery
The 2017 ESC Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial diseases [535] and the European Society for Vascular
Surgery (ESVS) 2019 Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management
of abdominal aorto-iliac artery aneurysms [35] provide detailed evidence

NCS and their treatment modality selection. Notably, there is randomized evidence against prophylactic coronary revascularization before major vascular surgery in CCS patients due to lack of benefit
in improvement of peri-operative and long-term outcomes (2.7 years
mean follow-up). [399] Assessment of functional capacity might offer
guidance to select candidates for cardiac assessment prior to major
NCS, although severe walking impairment may challenge this test.
The previously established risk predictive model to detect mortality
in patients undergoing elective AAA repair may be helpful. [543]

Low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin initiated within 10 days after a lower limb revascularization procedure reduces post-operative thrombotic events (acute limb ischaemia, amputation, MI, ischaemic
stroke, and CV death) in patients undergoing lower limb revascularization, whether it is carried out using an endovascular or open surgical approach. [544] Handling of other co-drugs should follow the

recommendations detailed in Section 5.2.

debate. Importantly, the purpose of carotid revascularization in this
setting is more the long-term prevention of stroke than perioperative stroke risk reduction; therefore, if carotid revascularization
is indicated, this may be performed before or after the planned NCS.
Independent of the revascularization strategy, patients with carotid
artery stenosis benefit from aggressive CV risk-factor modification
to prevent peri-operative myocardial ischaemia.

6.10. Cerebrovascular disease

Patients undergoing NCS should be questioned about previous neurological symptoms, and those with symptoms suggestive of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke in the preceding 6 months should
undergo pre-operative neurological consultation and neurovascular and
brain imaging, if appropriate. In the absence of dedicated studies addressingthisissue,thecriteriaforcarotidrevascularizationinsymptomaticand
asymptomatic patients is described in detail in the 2017 ESC Guidelines
on the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial diseases, in collaboration with the ESVS; these guidelines should also guide the management
of patients with carotid disease who are undergoing NCS. [535]

In patients with symptomatic carotid disease, the benefit of carotid
revascularization is particularly high in patients with recent (,3
months) TIA or stroke, and ≥70% carotid artery stenosis. Thus, carotid revascularization should be performed first and elective NCS
should be postponed. [545]

The question as to whether patients with severe asymptomatic carotid occlusive disease who are undergoing elective major NCS require pre-operative carotid revascularization remains a matter of

6.11. Renal disease

Renal disease is associated with several cardiac comorbidities, including
hypertension, HF, CAD, and arrhythmias. [546] Consistently, renal disease
portends a significant increase in the post-operative risk of CV events,
including MI, stroke, and progression of HF in patients undergoing NCS.
For this reason, most risk indices for the quantification of pre-operative
risk in patients undergoing NCS include renal function.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined as impaired kidney function or raised proteinuria, confirmed on two or more occasions at
least 3 months apart. The kidney function can be assessed through
the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated using the
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula, including sex, age, ethnic origin, and serum creatinine concentration. A cut-off glomerular filtration rate (GFR) value,60 mL/min/
1.73 m [2] significantly correlates with MACEs. Identification of cardiac
patients at risk of worsening of renal function in the peri-operative
phase of NCS is of paramount importance, in order to initiate supportive measures such as maintenance of adequate intravascular volume for renal perfusion and use of vasopressors. [547]

Patients with cardiac comorbidities are prone to develop AKI after
major NCS, due to worsening of haemodynamic status associated
with fluids or blood loss, and withdrawal or continuation of
cardio-active therapies. The peri-operative management of patients
undergoing NCS and treated with cardio-active drugs has been discussed in Section 5.2. Acute kidney injury reduces long-term survival
in patients with normal baseline renal function. [548] Of interest,
≏30–40% of all cases of AKI occur after surgery and the incidence

–
of post-operative AKI ranges 18 47%. Risk factors for the development of post-operative AKI following NCS include cardiac

3888 ESC Guidelines


(decompensated or chronic HF, hypertension, cardio-active drugs)
and non-cardiac triggers (age, sex, emergent, and/or intraperitoneal surgery, mild pre-operative renal insufficiency, pre-operative
creatinine elevation, CKD, and DM). [549][,][550] The combination of a
low cardiac output/high venous pressure and/or the administration
of iodinated contrast media during diagnostic and operative procedures represent the most frequent causes of AKI in hospitalized cardiac patients, regardless of pre-existing impaired renal function.
Contrast-induced AKI is defined as a rise in serum creatinine of
44 mmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) or a 25% relative rise from baseline at 48 h

–
(or 5 10% at 12 h) following contrast administration. It occurs in
up to 15% of patients with CKD who are undergoing radiographic
procedures. [551] Although most cases of contrast-induced AKI are
self-limiting, with renal function returning to normal within 7 days

–
of the procedure, these patients occasionally (0.5 12% of cases) develop overt renal failure associated with increased morbidity and
mortality. To reduce the risk of contrast-induced AKI in subjects requiring contrast-enhanced radiography, the Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines
recommend: pre-operative hydration with i.v. isotonic fluids; the

use of the minimum volume of contrast media; and the use of low
osmolar or iso-osmolar contrast media, regardless of pre-existing renal disease. [547] In the post-operative phase, kidney function should be
monitored by applying established AKI scoring systems to raise
awareness and enable early intervention. [552]

second leading cause of preventable death following tobacco
use. [558] Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m [2],
morbid obesity as a BMI ≥35 kg/m [2], and super-morbid obesity as a
BMI ≥50 kg/m [2] . Obese individuals have a higher prevalence of CV
risk factors and a higher risk of death, [559] and are a population who
are at increased risk of adverse events in the case of surgical procedures. There are specific recommendations for the pre-operative
risk assessment of obese patients undergoing NCS, regardless of the
presence of pre-existing cardiac conditions. [560] However, while obesity accelerates the propensity for CVD, it seems that many types of
CVD may have a better prognosis in the overweight population compared with their leaner counterparts, a phenomenon that is known as
the ‘obesity paradox’. [561][,][562] Similarly, in cases of NCS, mildly obese patients present lower mortality risk compared with underweight and
normal weight patients, both post-operatively and at long-term
follow-up. [563] This finding may be related to the lower prevalence of
PMI in mildly obese patients undergoing NCS. [564]

It has been suggested that cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), rather
than BMI, should be used to assess CV risk in obese patients. While
the classification based on BMI is simple, highly reproducible, and
widely adopted in clinical practice, it does not reflect fat distribution
and body composition. Cardiorespiratory fitness refers to the ability
of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity, which is of paramount
importance, especially in patients with cardiac diseases. The primary
measure of CRF is VO 2 max. [565] A cohort study of nearly 10 000 patients with CAD followed for almost 15 years showed that those
with relatively good CRF had favourable prognosis regardless of
body composition; [566] however, a lower CRF was found to be a
major predictor of mortality, regardless of BMI. [561][,][567] Whether
specific optimization and/or treatment strategies might have a
positive impact on the outcome of obese patients with preexisting or newly diagnosed cardiac comorbidities and scheduled
for NCS is a matter of ongoing controversy. Studies assessing
the effect of weight loss interventions (low-energy diets with or
without an exercise component) on clinical outcomes in patients
undergoing NCS found inconsistent results in terms of perioperative morbidity or mortality. [568][,][569]

6.13. Diabetes

Due to the progressive ageing of the population undergoing surgical procedures and the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes among patients undergoing
NCS is expected to increase in years to come. [4][,][571] Several
studies have demonstrated that diabetic patients undergoing
NCS have a higher prevalence of CAD than non-diabetic patients.
Furthermore, patients with diabetes are more likely to have silent
ischaemia because of altered neural pain pathways in the heart. [572]

For this reason, patients with diabetes appear to have a greater
risk of post-operative myocardial ischaemia. Different reasons exist behind the relation between DM and increased peri-operative
mortality in patients undergoing NCS. First, patients with diabetes
are known to have more comorbidity and/or advanced CAD at

the time of intervention. Second, diabetes is a clear risk factor

for stroke. Diabetes is associated with post-operative congestive
HF and wound infections. Many patients with diabetes have impaired renal function. The presence or a new diagnosis of impaired
glucose metabolism in patients scheduled for NCS should follow
the recommendations provided for the general population in
the 2019 ESC Guidelines on diabetes, pre-diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases, [573] including increased awareness regarding possible subclinical organ damage.
The glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) test should be performed in
all patients with diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism scheduled
for NCS, if this measurement has not been performed in the previous 3 months. There is evidence to support that pre-admission optimal treatment of hyperglycaemia in patients scheduled for elective
NCS is effective in reducing the post-operative risk of CV events, including MI, stroke, and progression of HF. [574] In contrast, no clear association has been shown between intra-operative blood glucose
levels and the subsequent risk of surgical site infection, MI, stroke,
and death in patients undergoing NCS. [575] The risk of acidosis associated with metformin use is also debated. [576] Nevertheless, repeated
blood glucose monitoring on the day of surgery is recommended,
with a general consensus to maintain peri-operative glucose levels
,10.0 mmol/L without causing hypoglycaemia (target level 5.6–
10.0 mmol/L). This can be achieved either with subcutaneous doses
of rapid-acting insulin analogues or with i.v. insulin. [577] Handling
of SGLT2 inhibitors in relation to surgery has been discussed in

Section 5.2.

6.14. Cancer

Due to their generally older age, cancer patients have a high prevalence of CV risk factors and CVD, being a population at increased
risk of adverse events in cases of NCS. It is therefore important to
optimize treatment of CV risk factors and known CVD before
NCS, following the general and disease-specific recommendations
provided in other sections of these guidelines. Furthermore, NCS
may be particularly challenging in cancer patients because of previous
administration of potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy or fibrosis
due to previous radiation. For example, the widely used anthracyclines have a dose-dependent relation with the incidence of HF
and the use of trastuzumab can lead to important cardiotoxicity
and should be taken into account in the pre-operative assessment.
Furthermore, radiation therapy to areas that included the heart
may lead to premature CAD and VHD; previous thoracic radiotherapy may predispose younger patients to heart disease who would
otherwise not have an elevated risk. Post-operative AF is frequently
observed in patients undergoing cancer surgery, with the highest incidence reported for lung surgery. Patients with cancer are at elevated risk of thrombosis due to both the disease itself and patientand treatment-related factors. In a small study of patients undergoing

prophylaxis for 4 weeks compared with 1 week reduced the incidence of thrombosis (4.8% in the enoxaparin group vs.12.0% in
the placebo group; P = 0.02). [582] Although later studies have shown
somewhat conflicting results, the consensus is to recommend extending thromboprophylaxis after major abdominal and/or pelvic

6.15. Coronavirus disease 2019

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease
caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). In a recent observational study, among 140 231 patients scheduled for NCS, 2.2% of patients had a pre-operative diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. [585] Patients undergoing surgery with
peri-operative or recent SARS-CoV-2 appear to be at increased risk
of post-operative VTE and mortality compared with patients with no
history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. [586] Furthermore, the possible myocardial injury associated with COVID-19 infection might increase the

intrinsic peri-operative risk of adverse cardiac events associated with
surgical procedures. [587][,][588]

To date, there is no specific CV screening to be performed after
COVID-19 infection in patients scheduled for NCS. The preoperative evaluation of CV risk associated with NCS in this specific
subset of patients should incorporate, beyond the general risk assessment outlined in these guidelines, the severity of COVID-19 disease, history of CV complications during COVID-19 infection, and
functional capacity after recovery. This information is deemed of importance to further optimize timing of surgery and the treatment of
COVID-19-associated cardiovascular conditions affecting the perioperative risk of NCS. [589]

The optimal timing of NCS in patients with a history of COVID-19
infection is largely unknown. Generally, elective NCS should be postponed until complete recovery and optimization of coexisting comorbidities. Registry data of patients undergoing NCS after
COVID-19 infection report increased risks of mortality and morbidity up to 7 weeks post-COVID diagnosis. [586] Another study has reported greater risk of post-operative complications up to 8 weeks
post-diagnosis. [590] However, it should be noted that almost all available data come from study periods with zero to low prevalence of
vaccination, and no robust data exist on patients recovering from

the more recent Delta and Omicron variants.

A joint statement on elective surgery and anaesthesia for patients
after COVID-19 infection from the American Society of
Anaesthesiologists and Anaesthesia Patient Safety Foundation [591]

suggests delaying elective surgery for 7 weeks after a SARS-CoV-2
infection in unvaccinated patients who are asymptomatic at the


time of surgery. The clinical course of COVID-19 infection, presence
and intensity of cardiopulmonary symptoms during the acute and
late phases, and pre-existing comorbidities should be taken into consideration. In addition, persistence of COVID-19 symptoms—such

—
as fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort should be given attention, as this condition is associated with higher postoperative mortality independent of the timing of COVID-19 diagnosis. [588][,][589] The evidence is currently insufficient to make recommen
dations for those who become infected after vaccination.
### 7. Peri-operative monitoring and anaesthesia

7.1. Peri-operative monitoring
Despite the absence of prospective RCTs investigating the prognostic relevance of peri-operative monitoring, previous evidence clearly
indicates that the routine use of monitoring improves safety of surgical procedures. Mandatory intra-operative monitoring of the CV
and respiratory systems, temperature, neuromuscular transmission,
and depth of anaesthesia is recommended. [592][,][593]

Routine CV monitoring includes ECG, automated non-invasive BP
measurement at regular intervals, and peripheral oxygen saturation
with pulse oximetry. Near-infrared spectroscopy has recently been
introduced to assess regional tissue perfusion and oxygenation. In selected cases, more invasive monitoring techniques can be applied

such as continuous arterial BP measurement via an arterial catheter

and monitoring of cardiac output. Mean arterial pressure and heart

ESC Guidelines 3891


rate remain stable, even with variation of up to 30% of total blood
volume. [594] Right heart catheterization can be used to continuously
measure central venous pressure and/or pulmonary artery pressure,
pulmonary artery wedge pressure (as a reflection of LV diastolic
pressure), and cardiac output. However, these are static variables
that do not reliably reflect the CV filling status, and have been shown
to accurately guide fluid therapy in 50% of patients. [595]

While routine use of pulmonary catheterization is discouraged
during NCS, using dynamic variables, such as stroke volume variation
or pulse pressure variation, has become the gold standard. In addition, TEE is increasingly being used as an intra-operative monitoring
technique in major surgery in cardiac compromised patients and during cardiac surgery. Decisions on the extent of peri-operative monitoring and implementation of specific strategies during NCS should
always be based on an individual patient-directed assessment, taking
into consideration the severity of surgery and the patient’s physical
condition. Basic peri-operative monitoring of the respiratory system
consists of pulse oximetry and capnography; both methods are noninvasive and easily applicable. Pulse oximetry enables in vivo measurement of arterial oxygen saturation, and capnometry measures endtidal carbon dioxide concentration during inspiration and expiration;
these monitors also provide information about the global haemodynamic status.
Patients, independent of the anaesthetic technique and information provided by the different monitoring systems, must be regularly
controlled. [596] In addition, blood loss and urine output should be
checked, when appropriate, and overall clinical status. [597] Special attention is required for the activation and setting of audible alarms,
as inadequate use or failure to respond to intra-operative alarms
may result in patient hazard and undesirable outcomes. [598]

7.2. Anaesthesia

The decision on the optimal peri-operative strategy should be based
on close exchange of clinical information between anaesthesiologists,
cardiologists, surgeons, and other relevant specialists. In addition, it is
mandatory that any proposed strategy is presented to and discussed
with the patient. An informed discussion with the patient describing
the planned patient pathway and expectations during the pre-, peri-,
and post-operative phases of care, and what to expect from staff and
surroundings, should be given using a clear, concise, and simple description. The ESA published Pre-operative evaluation of adults
undergoing elective noncardiac surgery: updated Guideline from
the European Society of Anaesthesiology in 2018. [560] This current
section focuses on issues that are specifically important to patients
with CV risk factors and diseases, taking into account the most recent developments in peri-operative management of these patients.

7.2.1. Intra-operative haemodynamics
Most anaesthetic techniques reduce sympathetic tone, leading to a
decrease in venous return due to increased compliance of the venous system, vasodilatation, and decreased BP. Therefore, maintenance of adequate organ flow and perfusion pressure is of key
importance in anaesthesiological management, especially in the
CV-compromised patient. The importance of keeping stable perioperative haemodynamics has been recognized for many years. [599]

In the past few years, several studies have focused on the relationship between intra-operative hypotension and post-operative


patient outcome. A recent systematic review identified 42 studies
looking at associations between various absolute and relative
intra-operative hypotension definitions and post-operative adverse
outcomes after NCS. [214] The reported associations suggest that organ injury (myocardial injury, stroke, AKI) might occur when the
mean arterial pressure decreases to,80 mmHg for ≥10 min, and
that this risk increases with BP becoming progressively lower.
However, most of the included studies had a retrospective observational design with a large variability in patient characteristics. In addition, the definitions of intra-operative hypotension varied widely
across included studies. A recent study on the incidence of
intra-operative hypotension as a function of the chosen cut-off definition described 48 different definitions of intra-operative hypotension. When applying these definitions to a cohort of 15 509
consecutive adult patients undergoing NCS under general anaesthesia, any episode of systolic BP,80 mmHg was found in 41% of the
patients, and 93% of the patients had at least one episode of systolic

BP .20% below baseline. The relation between threshold values

from the literature and incidence of intra-operative hypotension
showed a sigmoidal shaped cumulative incidence curve, with
intra-operative hypotension occurrence frequencies varying from
5–99%. [600] It seems that no universal target BP to define
intra-operative hypotension can currently be defined. In addition,
in studies on intra-operative hypotension, both the threshold to define hypotension and the method chosen to model intra-operative
hypotension affected the association of intra-operative hypotension
with outcome. [601] As a consequence, different studies on
intra-operative hypotension are uncomparable and clinical conclusions on reported results remain hazardous. A recent expert consensus statement concluded that intra-operative mean arterial
pressures,60–70 mmHg are associated with myocardial injury,
AKI, and death. These complications are a function of hypotension
severity and duration. [602] It remains to be established whether correction of intra-operative hypotension is also associated with improved
post-operative outcome. To date, only one study has specifically addressed the question of whether an individualized BP management
strategy reduces post-operative complications in a multicentre RCT
including 292 patients. An individualized management strategy of targeting a systolic BP within 10% of the patient’s normal resting value resulted in significantly lower rates of post-operative organ dysfunction
compared with standard practice (38.1% vs. 51.7%, respectively). [528]

These findings support the benefits of personalizing care, especially
in surgical patients at high-risk of cardiac complications. It is important
to underscore the importance of a physiopathological approach in understanding the underlying mechanisms of intra-operative hypotension, taking into account the extent and severity of the patient’s
comorbidities; only then will a tailored treatment targeting the cause
of intra-operative hypotension be possible (Figure 16).
The severity of intra-operative hypotension is defined both by the
threshold decrease from baseline and the duration of the hypotensive episode. The underlying mechanisms for intra-operative hypotension need to be identified: sympathicolysis with vasodilation,
hypovolaemia, or other more complex causes such as peri-operative
myocardial failure. Once the underlying mechanisms are identified, a
targeted therapeutic strategy can be applied. This includes considering
whether administration of specific chronic vasoactive medication such
as ACEIs or ARBs should be interrupted 24 h prior to surgery. [216]

3892 ESC Guidelines







Figure 16 Pathophysiological approach to address intra-operative hypotension. [a] E.g. peri-operative myocardial failure.


A detailed analysis of the strategies for the different chronic CV
medication is discussed in Section 5. Of note, post-operative outcome is not only negatively influenced by the occurrence of
intra-operative hypotension, but also by hypotensive events during
the initial four post-operative days. [603] For adult non-cardiac surgical patients, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a general
upper limit of arterial pressure at which therapy should be initiated, although pressures .160 mmHg have been associated
with myocardial injury and MI. [602]

Intra-operative tachycardia may adversely affect the myocardial oxygen balance and thus result in peri-operative myocardial
injury. A retrospective analysis of 41 140 patients found that a
heart rate ≥90 b.p.m. was associated with an increased risk of
myocardial injury. [604] These findings were similar to observations
in the Vascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery Patients Cohort
Evaluation (VISION) trial. [605] An analysis of high-risk surgical patients found that an HR .87 b.p.m., recorded at rest before
pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing, was strongly associated with distinct CV phenotypes, which may explain the unintended, adverse consequences of non-personalized treatments
aimed at reducing intra-operative tachycardia in isolation from other
haemodynamic factors. [606] Finally, a recent study evaluated the association between intra-operative tachycardia and a composite of
post-operative myocardial injury and all-cause mortality. The major
finding of this study was the lack of an association between
intra-operative heart rate .90 b.p.m. and the composite outcome;
HR .80 b.p.m. or .100 b.p.m. were also not associated with the
composite outcome. [607] Taken together, the assumed association
between intra-operative tachycardia and adverse peri-operative outcome remains a subject of ongoing controversy. However, it seems


advisable to consider intra-operative tachycardia as an indicator of
haemodynamic impairment.

7.2.2. Choice of anaesthetic agent
The choice of the anaesthetic agent has been considered to be of little importance in terms of patient outcome, provided that vital functions are adequately supported. Evidence from surgical myocardial

revascularization studies indicates that a volatile vs. i.v. anaesthetic

regimen is associated with less post-operative troponin release without impact on clinical outcomes. [599][,][608] A recent large multicentre
randomized trial found a neutral effect on 12 month mortality associated with volatile vs. i.v. anaesthetic regimen. [609] In NCS, incidence
of post-operative cardiac events is not influenced by the choice of a
volatile or an i.v. anaesthetic regimen. [610]

7.3. Locoregional techniques
The analgesic effects of neuraxial analgesia are well-established. The
main peri-operative indications for epidural analgesia include major
open abdominal surgery and thoracotomy. Possible additional benefits of epidural analgesia, such as accelerated recovery and decreased
post-operative complications, remain a matter of debate. [611][,][612]

Neuraxial analgesia may induce sympathetic blockade. When reaching the thoracic dermatome level 4, a reduction in cardiac sympathetic
drive may occur, with subsequent reduction in myocardial contractility, heart rate, and change in cardiac loading conditions. There are no
studies specifically investigating the changes in outcomes related to
neuraxial anaesthetic techniques in patients with cardiac disease.
Cardiac patients often take various types of drugs that interfere
with coagulation; therefore, care should be taken to ensure sufficient
coagulation ability when neuraxial blocks are applied. [613]

ESC Guidelines 3893


Current research is focusing on alternatives for neuraxial analgesia
with similar effects on peri-operative pain control in patients with
cardiac comorbidities undergoing NCS; these include alternative analgesic techniques such as i.v. analgesia, continuous wound infiltration, paravertebral bloc, and selective nerve blocks.

7.4. Peri-operative goal-directed
haemodynamic therapy
Goal-directed therapy aims to optimize CV performance, in order to
achieve normal or even supranormal oxygen delivery to tissues, by
optimizing pre-load and inotropic function using pre-defined haemodynamic targets. In contrast to clinical signs or arterial
pressure-orientated standard therapy, goal-directed therapy is based
on flow or fluid responsiveness of haemodynamic variables, such as
stroke volume, response to fluid challenges, stroke volume or pulse
pressure variation, or similar optimization of cardiac output.
Goal-directed therapy was initially based on the use of a pulmonary
artery catheter. Less-invasive techniques have recently been developed, including: transoesophageal Doppler, transpulmonary dilution
techniques, and advanced pressure waveform analysis. Early goaldirected fluid therapy—in the right patient cohort and with a clearly
defined protocol—has been shown to decrease post-operative mortality and morbidity. [614][–][618]

7.5. Post-operative management
Several studies have demonstrated that it is possible to stratify the
risk of post-operative complications and mortality with a simple surgical Apgar score. This post-event stratification might enable patients
to be redirected to higher-intensity care units. The importance of
such risk stratification is underscored by the results of the EuSOS
group. In this 7 day cohort study, 46 539 consecutive adult NCS patients in 498 hospitals across 28 European nations were included:
1855 patients (4%) died before hospital discharge and 1358 (73%)
of those patients were not admitted to critical care at any stage after
surgery. [7] This concept of failure-to-rescue has gained a lot of attention in peri-operative medicine in the last few years and strategies
have been proposed to address this issue. [619][–][622]

–
Severe post-operative pain occurs in 5 10% of patients, increases
sympathetic drive, and delays recovery. [623][,][624] A recent study demonstrated that time-weighted average pain scores within 72 h after surgery were significantly associated with myocardial injury in patients
undergoing NCS; [625] this finding underscores the importance of effective post-operative analgesia to reduce post-operative CV risk.
The place of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in
the treatment of post-operative pain in cardiac patients undergoing
NCS is a point of debate. Diclofenac has been shown to carry the
highest CV risk of any of the non-selective NSAIDs. [626][,][627] The CV
risk of ibuprofen seems to be comparable with that of celecoxib. [628]

Naproxen has a better CV safety profile than diclofenac and ibuprofen. [629][,][630] One randomized trial found that parecoxib and valdecoxib
did not increase thromboembolic events in patients undergoing
NCS. A meta-analysis of 32 randomized trials did not find an increased CV risk when comparing parecoxib/valdecoxib with placebo, [631] and a single-centre observational study with .10 000
patients undergoing arthroplasty found no association between


NSAID use and post-operative MI. [632] In contrast, another
meta-analysis of three randomized trials including 2604 major surgery patients detected a 2.3-fold increase in MACEs in the group
with COX-2 inhibitors. In a position paper, The ESC Working
Group on Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy advises that non-aspirin
NSAIDs should generally not be used in patients with established or
at high risk of CVD. [633]

### 8. Peri-operative cardiovascular complications

Specific challenges apply to detecting CV complications that occur
peri-operatively. First, due to anaesthesia and analgesia, PMI, which
is the most common CV complication, is largely asymptomatic in
≏90% of patients and is therefore missed in routine clinical practice in the absence of surveillance for PMI. [41][,][101][,][111][,][413][,][636][–][641]

Second, post-operative pain, nausea, surgical wounds, and drains
may interfere with the early identification of acute cardiac disorders, such as PMI, Takotsubo syndrome, tachyarrhythmias, and
acute HF. Third, cardiologists are usually not directly involved in
post-operative care; therefore, the early detection and early treatment of cardiac complications is performed by non-cardiologists,
sometimes with little training in the early detection of acute cardiac disorders. Given the relatively high prevalence of cardiac complications, their high morbidity and mortality, and the availability of
effective therapy, high awareness combined with surveillance for
PMI in high-risk patients (known CAD, PAD, insulin-dependent
DM, or symptoms suggestive of cardiac disorders) undergoing
intermediate- or high-risk NCS is recommended to overcome

these challenges. [41][,][101][,][109][–][111][,][118][,][413][,][636][–][639][,][642][,][643] All measures
need to be carefully aligned with the responsible surgeon.
Chronic cardiac disorders, such as CAD, seem to provide a substrate for cardiac complications during and after surgery. [41][,][413][,][636][,][637]

                                         Several related chronic conditions (e.g. diabetes and renal insuffi
ciency), which are likely to be surrogates for undiagnosed cardiac disease, are also strongly associated with peri-operative cardiac
complications (Figure 17). [41][,][413][,][636][,][637]

Acute conditions such as trauma, surgery, and anaesthesia itself induce activation of the sympathetic nervous system, inflammation,
stress, hypercoagulable, and catabolic states, all of which may trigger
cardiac complications. [41][,][413][,][636][,][637] While the risk of CV complications after NCS is highest in the immediate peri-operative period,
it seems to remain increased for a prolonged ‘vulnerable period’ of
3–5 months. [8]

8.1. Peri-operative myocardial
infarction/injury
Peri-operative MI (PMI) is defined as acute cardiomyocyte injury
(post-operative hs-cTn T/I release) with or without accompanying
symptoms, and with or without ECG or imaging evidence of acute
myocardial ischaemia. Peri-operative MI can only be reliably and


rapidly detected using PMI surveillance with hs-cTn T/I measurements before and serially after surgery (e.g. 24 and 48 h postoperatively). In the BASEL-PMI study, circa 15% of patients with
pre-existing CAD/PAD or aged .65 years undergoing major NCS
developed PMI. [8] As most PMI occurs during the operation itself or
in the immediate post-operative period, during which high doses
of anaesthetics and/or analgesics are required, ≏90% of patients
with PMI do not report typical symptoms and are therefore
missed in routine clinical practice. [41][,][101][,][111][,][413][,][636][–][639] This is of major
concern, as the mortality risk associated with PMI is also high in
patients without symptoms. [41][,][101][,][111][,][413][,][636][–][639] Similarly, the
mortality risk associated with PMI is high in patients without additional ECG and/or imaging evidence of myocardial ischaemia. [8][,][41][,][101][,][109][–][111][,][118][,][413][,][564][,][636][–][639][,][641] Overall, 30 day mortality in
patients developing PMI is ≏10%. [8][,][41][,][101][,][109][–][111][,][118][,][413][,][564][,][636][–][639][,][641]

No single intervention has yet been proven to be unequivocally
beneficial in the prevention of PMI. [185][,][644]

It is important to highlight that PMI is not a homogenous disease.
Several different pathophysiologies and clinical phenotypes may
underlie PMI (Figure 18). At least one additional criterion (ischaemic
pain; ischaemic ECG changes; imaging evidence of new loss of viable
myocardium, or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern
consistent with an ischaemic aetiology; and thrombus in coronary

angiography) is required for patients with PMI to also meet the definition of peri-operative myocardial infarction, according to the
fourth universal definition. [643] Because is often initially unclear
whether the patient will end up fulfilling the criteria for perioperative myocardial infarction, the broad term PMI is preferred in
the initial assessment. In order to properly interpret the aetiology
of elevated post-operative hs-cTn T/I concentrations, a baseline preoperative concentration is necessary to determine whether the increase is acute or chronic (see Section 4). [643] To identify the underlying pathophysiology and define causal therapy, systematic
work-up and early differentiation of primarily non-cardiac causes

—
(e.g. severe sepsis, PE) vs. the different cardiac causes including

—
type-1 MI, type-2 MI, tachyarrhythmia, and acute HF is of major importance (Figures 18 and 19). Transthoracic echocardiography is
helpful in the work-up of most patients with PMI.
The term myocardial injury following NCS (MINS) has been used
for a selected subset of patients with cardiac PMI, in whom cardiomyocyte injury was deemed most likely due to CAD with myocardial


ischaemia (i.e. secondary to supply–demand mismatch or thrombosis), in the absence of an atypical surgical physiological stress,
and no evidence of a cardiac non-CAD aetiology, e.g. rapid AF, acute
HF). [101][,][109][,][638][,][641][,][642][,][645][,][646] In approximately half of all patients with
PMI, the underlying pathophysiology cannot be reliably ascertained
based on the commonly available documentation and is assumed
to be likely type-2 MI due to undocumented or relative hypotension,
but may also include missed type-1 MI, or missed PE in cases in which
CT angiography has not yet been performed post-operatively. [110][,][647]

It is therefore important to highlight that PMI surveillance also facilitates the detection of primarily non-cardiac disorders with immediate therapeutic consequences, such as PE, that would otherwise have

been missed.

The prevalence of PMI depends on patient-related, proceduralrelated, and post-operative factors, and the required minimum extent
of acute myocardial injury, quantified by absolute increase in
hs-cTn T/I (e.g. the 99 [th] percentile ULN) above the pre-operative
hs-cTn T/I concentration. [8][,][41][,][101][,][109][–][111][,][118][,][413][,][564][,][636][–][639][,][641][,][648]

An absolute increase in more than the ULN above pre-operative
concentrations has consistently been shown to be associated with
a relevant increase in 30 day and long-term mortality, and other nonfatal post-operative cardiac complications, and can easily be
determined for each hs-cTn T/I assay. This threshold is therefore
recommended for clinical use. [8][,][41][,][101][,][109][–][111][,][118][,][413][,][564][,][636][–][639][,][641][,][648]

However, further studies are warranted regarding optimal thresholds. Emerging data suggest that surveillance for PMI is
cost-effective. [117][,][119]

Identification of the most likely pathophysiology is critical for selection of the most appropriate therapy. Evidence from a large singlecentre retrospective cohort suggests that involvement of a cardiologist in the work-up and therapy of these patients was associated with


lower mortality. [649] Mortality substantially differs among the different
phenotypes: 30 day all-cause mortality and the composite of 30 day
CV death, life-threatening arrhythmia, acute MI occurring after day 3,
and cardiac decompensation are highest in patients with acute HF
and primarily extra-cardiac PMI, such as severe sepsis or PE, intermediate for type-1 MI and tachyarrhythmias, and modestly elevated
in likely type-2 MI. [110] Type-2 MI patients are usually treated as for
type-1 MI, although the evidence for this is limited.
In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 1754 patients (mean age
70 years) who had developed MINS after NCS (mainly orthopaedic,
general, and vascular surgery) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive dabigatran 110 mg orally b.i.d. or matched placebo within 35
days of MINS; [650] 60% of patients were already on aspirin or a

ESC Guidelines 3897


P2Y 12 inhibitor. The median peak measured hs-cTn concentration
associated with the diagnosis of MINS was 82 ng/L. More than
90% of MINS events occurred without a clinical symptom or sign
of cardiac ischaemia. Dabigatran/placebo was initiated a median of
6 days after the operation and the average time on study drug was
≏9 months. Among patients with MINS randomly assigned to receive dabigatran (n = 877) or placebo (n = 877), the composite pri

vascular mortality, MI, non-haemorrhagic stroke, peripheral arterial

to placebo; HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55–0.93; P = 0.0115). There was
no increase in major bleeding. Based on these data, in patients with
MINS and at low risk of bleeding, initiation of dabigatran 110 mg orally b.i.d. may be considered about 1 week after NCS.

about 0.5% within 30 days, and 1 2% within 365 days for patients undergoing major NCS with established CAD, PAD, or aged .65 years. [8]

In the immediate post-operative period (,5 days), bleeding is a major concern and limits the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, depending on the site and extent of surgery. Otherwise, the
same principles as for MI therapy should generally be applied following the recommendations of speciality guidelines. [98][,][171]

8.3. Takotsubo syndrome
The incidence of peri-operative Takotsubo syndrome remains unknown, as none of the studies with PMI screening used echocardiography in all patients during PMI work-up. Increased awareness in the
non-operative setting has led to a substantial increase in the detection of Takotsubo syndrome, and the use of TTE in the work-up
of PMI is strongly encouraged. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it
is likely that the incidence is also higher than expected in the perioperative setting. [8][,][41][,][101][,][109][–][111][,][118][,][413][,][564][,][636][–][639][,][641][,][644]

8.4. Acute heart failure

The incidence of post-operative acute HF seems to be 1–2% within

–
30 days and 4 6% within 365 days in patients with established CAD,
PAD, or aged .65 years undergoing major NCS. [8] Pre-existing diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic HF and volume loading in the perioperative and post-operative periods are important contributors.
In the absence of studies specifically investigating acute HF postoperatively, the general principles of acute HF diagnostic work-up
and therapy should be applied. [651]

8.5. Venous thromboembolism

The incidence of VTE in the peri-operative phase is currently unknown and likely underreported due to the lack of systematic
screening methods and the limited validity of diagnostic tools (e.g.
D-dimer, typical pain symptoms) in this setting. It is associated
with high peri-operative mortality (≏17%). [322] Risk factors for postoperative VTE/PE include type of surgery (e.g. high-risk hip arthroplasty, open prostatectomy, open surgery for malignancy), acute


renal insufficiency, MI, and post-operative infection. [322]

Stratification of the extent of embolism (e.g. massive, submassive,
and subsegmental; high risk, intermediate high/low risk, and low
risk) is important to predict mortality and guide therapeutic strategy. [652] Pulmonary embolism should be suspected in patients with
PMI without a clear cause. Close haemodynamic monitoring and
monitoring of RV function (echocardiography, CT) is essential to determine which PE patients require aggressive therapy. There is currently a lack of evidence regarding adequate antithrombotic therapy
in patients with post-operative PE, since recent major surgery or
trauma was a contraindication in previous trials of thrombolytic or
anticoagulant therapy. [653] Small case series support the use of systemic thrombolysis, surgical thrombectomy, [654] or catheter-directed
therapies in massive PE. In general, anticoagulation, preferably
LMWH or fondaparinux, should be initiated as early as possible. [652]

Oral anticoalgulant therapy, preferably NOAC due to the lower
bleeding risk, should be initiated, depending on post-operative renal
function and bleeding risk, as early as possible for at least 3
months. [652]

Rescue thrombolytic therapy is recommended for patients with
PE and haemodynamic deterioration on anticoagulation treatment
in the post-operative phase, if possible, according to bleeding
risk. [652] As an alternative to thrombolytic therapy for massive PE, surgical embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed treatment
should be considered for patients with haemodynamic deterioration
on anticoagulation treatment, particularly in patients with high bleeding risk.

8.6. Atrial fibrillation and other relevant
arrhythmias
Post-operative AF is defined as new-onset AF in the immediate post
–
operative period; its incidence ranges between 2 30%, with peak incidence 2–4 days post-operatively. [655][,][656]

–
Although many post-operative AF episodes are self terminating
and some are asymptomatic, post-operative AF has been associated
with a four- to five-fold risk of AF recurrence in the 5 years following
cardiac surgery, while the risk of recurrence after NCS is less well described. [656][–][660] Importantly, post-operative AF is a risk factor for
stroke, MI, and death compared with non-post-operative AF patients. [656][,][658][,][661] Post-operative AF may also lead to haemodynamic
instability, prolonged hospital stay, infections, renal complications,
bleeding, increased in-hospital death, and greater healthcare
costs. [662][–][664] The essential principles of the prevention and management of post-operative AF are outlined in Figure 20.

8.6.1. Prevention of post-operative atrial
fibrillation
Pre-operative use of beta-blockers is associated with reduced incidence of post-operative AF, [204][,][665][–][667] but not major adverse
events such as death, stroke, or AKI. [668] Importantly, in a large
RCT, peri-operative metoprolol was associated with increased
mortality risk. [185] In a meta-analysis, amiodarone (oral or i.v.)
was equally effective in reducing post-operative AF as betablockers, [207] whereas their combination was better than betablockers alone. [208] Lower cumulative doses of amiodarone
(,3000 mg) may be effective, with fewer adverse events. [669][–][671]

Management of Atrial Fibrillation. [99]


Data for other interventions—such as statins, [672][,][673] magnesium, [674]

sotalol, [666] colchicine, [675] or corticosteroids [676] —are not robust. [677][,][678]

8.6.2. Management of post-operative atrial
fibrillation
8.6.2.1. Rate and/or rhythm control
In haemodynamically unstable patients with post-operative AF, an
emergent electrical or possibly pharmacological (i.e. i.v. administration of amiodarone [666] or vernakalant, [679] if consistent with the clinical
situation) cardioversion is indicated. [99] In haemodynamically stable


patients with post-operative AF, ensuring optimal ventricular rate
control during the arrhythmia is mandatory (using, for example betablockers or verapamil, as needed). As post-operative AF is often self
–
terminating, non emergent cardioversion may not be needed. If
performed in patients with AF lasting ≥48 h, non-emergency cardioversion of post-operative AF should follow the principles of pericardioversion thromboprophylaxis (that is, can be performed only
after the left atrial thrombosis is excluded by TEE or postponed
for 3 weeks of therapeutic OAC therapy). Of note, a RCT of patients
with post-operative AF after cardiac surgery showed no net clinical

ESC Guidelines 3899


advantage of rhythm (i.e. achieving and maintenance of sinus rhythm)
vs. rate control strategy. [680] Therefore, rate or rhythm control treatment decisions in patients with haemodynamically stable postoperative AF should be based on patient’s symptoms and shared informed treatment decision-making. [99]

8.6.2.2. Prevention of atrial fibrillation-related thromboembolic
complications
In all patients with post-operative AF, it should be considered to initiate therapeutic anticoagulation as soon as possible during inhospital treatment, depending on the individual stroke risk
(CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc) and the bleeding risk after surgery. In a large
meta-analysis, patients with post-operative AF had 62% higher risk
of early stroke and 37% higher risk of long-term stroke compared
with patients without post-operative AF (long-term stroke rates
were 2.4% in post-operative AF vs. 0.4% in patients without AF),
and a 44% and 37% higher risk of early and long-term mortality, respectively. [661] Importantly, post-operative AF was more strongly associated with the long-term stroke risk in patients undergoing NCS

–
(HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.70 2.35) than in patients undergoing cardiac
surgery (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07–1.34; P, 0.0001). [661]

Evidence on the effects of long-term OAC therapy for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in patients with postoperative AF is from observational studies. [664][,][681][–][685] In a recent
study, post-operative AF following NCS was associated with similar long-term thromboembolic risk as common, non-surgical AF,
and OAC use was associated with comparable lower risk of
thromboembolism and all–cause mortality in both groups (mean
CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc-score 3.0 + 1.7). [686]

Based on the available evidence, long-term OAC should be considered in all patients with post-operative AF at risk of stroke. If anticoagulation is parenterally initiated, LMWH or fondaparinux is
recommended (over UFH) for most patients. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants should be preferred over VKA for longterm treatment. Re-evaluation of the continuation of OAC may be
performed after a period of 3 months. A small RCT (ASPIRE-AF;
NCT03968393) on the optimal long-term OAC use among NCS patients developing post-operative AF is ongoing.

8.7. Peri-operative stroke
With respect to NCS, peri-operative stroke has been reported in
0.08–0.70% of patients undergoing general surgery, 0.2–0.9% of pa
–
tients requiring orthopaedic surgery, 0.6 0.9% of lung operations,
and 0.8–3.0% of surgeries involving the peripheral vasculature. [687][,][688]

The associated mortality ranges from 18–26%. [687][,][688] A more recent
analysis of 523 059 patients undergoing NCS reported a lower incidence of peri-operative stroke (0.1%), although the occurrence of
this adverse event was associated with an eight-fold increase in perioperative mortality within 30 days, corresponding to an absolute risk
increase of .20%. [689] Peri-operative stroke is mainly ischaemic or
cardioembolic, and AF is often the leading underlying condition.
Triggers include withdrawal of anticoagulation and the hypercoagulable state related to surgery. Additional aetiologies include atheroembolism, originating from the aorta or the supra-aortic vessels,
and local atherothrombosis in the presence of intracranial small ves
—
sel disease. Hypoperfusion related to peri-operative arterial


—
hypotension and/or severe stenosis of the cervicocranial vessels
is an unusual cause of peri-operative stroke. [690] Rarely, peri-operative
stroke may be due to air, fat, or paradoxical embolisms.
In an attempt to attenuate the risk of peri-operative stroke, antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatments should be continued whenever
possible throughout the peri-operative period. Alternatively, the
period of drug withdrawal should be kept as short as possible, while
weighting thromboembolic and haemorrhagic risks (see Section 5.2).
Adequate selection of the anaesthetic technique (regional vs. neuraxial vs. general anaesthesia), prevention and treatment of AF, euglycaemic control (avoiding both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia), and
meticulous peri-operative control of BP may all contribute to reducing the risk of peri-operative stroke.
If post-operative stroke occurs, it must trigger immediate action:
angio-CT and neurology/neurosurgical consultation with the goal
to restore flow in the case of acute thrombotic occlusion.

### 9. Key messages

- The occurrence of CV complications in the peri-operative phase
of NCS has a dramatic impact on prognosis.

- The risk of CV complications in patients undergoing NCS is determined by patient-related factors, type of surgery or procedure, and
the circumstances under which surgery takes place (elective vs. emergency procedure; local or tertiary hospital).

Specific patient-related risk factors may be reduced by adequate
pre-operative risk assessment and initiation of effective risk-reduction

strategies.

The quantification of surgical risk as low, intermediate, and high is
helpful in identifying the group of patients who should most benefit
from preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches to con
comitant CV conditions.

- Proper selection of type and timing of the surgical procedure may
reduce the risk of complications.

- It is important that patients’ values, quality of life, and preferences
regarding the benefits and risks of surgery are taken into consideration, and that well-informed patients are involved in the decisions.
Risk should be communicated to the patient in absolute terms (e.g.
1 out of 100).

- Clinical examination, patient-reported functional capacity, and
non-invasive tests represent the cornerstone of pre-operative car
diac assessment.

- Instrumental and functional cardiac examination tools should be

selected in view of the surgical risk, relative diagnostic proficiency,

and healthcare resource utilization and costs.

- The peri-operative evaluation of elderly patients who require
elective major NCS should include frailty screening, which has proven to be an excellent predictor of unfavourable health outcomes
in the older surgical population.

- Treatment of pre-existing or newly diagnosed CV conditions (e.g.
coronary and peripheral vascular disease, rhythm disorders, and
HF) should be individualized according to the pre-operative risk
of NCS, and considering the recommendations of speciality
guidelines.

- A multidisciplinary approach to evaluate whether the treatment

of concomitant cardiac conditions before scheduled NCS im
proves peri-operative safety without unnecessary delay is
encouraged.

- Efficient peri-operative management of antithrombotic therapies
in patients scheduled for NCS aims to offer the potential benefit
of preventing thrombotic events without excessive bleeding
complications.



- It is important to clearly and concisely communicate with patients,
with simple verbal and written instructions, about changes in medication in the pre- and post-operative phases.

- Management in the peri-operative phase of NCS aims to avoid
haemodynamic imbalance, while ensuring sufficient cardioprotec
tive action.

- Healthcare providers are recommended to have high awareness of
peri-operative CV complications combined with surveillance for
PMI in high-risk patients undergoing intermediate- or high-risk

NCS.

- Routine assessment of treatment quality through specific indicators is important to document and measure the success of preventive and therapeutic strategies in patients undergoing NCS.
### 10. Gaps in evidence

- The age cut-off for individuals (considered to be cardiovascularly
healthy) benefiting from risk stratification work-out before NCS

needs to be evaluated.

- Further studies are needed to characterize outcome differences in

NCS between men and women, and between different countries,

in order to individualize peri-operative management and improve
patient safety.

- Evidence on the additive value of cardiac biomarkers, hand-held

ultrasound, problem FOCUS, and stress echocardiography for cardiac risk stratification of patients scheduled for NCS presenting
with previously unknown cardiac murmur, dyspnoea, oedema,
and chest pain is still lacking. The impact of FOCUS on outcomes
of urgent or time-sensitive surgery needs further investigation.

- The impact of stress imaging (echocardiography or MRI) before
NCS on reduction of peri-operative CV complications in non
ischaemic heart diseases needs further research.

- The role of right heart catheterization in patients with advanced
HF or patients with severe pulmonary hypertension undergoing

NCS is unknown.

- It is unknown whether artificial intelligence-based systems facilitate
prompt detection and response to imminent adverse events in
high-risk cardiac patients undergoing high-risk NCS.

- Systematic and structured research to investigate pathophysiology, causes, and time distribution of serious peri-operative arrhythmic events among patients undergoing NCS is still needed.

- Strategies for timing of pre-operative CIED control dependent on
device type, urgency, and type of NCS, and risk of EMI during NCS
need to be developed to ensure maximal patient safety.

- Benefit of routine myocardial revascularization of high-risk CCS
patients (except left main or three-vessel CAD, reduced LV function) before elective intermediate- and high-risk NCS is not

well-established.

- More evidence regarding the need for bridging of anticoagulation
in patients with MHVs is needed.

- There is a lack of evidence regarding the optimal strategies before
emergent or time-sensitive NCS for patients on antithrombotic
treatment at high risk of thromboembolic events, including the:
(i) use of extracorporeal haemoperfusion or NOAC antidotes
(ongoing trial NCT04233073); (ii) use of albumin, extracorporeal
haemoperfusion, or PB2452-specific antidote to antagonized ticagrelor (ongoing trial NCT04286438 for PB2452); and (iii)

ESC Guidelines 3901


premature cessation or bridging during interruption of oral
P2Y12-receptor inhibitors (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors
or cangrelor).

- There is lack of well-powered studies to evaluate the role of platelet function testing to guide the strategy for treatment of NCS patients on antiplatelet therapy.

Evidence regarding the need for and benefit of anticoagulation in
NCS patients with post-operative AF is still lacking (ongoing
ASPIRE-AF trial: NCT03968393).

- Prophylactic strategies to reduce the incidence of post-operative
AF in NCS patients additional to beta-blocker maintenance in patients already on this treatment need to be evaluated.

- The optimal cardiac work-up and therapy for patients with PMI
within and outside hospital settings need to be evaluated.

- Studies are needed to investigate the impact of the treatment of
peri-operative hypotension on post-operative outcomes, the use
of new HF drug classes (SGLT2 inhibitors and vericiguat), and
the use of NSAIDs as a temporary treatment for acute post
operative pain.

- Prospective studies are needed to investigate the incremental value
of anaemia algorithms and blood-sparing strategies (use of bloodsparing blood tubes) to reduce the risk of anaemia-associated adverse outcomes among CV patients undergoing NCS.
### 11. Sex differences

Sex and gender may significantly affect the management and outcomes of patients with specific diseases undergoing NCS. There
are sex- and gender-dependent clinical phenotypes of comorbidities
and risk factors, which may have an impact on peri-operative morbidity and mortality. However, there is a paucity of data specifically
addressing the interplay between sex, age, and comorbidities in pa
tients scheduled for NCS.

The pre-operative assessment before NCS might take sex into
consideration, since the age-adjusted incidence of CVD is lower in


women than men, and the risk of undetected disease could therefore
be lower in women. However, no data exist on sex-specific assess
ment strategies.
The in-hospital mortality during surgery was recently reported to
be lower in women than men. [41][,][691] In contrast, among 609 735 pa
tients who underwent elective NCS between 2009 and 2016, the

odds of post-operative 90 day mortality were higher among women
with HF than men with HF. [692] Further studies are needed to provide

more information about outcome differences between men and wo
men in NCS.

Some studies have reported a higher risk of bleeding in women
than men, but other studies could not confirm this. No trials have
systematically investigated the impact of sex differences regarding efficacy and safety of continuation vs. interruption of antithrombotic
therapy in patients undergoing NCS.
The prevalence of anaemia in women of reproductive age is as high
as 30% (WHO Global Anaemia estimates), [693] resulting in millions of
women undergoing surgery every year despite pre-operative anaemia.

Furthermore, since women have lower blood volumes and lower

haemoglobin values than men, but face the same surgical blood loss
as men, they are exposed to far higher risk of post-operative complications. Also, higher transfusion rates and volumes have been reported in women compared with men in elective surgery. [694] It is
therefore of particular importance that clinicians follow the Patient
Blood Management program in women undergoing NCS. Other sexrelated differences in physiology, and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anaesthetic drugs may influence the anaesthesia plan,
pain management, post-operative recovery, and patient satisfaction.
Sex differences regarding presentation, electrophysiological substrate, complications, or long-term outcomes have been reported
in patients undergoing CIED implantation, [695][,][696] and female sex is
a well-known risk factor for stroke in patients with AF. [697]

However, no specific data exist that suggest sex differences in risk
profile or outcomes of patients with CIEDs or arrhythmias who
undergo NCS.

### 13. Quality indicators

Quality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care
quality, including structural, process, and outcomes of care. [698] They
may also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to guideline
recommendations, through associated quality improvement initiatives and the benchmarking of care providers. [699][,][700] As such, the
role of QIs in improving care and outcomes for CV disease is increasingly being recognized by healthcare authorities, professional organizations, payers, and the public. [698]

The ESC understands the need for measuring and reporting quality

and outcomes of CV care and has established methods for the devel
opment of the ESC QIs for the quantification of care and outcomes for
CV diseases. [698] To date, the ESC has developed QI suites for a number
of CV diseases [701][–][703] and embedded these in respective ESC Clinical
Practice Guidelines (2020 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation; 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis
and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure; and 2021 ESC

Guidelines on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy). [99][,][412][,][481][,][704] Furthermore, the ESC aims to integrate its QIs with
clinical registries such as the EURObservational Research Programme
(EORP) and the European Unified Registries On Heart Care


Evaluation and Randomized Trials (EuroHeart) project [705] to provide
‘real-world’ data about the patterns and outcomes of care for CV disease across Europe.
In parallel with the writing of this Clinical Practice Guideline document, a process has been initiated to develop QIs for patients undergoing NCS using the ESC methodology and through collaboration
with patient representatives and domain experts. Such QIs may be
used for evaluation of the quality of care for this group of patients
and enable capture of important aspects of care delivery. The QIs,
alongside their measurement specifications and development process, will be published in a separate paper.
### 14. Central illustration


There is a complex interplay between the intrinsic risk of surgery and
the patient-related risk of peri-operative CV complications. This latter risk depends on the baseline general and CV status of patients
scheduled for NCS. For each patient, the proper quantification and
communication of the surgical risk require close cooperation between cardiologists, surgeons, anaesthesiologists, general practitioners, and other healthcare providers (Figure 21).

complications.
