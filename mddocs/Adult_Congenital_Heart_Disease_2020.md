#### 1 Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management
strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines
and their recommendations should facilitate decision making of
health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and

caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other societies and organizations. Because of their impact on clinical practice,
quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be
[found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.

In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the
ESC carries out the EurObservational Research Programme of international registries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions which
are essential to assess, diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of
resources and adherence to Guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and
around the world, based on high-quality data collected during routine
clinical practice.
Furthermore, the ESC has developed and embedded in this document a set of quality indicators (QIs), which are tools to evaluate the
level of implementation of the Guidelines and may be used by the
ESC, hospitals, healthcare providers and professionals to measure
clinical practice as well as used in educational programmes, alongside
the key messages from the guidelines, to improve quality of care and

clinical outcomes.

The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in
order to represent professionals involved with the medical care of

ESC Guidelines 569

patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a
comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of
a given condition according to ESC Committee for Practice
Guidelines (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the
risk�benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and
graded according to predefined scales, as outlined below.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of


[rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[guidelines). This process ensures transparency and prevents potential](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
biases in the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of interest that arise during the writing period were notified
to the ESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial
support from the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare
industry.

The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
Guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement
process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive
review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions
the Guidelines are approved by all the experts involved in the Task

570 ESC Guidelines


Force. The finalized document is approved by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The Guidelines were developed
after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge
and the evidence available at the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation
of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary
slides, booklets with essential messages, summary cards for nonspecialists and an electronic version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus, for more
detailed information, the user should always access to the full text
version of the Guidelines, which is freely available via the ESC website
and hosted on the EHJ website. The National Cardiac Societies of the
ESC are encouraged to endorse, adopt, translate and implement all
ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed because it
has been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in
the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic
or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines do
not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of
health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in
consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation
with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or
necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify
the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.
#### 2 Introduction

2.1 Why do we need new Guidelines on
the management of adult congenital
heart disease?

Since the previous version of the Guidelines on the management of
grown-up congenital heart disease (CHD) was published in 2010,
new evidence has accumulated for this patient group, particularly on
percutaneous interventional techniques and risk stratification with
regard to timing of surgery and catheter intervention, as well as medi
cal treatment. This made a revision of the recommendations

necessary.
Since adult patients with CHD now present in increasing numbers
at advanced ages, including the elderly, the term grown-up CHD no
longer appears appropriate and was therefore replaced with adult
CHD (ACHD) throughout the document. This is also in accordance

with international literature.

2.2 Content of these Guidelines

Decision making in ACHD involves accurate diagnosis, timing of
intervention, risk assessment, and selection of the most suitable type
of intervention. In addition, specific aspects of medical treatment for
conditions such as heart failure, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and
anticoagulation are addressed.
These guidelines focus on ACHD, are oriented towards manage


disease, and aortic disease, refer to the relevant separate guideline
documents published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

2.3 New format of the Guidelines

The new Guidelines have been adapted to facilitate their use in clinical practice and to meet the readers’ demands by focusing on condensed, clearly presented recommendations. At the end of the
document, section 5 proposes topics for future research and section 6
summarizes the key messages. For more background information
please refer to the ESC Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine. [1]

2.4 How to use these Guidelines

The Committee emphasizes that many factors ultimately determine
the most appropriate treatment in individual patients within a given
community. These factors include availability of diagnostic equipment, the expertise of cardiologists and surgeons, especially in the
field of congenital heart surgery and percutaneous intervention, and
notably, the wishes of well-informed patients. Furthermore, owing to

the lack of evidence-based data in the field of ACHD, most recom
mendations are largely the result of expert consensus based on retrospective and prospective observational studies and registries.
Therefore, deviations from these Guidelines may be appropriate in

certain clinical circumstances.

2.5 What is new in the 2020 Guidelines?

Selected revised recommendations, new recommendations, and new

concepts are summarized in Table 3.
#### 3 General aspects

3.1 Prevalence of adult congenital heart
disease

To date, the prevalence of CHD worldwide is �9 per 1000 newborns, with substantial geographic variation. [2][,][3] While the prevalence
of severe congenital heart defects is declining in many Western/
developed countries due to foetal screening and pregnancy termination, overall prevalence on a global scale is increasing. [4] Due to medical, surgical, and technological evolutions over the past decades,

>90% of individuals with CHD who are born, now survive into adulthood. [5] As a result, the prevalence of CHD in the community has
increased and now by far exceeds the number of children with
CHD. [6] CHD can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe (see
Table 4).

3.2 Organization of care
When patients with CHD are approaching adulthood, they require
transfer to ACHD care. This transfer should be preceded by a preparatory transition phase, which continues into adulthood according
to the needs of the patient. Special healthcare organization and training programmes are required to meet the needs of this patient population. [7] Importantly, the care for ACHD patients is a lifelong process
(Figure 1) and also requires advance care planning strategies. The ESC
Working Group on Grown-up Congenital Heart Disease published a
position paper on recommendations for organization of care and
training in the subspecialty of ACHD in Europe. [8] The position paper

2.1 Why do we need new Guidelines on
the management of adult congenital
heart disease?

Since the previous version of the Guidelines on the management of
grown-up congenital heart disease (CHD) was published in 2010,
new evidence has accumulated for this patient group, particularly on
percutaneous interventional techniques and risk stratification with
regard to timing of surgery and catheter intervention, as well as medi
cal treatment. This made a revision of the recommendations

necessary.
Since adult patients with CHD now present in increasing numbers
at advanced ages, including the elderly, the term grown-up CHD no
longer appears appropriate and was therefore replaced with adult
CHD (ACHD) throughout the document. This is also in accordance

with international literature.


2.2 Content of these Guidelines

Decision making in ACHD involves accurate diagnosis, timing of
intervention, risk assessment, and selection of the most suitable type
of intervention. In addition, specific aspects of medical treatment for
conditions such as heart failure, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and
anticoagulation are addressed.
These guidelines focus on ACHD, are oriented towards management, and for more details in the topics of endocarditis, isolated valve

three levels: (i) patients who require care exclusively in a specialist
centre, (ii) patients for whom shared care can be established with the
appropriate general adult cardiac services, and (iii) patients who can be
managed in non-specialist clinics (with access to specialized care if
required). The proposed staff requirements for specialist centres are
described in Table 5. The complexity of the heart defect should not be
the only criterion to assign patients to a certain level of care. Although
patients with complex defects can easily be assigned to a high level of
care, even anatomically simple defects may require specialist care
under certain circumstances [e.g. atrial septal defect (ASD) with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)]. Therefore, it is recommended
that all ACHD patients are seen once in a specialist centre, allowing
ACHD specialists to determine the most appropriate level of care and
follow-up intervals for each individual patient. [8] Networks of specialist
centres with general adult care should be established for each catchment area. Indeed, with the growing population of adults with CHD,
more patients will first present to general cardiologists for acute conditions, such as arrhythmia, heart failure, or endocarditis. In such cases,


unstable patients but ought to liaise with the patient’s ACHD centre
immediately to discuss appropriate management strategies or transfer
of the patient. Special attention is necessary for patients after Fontan
correction presenting with arrhythmia, as even supraventricular
arrhythmias are not well tolerated. Detailed advice on emergency care
for ACHD patients will follow in a separate future position paper.

Transfer of adolescents to ACHD care is vital as they approach
adulthood without gaps in care, and should be preceded by a preparatory transition phase with additional transition support that continues into early adulthood according to the needs of the patient. [10]

Transition requires a special healthcare organization. [10][,][11] It is recommended that specialist ACHD centres have teams including specialist
nurses, psychologists, and social workers given that anxiety, depression, or problems coping with the medical condition are well known
concerns in adult patients with CHD. [12] They also play a critical role
in the transition process by taking over the transitional care of
patients after the transfer from paediatric cardiology. Aspects that
have to be addressed by allied health professionals include mental
health, psychic well-being, and quality of life. [12][,][13] During the ACHD

care journey, advance care planning choices and strategies relating to
end of life also require expert support.

3.3 Diagnostic work-up
Besides a thorough clinical evaluation, the medical history, including
detailed information about palliative or reparative surgery and
catheter-based interventions, is of critical importance in the work-up
of ACHD patients. The aim of analysing patient history is to assess
present and past symptoms, as well as to look for intercurrent events
and any changes in medication. The most frequent symptoms


objective measures of exercise capacity. [14] Therefore, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has gained importance for objective
assessment of exercise intolerance in both apparently asymptomatic
and symptomatic patients. In addition, the patient should be questioned about his/her lifestyle to detect progressive changes in daily
activity in order to limit the subjectivity of symptom analysis. In symptomatic patients, alternative causes such as anaemia, depression,
weight gain, and physical deconditioning, besides the congenital
defect and its sequelae or residuae, should be kept in mind and further excluded if necessary.

Clinical examination plays a major role and includes careful evaluation of any changes in auscultation findings, blood pressure, or

development of signs of heart failure. An electrocardiogram
(ECG) and pulse oximetry are routinely carried out alongside clinical
examination. A chest X-ray provides information on changes in heart
size and configuration, as well as pulmonary vascularization. Noninvasive imaging is routinely performed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) involving transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)
and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging where indicated. Thus, patients with CHD may particularly benefit from magnetic resonance-conditional/compatible pacemakers and

defibrillators.

Echocardiography is superior to CMR in estimating pressure gradients and pulmonary artery (PA) pressure (PAP), and detecting
small, highly mobile structures such as vegetations. CMR is ideal for
accurate quantification of ventricular volumes, ejection fraction (EF),
valvular regurgitation, [15] calculation of pulmonary and systemic blood
flow, and myocardial fibrosis assessment. Cardiovascular computed
tomography (CCT) with modern single or dual source scanners can
be performed with dose-saving protocols and may be required for
special indications � as indicated in Table 6. Interdisciplinary expert
collaboration is important: imaging CHD experts need to respond to
feedback from CHD surgeons, interventionalists, and electrophysiologists to optimize imaging contribution to care, as well as work with
each other to enhance appropriate use of multimodality imaging.
Advanced imaging is usually best reserved for when patients are seen
in the specialist centre rather than be repeated.

Echocardiography, CMR, and CCT require staff with expertise in
CHD as well as in imaging, which has training and resource implications. Within the ESC, this is recognized by a certification examination of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI),
separate from the standard TTE, TOE, or CMR examination, and
specific to CHD.

3.3.1 Echocardiography
Echocardiography remains the first-line imaging modality. [16] M-mode,
two-dimensional, and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography are
all used for imaging, whereas tissue Doppler imaging and deformation
imaging, especially longitudinal strain and strain rate, are becoming
integral parts of functional assessment. [17]

Echocardiography provides information on cardiac anatomy, situs
(including orientation and position of the heart), connection of the

atria and ventricles, heart valves, and connection of ventricles with

the great arteries. For assessment of morphology and function of cardiac valves, TTE and, if necessary, TOE (nowadays often combined
with 3D echocardiography), is the preferred imaging modality. This is
also true for shunt lesions, such as ASDs or ventricular septal defects
(VSDs): 3D echocardiography enables an en face view, which can be
helpful in the assessment of the size and shape of a defect and its relation to surrounding structures.
Ventricular size, shape, volume, and EF can be measured and calculated with TTE. Signs of volume overload, in the case of a shunt or
valvular regurgitation, or pressure overload, in the case of increased
afterload, are detected in a good-quality TTE. Even older techniques
using M-mode for measurement of tricuspid annular plane systolic

excursion and mitral annular plane systolic excursion are still valid,
especially in longitudinal follow-up. For left ventricular (LV) systolic
function, 3D echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging, and
two-dimensional deformation imaging have proved to be robust
tools and deserve to be integrated into clinical practice. Even
accounting for newer techniques, echocardiography retains a key
role in longitudinal follow-up assessment of systolic function of a right
or single ventricle, although for more accurate measurements additional imaging is often needed in the form of CMR.

3.3.2 Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging
CMR has become an essential facility in the specialist unit. It enables 3D
anatomical reconstruction, which is not restricted by body size or
acoustic windows, and has rapidly improving spatial and temporal resolution. [18] CMR requires a regular heart rhythm for optimal image quality,
however, diagnostic CMR studies are often achievable even in patients
with irregular heart rhythms [frequent ectopy or atrial fibrillation (AF)]
and metallic artefacts. CMR is the gold-standard imaging method for
quantification of volumes. It may be an alternative when echocardiography cannot be obtained with sufficient quality, or used as a second
method when echocardiography measurements are borderline or
ambiguous. Furthermore, the lack of radiation makes it a useful tool
when serial evaluations are needed (e.g. for monitoring aortic dimensions). CMR allows calculation of systemic and pulmonary blood flow in
patients with multiple sources of blood supply and, in combination with
invasive catheterization, of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Tissue
characterisation for myocardial fibrosis is a unique capability of CMR.
Late gadolinium enhancement CMR for focal fibrosis and interstitial fibrosis T1 mapping imaging are increasingly being applied in ACHD for
their potential diagnostic and prognostic value. However, large CHD
lesion-specific studies to determine if they predict survival are ongoing.

To mitigate the low risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, gadolinium contrast should be avoided in patients with a low glomerular filtration rate (<30 mL/min/1.73 m [2] ). It is therefore recommended that
creatinine levels are checked prior to CMR. Even though clinical
repercussions have not yet been seen, long-term brain deposits of
gadolinium � regardless of renal function � raised concerns about
cumulative lifetime doses in CHD patients who undergo serial CMR
from a young age. It is preferred, therefore, that gadolinium is selectively administered in specialist centres using a macrocyclic, rather
than linear chelated, gadolinium contrast, which presents a decreased
risk at the lowest dose to achieve image enhancement. [19]

Adults with CHD with conventional pacemakers (PM) and defibrillators (ICD) can undergo CMR within guidelines where local support
is available. [20]

3D CMR imaging can be integrated into electrophysiology (EP)
procedures to inform and guide them. 3D CCT and CMR reconstructions can also be used for virtual reality rehearsal of interventions or planning from patient-specific 3D prints.

Indications for CMR are summarized in Table 6.

3.3.3 Cardiovascular computed tomography
CCT has high spatial resolution and rapid acquisition time; it is particularly relevant for imaging the great vessels, coronary arteries, and
collateral arteries, and for parenchymal lung disease (Table 6). In
many institutions, CCT is the preferred imaging modality in planning



be assessed, with inferior temporal resolution compared with CMR,
typically with an increased radiation dose, and is therefore not used
serially for this indication. Recent rapid developments have substantially reduced the amount of radiation exposure, achieving <5 mSv
for a combined CCT coronary, pulmonary, and aortic angiogram. For
ACHD patients, this has made CCT more attractive for specific indications such as assessment, in particular for coronary artery pathology, and detailed assessment of collaterals. [21]

CCT is particularly useful in emergency settings including dissection, pulmonary embolism, and paravalvular abscess in the setting of
endocarditis, where it may have advantages over echocardiography
and CMR due to being less susceptible to prosthetic valve artefact.
In patients with prosthetic valves (in situ >3 months), fluorine-18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography is useful for early diagnosis of inflammation and infection at the
site of the valve, and also for identifying infection at secondary sites. [22]

3.3.4 Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
Formal exercise testing has an important role in the CHD population,
in which quality of life and functional capacity are key measures of the
success of intervention. CPET, including assessment of objective
exercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption), ventilatory efficiency

[ventilation to carbon dioxide output (VE/VCO 2 ) slope], chronotropic and blood pressure response, as well as exercise-induced
arrhythmia and desaturation, gives a broader evaluation of functional
capacity and physical fitness, and has endpoints which correlate well
with morbidity and mortality in ACHD patients. [23] Serial exercise
testing should therefore be a part of long-term follow-up protocols.
It plays an important role in the timing of interventions and reinterventions. CPET is also a useful tool for recommending the intensity
of physical activity based on an individualized exercise prescription. [24]

The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is another simple test for quantification of exercise capacity; it relates to outcome in patients with PAH.

3.3.5 Cardiac catheterization

Cardiac catheterization is mainly reserved for resolution of specific
anatomical and physiological questions, or for intervention.

Indications include assessment of PVR, ventricular diastolic function

(including constrictive and restrictive physiology), pressure gradients,
shunt quantification, coronary angiography, and evaluation of extracardiac vessels such as aortic pulmonary collateral arteries when noninvasive evaluation leaves uncertainty.
In shunt lesions with Doppler echocardiographic signs of PH, catheterization � including testing of vasoreactivity � remains essential

in the decision on shunt closure. Inhaled nitric oxide is the most

widely used agent for this purpose. Estimation of PVR in shunt lesions
requires accurate calculation of pulmonary flow using the Fick principle. This method with measured oxygen consumption allows the
most accurate cardiac output quantification.
Before surgery, coronary artery imaging should be performed (by
CCT or invasive coronary angiography) in men >40 years of age,
postmenopausal women, and patients with signs of, or one or more
risk factors for, coronary artery disease (CAD). [25]

3.3.6 Biomarkers

Different classes of biomarkers have been reported to be associated
with adverse events in the CHD population, including

neurohormones and markers of myocardial injury (high-sensitivity
troponins) or inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein).
Among the neurohormones, natriuretic peptides [B-type natriuretic
peptide (BNP) and N-terminal-pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP)] are best
studied in ACHD patients. They carry important prognostic information, but are less useful to diagnose heart failure across different cardiac lesions due to a cut-off variability depending on the underlying
defect and type of repair. [26] They are most useful in patients with
biventricular circulation and least useful in patients with a Fontan circulation. [27] Serial testing of natriuretic peptides plays a role in identifying patients at risk for adverse events. Of note, natriuretic peptides
may be increased in cyanotic heart disease simply due to hypoxiainduced peptide secretion. [28]

3.4 Therapeutic considerations

3.4.1 Heart failure

The development of heart failure is a common problem affecting
20�50% of the ACHD population, and is a main cause of death. [29] The
incidence is increasing and is probably underestimated. Since latent
signs and symptoms of heart failure might occur frequently, patients at
high risk of developing heart failure require systematic follow-up and
diagnostic screening. [30] Any haemodynamic abnormalities, including
arrhythmias, potentially causing heart failure that can be addressed by
intervention or surgery must be excluded and, if possible, treated first.
In the absence of specific guidelines, ACHD practitioners follow the
current guidelines for medical treatment for both heart failure and

common heart failure-related comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus,
AF, central sleep apnoea, iron deficiency, and cachexia. [31] However, as
the pathophysiology of cardiorespiratory dysfunction is often different
from the failing circulation in patients with non-congenital (acquired)
heart disease, extrapolation of results from published heart failure studies to ACHD patients are inappropriate, particularly in patients with a
systemic right ventricle (RV), a failing subpulmonary ventricle, or in
patients with a single ventricle physiology. The pathophysiology of
ACHD heart failure with systolic ventricular dysfunction includes a
broad spectrum of causes. Both systemic and subpulmonary ventricles,
whether morphological left or right, single ventricles included, might be
chronically overloaded by pressure and/or volume, which leads to progressive ventricular dysfunction. Altered myocardial architecture (noncompaction) and ventricular interdependence can compromise systolic
ventricular function. Myocardial injury (limited myocardial protection
during bypass, after ventriculotomy, and after chronic hypoxia) may
occur in CHD patients. Finally, ischaemic heart disease � mainly
related to ageing or congenital coronary anomalies � and persistent
tachyarrhythmia might be responsible for impaired systemic and subpulmonary ventricular function. [30] The few available data on heart failure treatments, specifically in ACHD patients, are often not conclusive
and derived from small patient cohorts. As a consequence, ACHDspecific recommendations are mostly based on clinical experience or
position statements. [30] In a biventricular circulation, patients with an
impaired systemic LV are generally treated with conventional heart failure therapy; this is also applied in symptomatic patients with a failing
systemic RV. Diuretics mainly control symptoms; whether the longterm use of inhibitors of the renin�angiotensin aldosterone system or

beta blockers influences clinical outcome remains unknown. Also, no

long-term clinical benefit of conventional heart failure treatment has


might alleviate symptoms. Treatment of symptomatic patients with a
failing single ventricle in a Fontan circulation, or in the case of a persis
�
tent right-to-left (R L) shunt, should always be carefully initiated, taking the labile balance of ventricular preload and systemic afterload into
account. In ACHD patients with heart failure, there are currently only
a few small studies looking at the new drug sacubitril/valsartan, which
was found to decrease morbidity and mortality and implemented in
the therapy of chronic heart failure in recent ESC Guidelines [31], how
ever, no recommendation can be made at this moment. Heart failure

with preserved EF is also not uncommon in ACHD patients.
Therapeutic recommendations should follow the general heart failure
guidelines. On top of medical treatment, cardiac resynchronization
therapy (CRT) has gained increasing interest for use in ACHD patients
with congestive heart failure, despite little evidence on indications and
outcomes. Efficacy of CRT in CHD may vary with the underlying structural and functional substrate, such as anatomy of the systemic ventricle
(left, right, or functionally single), presence and degree of structural systemic atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation, primary myocardial disease or scarring, and type of electrical conduction delay. [32]

It is expected that the incidence of acute heart failure in ACHD
patients will also increase over time due to increasing age and more
complex diseases. The knowledge of correct use of inotropes, the
availability of extra-corporal membrane oxygenation, and advanced
bridging techniques are the minimum requirements to adequately
support ACHD patients with acute heart failure; transfer to an
expert centre is recommended. [33]

Heart transplantation may also be considered as a therapeutic option
for end-stage heart failure. Outcome after transplant surgery is continuously improving, particularly in CHD patients, but perioperative mortality still remains higher than in other underlying diseases. This is mainly
related to previous cardiac surgery, complex anatomy and pathophysiology, and comorbidities (multisystem disorder). The increased use of ventricular assist devices can bridge patients to transplantation; in selected
patients, it may be an option as destination therapy. Some patients may
have extreme complex anatomy or high levels of antibodies against the
human leucocyte antigens and are not eligible for transplantation.
In some patients, multiorgan transplantation is required. Heartlung transplantation is applied in CHD patients with irreversible PAH
such as Eisenmenger syndrome, however, the lack of donor organs is
a major limitation.
Simultaneous heart-liver transplantation is rarely done in liver failure after Fontan palliation or in patients with long-standing hepatic
pressure load due to right heart failure [e.g. unrecognized Ebstein’s
malformation of the tricuspid valve (TV)]; experience of this kind of
surgery is limited.
In all cases, timely evaluation for transplantation by ACHD heart
failure specialists in a transplant centre with ACHD expertise is recommended. Advance care planning, eventually including palliative
care, should be offered to all advanced heart failure patients.

3.4.2 Arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death
3.4.2.1 Arrhythmia substrates
The entire spectrum of arrhythmias may be encountered in ACHD
patients. However, some congenital arrhythmia substrates are
related to the malformation itself (Table 7 and section 4). Longer life
expectancy (in conjunction with exposure to conventional risk factors for arrhythmogenic substrates) increases the prevalence of

580 ESC Guidelines

Table 7 Risk estimates for arrhythmic events and bradycardias in ACHD

AF = atrial fibrillation; ASD = atrial septal defect; AV = atrioventricular; AVRT = atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia; AVSD = atrioventricular septal defect; ccTGA = congenitally
corrected transposition of the great arteries; CHD = congenital heart disease; EAT = ectopic atrial tachycardia; IART = intraatrial reentrant tachycardia; SCD = sudden cardiac death;
SND = sinus node dysfunction; TGA = transposition of the great arteries; TOF = tetralogy of Fallot; VSD = ventricular septal defect; VT = ventricular tachycardia.
a Considering the high prevalence of VSD, the overall risk in unselected patients with VSD is considered to be minimal.
b SCD may be due to supraventricular arrhythmias with rapid AV conduction.
c VT higher estimated risk in complex dextro-TGA.
d Non-arrhythmic.


arrhythmias related to structural remodelling, which may occur at a
younger age than in the general population, e.g. AF.
Other arrhythmias are related to the type and timing of the ACHD
repair. Right atrial (RA) incisions, together with cardiac remodelling
secondary to haemodynamic overload, contribute to the high prevalence of atrial tachycardias (AT) in various CHDs. Most frequently
encountered is late intraatrial reentrant tachycardia (IART), in particular cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter. Atrial rates between
150 and 250 beats per minute may lead to rapid AV conduction, haemodynamic compromise, and sudden cardiac death (SCD).
Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) also depends on the malformation (Table 7) and type of repair, [34][,][35] with the critical part of the
macro-reentry circuit typically located within anatomically well-defined


patients with progressive failure of the systemic or subpulmonary ventricle, more complex EP changes may occur. These changes involve ion
channel remodelling, alterations in calcium handling, and remodelling of
the extracellular matrix leading to different arrythmias including less
well-organized fast polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF). [36]

3.4.2.2 Assessment in patients with suspected/documented
arrhythmias and arrhythmia management
In symptomatic patients without arrhythmia documentation at presentation, evaluation depends on the frequency [Holter registration,
device interrogation (if present), event recorder] and circumstances
(exercise testing) of symptoms.
The usefulness of periodic evaluation beyond 12-lead ECGs (e.g.
periodic Holter) in asymptomatic patients is less clear. A high

ESC Guidelines 581


prevalence of asymptomatic findings has been reported that rarely
change management. [37]

In all patients, evaluation for a reversible cause of the arrhythmia
(e.g. hyperthyroidism, inflammatory process) and new or residual
haemodynamic abnormalities is important. Arrhythmias causing haemodynamic instability require immediate termination irrespective of
duration/anticoagulation following current recommendations. [32]

Post-conversion, sinus arrest/bradycardia may occur and availability
of back-up pacing needs to be considered in patients at risk for sinus
node dysfunction (SND) (Table 7). If IART/AF is tolerated and lasting
>_48 h, cardiac thrombus needs to be ruled out (TOE) and/or appropriate anticoagulation (>3 weeks) and pharmacological rate control
needs to be initiated before cardioversion using a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker (in patients with normal systemic ventricular
function and absent preexcitation). [32][,][37][,][38] Maintenance of sinus
rhythm is the aim in all CHD patients. [32][,][37] Catheter ablation is recommended as first-line therapy and preferred over long-term pharmacological treatment, in case of amenable, circumscribed
substrates, as antiarrhythmic drugs are often associated with negative
inotropic and/or dromotropic effects. [32] Antiarrhythmic drugs such as
class IC drugs may slow the rate of IART without blocking AV conduction allowing 1:1 conduction with worsening haemodynamics. [32]

Amiodarone may be considered for AT/AF recurrence prevention in
patients with CHD and systemic ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophy of systemic ventricle, or CAD, in whom catheter ablation fails or
is otherwise no option. Side effects of amiodarone are frequent and it
should be used with caution in cyanotic CHD, low body weight, hep

atic, thyroid, or pulmonary disease, or prolonged QT interval. Longterm amiodarone therapy is not advised in young CHD patients. [32]

For optimal chronic arrhythmia management, referral to a centre
with a multidisciplinary team and expertise in CHD-related arrhythmias is mandatory. [32][,][37] For more specifications on anticoagulation

see section 3.4.7.

3.4.2.3 Sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular block, and infra-hisian
conduction delay
Periodic Holter for patients at risk for SND and AV block should be
considered in asymptomatic patients. Chronic SND/bradycardia with
ineffective atrial haemodynamics may affect atrial remodelling and
facilitate IART. Patients with post-operative AV block are considered
at increased risk for SCD. Accordingly, broader indications for pacemaker implantation compared with patients with structurally normal
hearts have been suggested. [20][,][32]

In ACHD patients with a biventricular circulation and a systemic

LV, indications for CRT follow standard criteria. Of note, conven
tional ventricular pacing rather than bundle branch block is the major
cause of systemic ventricular dysfunction. Accordingly, CRT is recommended in ACHD with a systemic EF <_35% and intrinsic narrow
QRS, and an anticipated requirement for significant pacing and new
device placement. Alternatively, his bundle pacing could be considered. Efficacy of CRT in ACHD may vary across defects and may
depend on the individual anatomy and causes of dyssynchrony (e.g.
systemic RV/single ventricle, AV valve regurgitation, scarring). In general, QRS duration alone may not be a sufficient predictor and
follow-up data are limited. In addition, thoracotomy or hybrid lead
implantation is often required and data on longevity of CRT are
lacking. [32]


3.4.2.4 Sudden cardiac death and risk stratification
SCD related to ventricular arrhythmia is of concern (7�26% of all
deaths in adults). [29][,][39][,][40] Although the incidence in the CHD population at large is relatively low (<0.1% per year), some defects place
patients at higher risk, with occasional disease-specific substrates and
risk factors (Table 7). Identifying patients at risk for SCD remains a
challenge.

ICD implantation for secondary prevention of SCD and for primary prevention in patients with biventricular physiology and a systemic LV follows standard criteria. [37][,][41] Antiarrhythmic drugs may be
used as an adjunct to an ICD in order to reduce the ventricular
arrhythmia burden. [32] The benefit of ICD therapy in primary prevention for single or systemic RVs is less well established.

Accordingly, with the exception of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), specific guidelines regarding ICD implantation for primary prevention in
CHD remain elusive. [32][,][37] Transvenous ICD systems have been used,
but in patients with limited venous access to the ventricle or intracardiac shunt, the subcutaneous ICD may be an alternative. However,
not all patients are eligible due to the risk of inappropriate sensing
and lack of antitachycardia and antibradycardia pacing.

The usefulness of programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in
asymptomatic patients with CHD is unclear. It seems reasonable in
patients with ventricular incisions and/or a substrate for ventricular
reentry typically, but not exclusively, encountered in repaired TOF
(rTOF). It is important to recognize other causes of SCD due to bradycardia/total AV block and bradycardia-induced ventricular arrhythmia with or without long QT, and IART/AF with rapid conduction.

3.4.3 Pulmonary hypertension
3.4.3.1 Introduction and classification
PH is an important prognostic factor in patients with CHD, [42] requiring particular attention in pregnancy [43] or prior to reparative cardiac
or other major surgery. Until recently, PH was defined by an increase
in invasively measured mean PAP >_25 mmHg at rest. [44] While this has
now been reduced to >20 mmHg, [45] classification as pre-capillary PH
� also called PAH � additionally requires an increase in PVR >_3
Wood units (WU) (Table 8). [45] This increase in resistance in this
group is due to an obstructive pulmonary vasculopathy which is
driven by genetic background, modifier genes, vascular shear stress,
and environmental triggers. [44] It is important to separate PAH associated with CHD (PAH-CHD, in group 1 of the PH classification [44] )
from conditions with an LV filling pressure >15 mmHg (post-capillary
PH due to passive transmission of LV filling pressures in groups 2 and
5 of the PH classification), [44] because of the futility of PAH-targeted
treatments in post-capillary PH. Clinical subtypes of PAH-CHD are
PAH with congenital systemic-pulmonary shunts, Eisenmenger syndrome, repaired defects, and PAH that appears coincidental with
CHD, frequently with small defects. Fontan circulation is another
condition with pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) and sometimes elevated PVR. An increase in PAP in these patients is, however, more
frequently caused post-capillary (increase in ventricular filling pressure and/or AV valve regurgitation). In complex CHD, PAH may be
restricted to certain segments of the pulmonary vascular bed (segmental PAH). [46] This is most frequently encountered in complex pulmonary atresia with VSD.

Although PAH-CHD can occur in males and females of any age, the
disease is more frequently encountered in females, and increases with
biological age and age at defect closure. [47] The sex bias disappears in
PAH-CHD after defect repair. [48] More recently, a nationwide CHD

accounting for 100 per million in the general adult population. [47]

3.4.3.2 Diagnosis
The 2015 guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH presented
a haemodynamic algorithm for the diagnosis of PH, highlighting the
role of right heart catheterization to differentiate pre- from postcapillary PH. [44] The algorithm has recently been modified, [45] and
Table 8 illustrates current definitions of different types of PH and the
settings in which they may occur in ACHD. In this definition, mean
PAP threshold is >20 instead of >_25 mmHg in the presence of a PVR
>_3 WU to define pre-capillary PH. [45]

3.4.3.2.1 Diagnostic work-up of pulmonary hypertension in adult congenital

heart disease.

The diagnostic work-up includes medical history, physical examination,
lung function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, imaging (especially echocardiography), and laboratory testing (including total blood cell counts,
serum iron levels, haematocrit, infectious diseases, and NT-pro-BNP
measurements). In general, right heart catheterization with compartmental oximetry is required for major decisions such as start and follow-up
of vasodilator therapy, pregnancy, or surgery. The threshold for invasive
assessment is, however, higher in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.
Invasive haemodynamic assessment is usually not required for guiding
therapeutic interventions over time. Because higher haematocrit levels
lead to higher PVR, this may have to be taken into account. [49]

3.4.3.2.2 Risk assessment.

Outcomes of PAH-CHD patients have improved with the availability
of new PAH therapies, advances in surgical and perioperative management, and use of a team-based, multidisciplinary approach. [44][,][50][,][51]

In recent series, outcomes of PAH-CHD patients appear to be better
than in idiopathic PAH, [48] but depend on the PH subset. Outcomes of

PAH associated with small defects resemble the dismal outcomes of

idiopathic PAH, presumably because these conditions are based on a

In recent series, outcomes of PAH-CHD patients appear to be better
than in idiopathic PAH, [48] but depend on the PH subset. Outcomes of

PAH associated with small defects resemble the dismal outcomes of

idiopathic PAH, presumably because these conditions are based on a


similar vascular proliferative disorder. PAH after defect repair carries
even worse prognosis. [48]

3.4.3.3 Therapeutic management of pulmonary hypertension in adult
congenital heart disease

3.4.3.3.1 Expert centres.
Successful management of an ACHD patient with PH requires a multidisciplinary management team comprising experts in imaging, cardiology, respiratory medicine, haematology, infectious diseases,
obstetrics, anaesthesiology, neonatology, PH, thoracic and cardiovascular surgery, nursing, and medical genetics.

3.4.3.3.2 General measures.

The main general measures are social and psychological
support, vaccination, and avoidance of excessive physical stress.
Follow-up visits are planned individually. Pregnancy must be avoided
in all cases of pre-capillary PH. Continuous supplemental oxygen is
recommended when the arterial blood oxygen pressure is consistently <60 mmHg, [44] except in Eisenmenger patients in whom it is only
recommended when it produces a documented, consistent, and significant increase in oxygen saturation and improvement of symptoms.

3.4.3.3.3 Anticoagulation.
Anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in the absence of
atrial arrhythmia, mechanical valves, or vascular prosthesis is not generally recommended in PAH-CHD, and has to be decided on an individual basis, e.g. large PA aneurysms with thrombus or previous

thromboembolic events. No data exist on the use of non-vitamin K

antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). In patients with
Eisenmenger syndrome, data supporting the routine use of anticoagulation are lacking, but oral anticoagulation should be considered in
patients with atrial arrhythmias and may be considered in the presence of PA thrombosis or embolism and low bleeding risk. As the
risk of bleeding is increased in cyanotic patients, the use of oral

584 ESC Guidelines


anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents should be considered carefully
on a case-by-case basis.

3.4.3.3.4 Shunt repair.
Because endothelial shear triggers PH, [52] surgical/interventional repair of
conditions of increased flow are conceptualized to protect the pulmonary vasculature. The threshold PVR permitting reparative surgical clo
�
sure of a left-to-right (L R) shunt without right heart failure differs for
the different shunt lesions (see sections 4.1�4.4). However, the decision
to close a shunt is made using all the available information and is not
solely dependent on the haemodynamics obtained at cardiac catheterization; [53][,][54] the decision should only be taken in expert centres.

There is no prospective evidence that a treat-and-repair approach
in patients with PAH-CHD confers long-term benefits. [44][,][55] No prospective data are available on the usefulness of vasoreactivity testing,

3.4.3.3.5 Pulmonary arterial hypertension-directed medical therapy.
Advanced therapies benefit patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, [51]

and likely also other PAH-CHD. [61][,][62] According to the 2015 ESC/ERS
Guidelines on PH, [44] pre-capillary PH (PAH), including Eisenmenger
syndrome, is a moderate- to high-risk condition and requires a proactive approach using initial [63] or sequential combination treatment, [64][,][65]

including parenteral prostacyclins. [44] Parenteral prostaglandins work
best when started early. [66] The presence of a central intravenous
catheter for parenteral therapy, however, increases the risk of paradoxical embolism and infection in Eisenmenger patients and those
with R�L shunt lesions. In this setting, subcutaneous or inhaled forms
of administration are therefore generally preferred.

Exclusions to this rule are patients with closed or coincidental
defects meeting strict criteria for vasodilator responsiveness (mainly
a decrease of mean PAP >10 mmHg and below 40 mmHg acutely
under nitric oxide inhalation) who may be treated with calcium channel blocker therapy only. However, such patients are extremely rare
among adults with PAH-CHD. General vasoreactivity testing is not
recommended in PAH-CHD. [44]

Long-term home oxygen therapy may improve symptoms but has
not been shown to augment survival in Eisenmenger patients. The
use of supplemental oxygen should be restricted to those cases in
which it produces a documented, consistent, and significant increase
in arterial oxygen saturation and improves symptoms.
Secondary erythrocytosis is beneficial for adequate oxygen transport and delivery, and routine phlebotomy should be avoided; for

more details see section 3.4.8.

In Eisenmenger patients, the endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA)
bosentan has been shown to improve 6MWT and decrease PVR after
16 weeks of treatment in World Health Organization (WHO) functional class III patients. [67] Although a beneficial effect of bosentan has
been shown on exercise capacity and quality of life in this group of
patients, an effect on mortality is less well documented. Long-term follow-up showed sustained improvement in symptoms. Experiences
with other ERAs and the phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors,
sildenafil and tadalafil, show favourable functional and haemodynamic
results in patients with PAH-CHD and Eisenmenger syndrome, with
less robust evidence. Experience is limited for latest-generation PAH
drugs such as macitentan, selexipag, or riociguat in the setting of
CHD. [66] While patients with simple repaired lesions have been


included in the landmark studies for these substances, and are likely to
benefit similarly to idiopathic PAH patients, data are currently limited
for Eisenmenger patients. A recent randomized controlled trial investigating efficacy of macitentan to improve 6MWT in Eisenmenger syndrome was neutral. [68] Most centres follow a sequential symptomorientated treatment strategy in Eisenmenger syndrome, generally
starting with an oral ERA or PDE-5 inhibitor and escalating therapy if
symptoms persist or in the case of clinical deterioration. Should an
adequate improvement in symptoms not be achieved with oral therapy, parenteral options should be considered proactively.

The effect of PAH therapy in patients with segmental PAH remains
a matter of debate. While some series reported promising results,
there have been cases where therapies were not tolerated. [46]

Heart-lung or lung transplantation with heart surgery is an option
in special cases not responsive to medical treatment but is limited by
surgical complexity and organ availability.

3.4.4 Surgical treatment
Cardiac surgery in ACHD patients deserves special attention. Even
small operations can carry a high risk due to the dysregulation of the
delicate balance in which ACHD patients often thrive. This risk cannot be calculated using conventional surgical risk scores. The adult
congenital heart surgery score was derived from the Society of






ESC Guidelines 585


Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database as the first
evidence-based score, designed specifically for surgery in ACHD. [70]

Upon evaluation, the score reached a good predictive power in
ACHD, although the corresponding paediatric score performed better in children, [71] indicating that in ACHD, individual patients’ comorbidities may play a more important role in determining outcomes.
The ACHD mortality score, an expert-based score that accounts for
comorbidities, may therefore also be considered for evaluating the
risk of cardiac surgery in ACHD. [72]

Apart from the need for personalized risk assessment, understanding the specific anatomy and haemodynamics, experience with
redo surgery, and special requirements in intensive care units are
factors that determine short- and long-term outcomes. When
ACHD patients are operated on by a congenital cardiac surgeon,
outcome is proven to be superior. [73] Therefore, the strict recommendation is that all ACHD patients are operated on by a congenital cardiac surgeon in a multidisciplinary environment with
expertise in ACHD. This holds true for all ACHD cardiac surgery
in the present recommendations except for surgery of uncomplicated bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), heritable thoracic aortic disease
(HTAD) such as Marfan syndrome, and secundum-type ASD without anomalous pulmonary venous connection and/or absence of
PVD. The multidisciplinary expert environment also favours the
growing interest in, and need for, hybrid procedures, where (congenital) cardiac surgeons, vascular surgeons, interventional congenital cardiologists, and electrophysiologists collaborate in technically
challenging procedures.

3.4.5 Catheter intervention

Catheter-based interventions, either as stand-alone or hybrid procedures, are an appealing alternative to conventional open-heart surgery, obviating the need for redo sternotomy/thoracotomy and
cardiopulmonary bypass. The most frequent percutaneous interventions are closure of shunt lesions (in particular secundum-type ASD,
rarely VSD, and persistent arterial duct), fistula, or unusual collaterals;
balloon dilatation of the pulmonary valve and valved grafts; balloon
dilatation and/or stenting of narrowed great vessels [e.g. (re-coarctation of the aorta (CoA) and pulmonary arterial stenosis]; and transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI). ACHD diagnosis and,
in particular, interventional care should be delivered by people who
are trained as CHD caregivers and are part of an ACHD care centre,
where individual procedures are reviewed and discussed within a
multidisciplinary team. [74] It is of particular importance that a programme performing transcatheter interventions in ACHD patients
should be co-located with appropriate congenital cardiac services for
the management of procedural complications. In many programmes,
experienced paediatric interventional cardiologists form an important component of ACHD intervention services, but in others (e.g.
those based in a separate paediatric hospital), paediatric interventionalists may be uncomfortable with the interventional management of
adults with congenital cardiac problems. Therefore, full collaboration
between adult and paediatric cardiology is recommended.

Concentration of ACHD catheterization in a limited number of des
ignated centres allows quality assurance as well as co-location of key
cardiovascular services. [74] Minimum annual numbers of interventions

per centre have been proposed in a recent recommendation



3.4.6 Infective endocarditis

The risk of infective endocarditis (IE) in ACHD patients is higher than
in the general population, with marked variation between lesions.

The 2015 ESC Guidelines on IE maintain the restriction of antibiotic

prophylaxis to patients at high risk of IE undergoing at-risk dental procedures. [22] High-risk conditions are prosthetic valves, including transcatheter valves, valve repair using a prosthetic ring, previous IE, any
cyanotic CHD, and any CHD repaired with prosthetic material up to
6 months after the procedure or lifelong if residual shunt or valvular

regurgitation remains.

Non-specific hygiene measures should be applied in all ACHD
patients: good oral and cutaneous hygiene, and aseptic measures during healthcare and any invasive procedure. Piercings and tattoos are
discouraged and otherwise should be performed in optimal hygienic

conditions.

All patients need to be educated about symptoms of IE and appropriate behaviour (seeking medical advice, importance of blood cultures before starting antibiotic treatment) at occurrence of such

symptoms.
Recent studies confirmed the relatively high risk of IE in patients
after valve surgery, particularly previous IE and bovine jugular vein
conduits. [75][�][78] Specific awareness is needed after TPVI using a
Melody valve prosthesis. [75]

3.4.7 Antithrombotic treatment

Patients with ACHD are at increased risk of thromboembolic events,

but evidence on prevention is limited. In patients with IART or AF,
the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores have proven beneficial in
adult patients with acquired heart disease. [38] However, as their validity in the CHD population is uncertain, the scores should only be
used in combination with individually assessed risks. Traditionally,
VKAs are used for thromboembolic prevention, but in general cardiology, NOACs are currently recommended in preference to VKA.
Also, in the CHD population, NOACs seem similarly safe and effec
tive, in the absence of mechanical valves or severe mitral valve stenosis. [79][,][80] Anticoagulation therapy is recommended in paroxysmal and
persistent AF/IART in patients with moderate or severe CHD, but an
individualized approach remains necessary. In patients with mild
CHD, the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and HAS-BLED scores [38] should be used
as per general recommendations. [81] Whether all Fontan patients benefit from anticoagulation is unclear at the moment. Bleeding risk
should also be considered and weighed against thrombogenic risk,
especially in cyanotic patients. For secondary prevention, anticoagulation is recommended in patients with a thromboembolic event or
incidental intracardiac or intravascular thrombus (see also 2017 ESC/

EACTS Guidelines on valvular heart disease and 2018 ESC

Guidelines on pregnancy).

3.4.8 Management of cyanotic patients
Cyanosis is caused by R�L shunt due to an anatomical communication between the systemic and pulmonary circulation at the atrial,
ventricular, or arterial level. Cyanotic heart disease comprises a heterogeneous group of lesions with different underlying anatomy and
pathophysiology: normal or restricted pulmonary blood flow in the
presence of an obstruction across the pulmonary outflow tract or
increased pulmonary blood flow in the absence of such an obstruction which, in some defects, may result in development of PAH and


Upon evaluation, the score reached a good predictive power in
ACHD, although the corresponding paediatric score performed better in children, [71] indicating that in ACHD, individual patients’ comorbidities may play a more important role in determining outcomes.
The ACHD mortality score, an expert-based score that accounts for
comorbidities, may therefore also be considered for evaluating the
risk of cardiac surgery in ACHD. [72]

Apart from the need for personalized risk assessment, understanding the specific anatomy and haemodynamics, experience with
redo surgery, and special requirements in intensive care units are
factors that determine short- and long-term outcomes. When
ACHD patients are operated on by a congenital cardiac surgeon,
outcome is proven to be superior. [73] Therefore, the strict recommendation is that all ACHD patients are operated on by a congenital cardiac surgeon in a multidisciplinary environment with
expertise in ACHD. This holds true for all ACHD cardiac surgery
in the present recommendations except for surgery of uncomplicated bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), heritable thoracic aortic disease
(HTAD) such as Marfan syndrome, and secundum-type ASD without anomalous pulmonary venous connection and/or absence of
PVD. The multidisciplinary expert environment also favours the
growing interest in, and need for, hybrid procedures, where (congenital) cardiac surgeons, vascular surgeons, interventional congenital cardiologists, and electrophysiologists collaborate in technically

eventually Eisenmenger syndrome (see sections 3.4.3 and 4.15).
They may present with or without prior palliative intervention.
Cyanotic patients are complex and must be followed by an ACHD
specialist.

3.4.8.1 Adaptive mechanisms
Cyanosis induces adaptive mechanisms to improve oxygen transport
and delivery to the tissue: secondary erythrocytosis, rightward shift
of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, and increase in cardiac
output. [82][,][83] Erythrocytosis secondary to erythropoietin stimulus is
the physiological response to chronic hypoxaemia. Compensated
erythrocytosis reflects an equilibrium and decompensated erythrocytosis indicates failure of an equilibrium (excessive red blood cell/haemoglobin increase and unstable, rising haematocrit with major
hyperviscosity symptoms). [82][,][84]

3.4.8.2 Multisystem disorder
Cyanosis and secondary erythrocytosis imply profound consequences for the entire organ system: [82][,][84][,][85]

 - [Blood viscosity is increased and is directly related to red blood]
cell mass. [84]

 - [Haemostatic abnormalities are common and complex and are]

attributed to abnormalities in platelets (thrombocytopaenia and
thrombasthenia), coagulation pathways, and other abnormal
coagulation mechanisms. Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors
and factor V are reduced, fibrinolytic activity is increased, and the
largest von Willebrand multimers are depleted.

 - [Increased turnover of red blood cells/haemoglobin and impaired]
urate filtration lead to hyperuricaemia. [86] The increased concentration of unconjugated bilirubin puts cyanotic patients at risk for
calcium bilirubinate gallstones.

 - [Severe endothelial dysfunction is evident by the striking impair-]
ment of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. [85]

 - [Chronic hypoxaemia, increased blood viscosity, and endothelial]

dysfunction affect microcirculation, myocardial function, and the
function of other organ systems.

3.4.8.3 Clinical presentation and natural history
Clinical presentation includes central cyanosis, a result of an
increased quantity of reduced haemoglobin (>5 g/100 mL blood),
clubbing, and frequently scoliosis. The underlying anatomy/pathophysiology characterizes cardiac findings.
Mortality is significantly higher in cyanotic patients than in acyanotic
patients. [87] Outcome is determined by the underlying anatomy, pathophysiology, palliative procedures, complications of cyanosis, and
preventive measures. [88][,][89] Low platelet count, severe hypoxia, cardiomegaly, and elevated haematocrit during childhood are parameters to
predict premature death and adverse events in patients with and without PVD. [90] Iron deficiency is associated with adverse late outcome; [91][,][92]

BNP can predict outcome in Eisenmenger patients. [93][,][94] However, in a
multicentre study, [89] only age, pre-tricuspid shunt, absence of sinus
rhythm, lower oxygen saturation at rest, and presence of pericardial
effusion, but not BNP, were the strongest predictors for death.

3.4.8.4 Late complications

 - [Hyperviscosity symptoms include headache, faintness, dizziness,]



lips, muscle pain, and weakness (classified moderate when they
interfere with some activities, severe when they interfere with
most activities). [82][,][83] Hyperviscosity symptoms are unlikely in an
iron-replete patient with haematocrit <65%.

 - [Bleeding and thrombotic diathesis occur; both cause a therapeu-]

tic dilemma (risks of thrombosis and bleeding). Spontaneous
bleeding is usually minor, self-limiting (dental bleeding, epistaxis,
easy bruising, menorrhagia). Haemoptysis is the most common
major bleeding event and is an external manifestation of an intrapulmonary haemorrhage not reflecting the extent of parenchymal bleeding (reported in up to 100% of Eisenmenger
patients). [95][,][96] Thrombosis is caused by coagulation abnormalities,

stasis of blood in dilated chambers and vessels, atherosclerosis

and/or endothelial dysfunction, the presence of thrombogenic
material (e.g. conduits), and arrhythmias. The haemostatic abnormalities do not protect against thrombotic complications.
Laminated thrombi in large, partially calcified and aneurysmal PAs
are common (up to 30%). [97][�][100] Female sex, low oxygen saturation, older age, biventricular dysfunction, and dilated PAs have
been identified as risk factors. [97][,][100][,][101]

 - [Cerebrovascular infarctions are common, but underreported.] [97]

They may be caused by thromboembolic events (paradoxical
embolism, supraventricular arrhythmia), rheological factors
(microcytosis), endothelial dysfunction, and traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. The severity of secondary erythrocytosis is
not in itself a risk factor. [102] Microcytosis caused by iron deficiency, due to inappropriate phlebotomies, was the strongest
independent predictor for cerebrovascular events in one study. [91]

Severity of cyanosis and CHD complexity are other risk
factors. [97]

 - [Paradoxical emboli may be caused by transvenous leads or]

catheters.

 - [Iron deficiency is frequently caused by, and may be exacerbated]

by, inappropriate phlebotomies or heavy menstruation in female

patients.

 - [Arrhythmias][ �] [supraventricular and ventricular.]

 - [Infectious complications include endocarditis, cerebral abscess,]

and pneumonia. Fever, associated with a new or different headache, raises suspicion of a brain abscess.

 - [Renal dysfunction is common and is due to functional and struc-]

tural abnormalities of the kidneys.

 - [Cholelithiasis is common and can be complicated by cholecysti-]

tis/choledocholithiasis.

 - [Rheumatological complications include gouty arthritis, hypertro-]
phic osteoarthropathy, and kyphoscoliosis. [83]

3.4.8.5 Diagnostic aspects
Particular attention must be paid to hyperviscosity symptoms and
bleeding/ischaemic complications. Oxygen saturation must be
obtained with pulse oximetry at rest for at least 5 min, and exercise
capacity should be assessed on a regular basis, preferably with a

6MWT.

Blood work must include cellular blood count, mean corpuscular
volume (MCV), serum ferritin (serum iron, iron saturation, transferrin, and transferrin saturation may be required for earlier detection
of iron deficiency), creatinine, serum uric acid, clotting profile, BNP/
NT-pro-BNP, folic acid, and vitamin B12 in the presence of elevated

MCV or normal MCV and low serum ferritin.


3.4.8.1 Adaptive mechanisms
Cyanosis induces adaptive mechanisms to improve oxygen transport
and delivery to the tissue: secondary erythrocytosis, rightward shift
of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, and increase in cardiac
output. [82][,][83] Erythrocytosis secondary to erythropoietin stimulus is
the physiological response to chronic hypoxaemia. Compensated
erythrocytosis reflects an equilibrium and decompensated erythrocytosis indicates failure of an equilibrium (excessive red blood cell/haemoglobin increase and unstable, rising haematocrit with major
hyperviscosity symptoms). [82][,][84]


3.4.8.2 Multisystem disorder
Cyanosis and secondary erythrocytosis imply profound consequences for the entire organ system: [82][,][84][,][85]



- [Blood viscosity is increased and is directly related to red blood]

fatigue, tinnitus, blurred vision, paraesthesia of fingers, toes, and

ESC Guidelines 587


3.4.8.6 Laboratory precautions

 - [Coagulation parameters: plasma volume is reduced due to sec-]

ondary erythrocytosis; the amount of sodium citrate must be
adjusted to haematocrit if haematocrit is >55%.

 - [Haematocrit determined with automated electronic particle]

counts (micro-haematocrit centrifugation) results in falsely high
haematocrit due to plasma trapping.

 - [Glucose level can be reduced (increased in vitro glycolysis, which]

results from the increased number of erythrocytes).

3.4.8.7 Indications for intervention
Risk and benefit must be carefully considered and require expertise.
Cyanotic patients without PAH/Eisenmenger syndrome must be
periodically evaluated for any procedure that may improve quality of
life and reduce morbidity, or for eligibility for physiological repair (see
section 4.15).

3.4.8.8 Medical therapy


 - [Arrhythmias: sinus rhythm should be maintained whenever possi-]

ble. Antiarrhythmic therapy must be individualized (medications,
ablation, epicardial PM/ICD). Antiarrhythmic therapy is
extremely difficult; drug therapy should be initiated with particular care and generally in a hospital.

 - [Therapeutic phlebotomy should only be performed in the pres-]

ence of moderate/severe hyperviscosity symptoms due to secondary erythrocytosis (haematocrit at least >65%), in the absence
of dehydration and iron deficiency. [82] Isovolumetric fluid replacement (750�1000 mL of isotonic saline while removing 400�500
mL of blood) should be undertaken.

 - [Blood transfusion may be required in the presence of iron-]

replete anaemia (haemoglobin inadequate to oxygen
saturation) and should not be based on conventional

indications.




 - [Iron supplementation should be performed in the presence of]

iron deficiency (MCV <80 fL, low iron stores) and carefully followed (rebound effect).

 - [Routine anticoagulation/aspirin: currently available data do not sup-]

port any benefit in cyanotic patients to prevent thromboembolic
complications. There is, however, an increased risk of bleeding.

 - [Indication for anticoagulation: atrial flutter/AF (target INR 2][�][2.5;]

higher target INR in the presence of other risk factors). Note laboratory precautions: false high INR values are measured due to
the high haematocrit. There are no data and only anecdotal experiences about the use of NOACs (see also section 3.4.7).

 - [Haemoptysis: requires chest computed tomography if there is an]

infiltrate on the chest X-ray. Bronchoscopy puts the patient at
risk and seldom provides useful information. Therapy includes
discontinuation of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents, oral anticoagulants; treatment of hypovolaemia and anaemia; reduction of physical activity; and suppression of nonproductive cough. Selective embolization of bronchial arteries
may be required for refractory intrapulmonary haemorrhage/
haemoptysis. Antifibrinolytic agents (e.g. inhaled tranexamic acid)
are under investigation and may be a novel approach to treat
haemoptysis. [103] More trials are needed.

 - [Hyperuricaemia:] no indication to treat asymptomatic
hyperuricaemia.

 - [Acute gouty arthritis (atypical presentation) is treated with oral]

or intravenous colchicine, probenecid, and anti-inflammatory
drugs, with attention paid to the risk of renal failure and bleeding.
Uricosuric (e.g. probenecid) or uricostatic agents (e.g. allopurinol) avoid recurrence.

3.4.8.9 Follow-up recommendations
All cyanotic patients require lifelong evaluation with follow-up visits

�
every 6 12 months in a specialized ACHD centre in close collaboration with the family physician. Evaluation includes:



- [Coagulation parameters: plasma volume is reduced due to sec-]

ondary erythrocytosis; the amount of sodium citrate must be
adjusted to haematocrit if haematocrit is >55%.

- [Haematocrit determined with automated electronic particle]

counts (micro-haematocrit centrifugation) results in falsely high
haematocrit due to plasma trapping.

- [Glucose level can be reduced (increased in vitro glycolysis, which]

results from the increased number of erythrocytes).

588 ESC Guidelines



- [Comprehensive evaluation and systematic review of potential]

complications.

- [Blood tests (see][ section 3.4.8.8][)]

- [Education about risk reduction strategies (][Table][ 9][).]

3.4.8.10 Additional considerations

- [Air flight: commercial air travel is well tolerated.] [104][,][105] [Risk-]

reduction strategies include avoidance of travel- and non-travelrelated stress, dehydration, alcoholic drinks, and measures to
prevent deep vein thrombosis.

- [Exposure to high altitude: acute exposure to high altitude]

(>2500 m) should be avoided. Gradual ascent up to 2500 m may

be tolerated.

- [Pregnancy][:][ pregnancy in cyanotic patients, without PH, results in]

significant maternal and foetal complications and requires followup by a Pregnancy Heart Team. Oxygen saturation (>85%) and
haemoglobin (<200 g/L) before pregnancy were the strongest
predictors for live birth in one series. [106] Pregnancy should be
strongly discouraged in Eisenmenger syndrome and in cyanotic
patients without PAH, but an arterial oxygen saturation <90% [43]

(see section 3.5.7).

- [IE prophylaxis: recommended in all patients (see][ section 3.4.6][).]

3.5 Additional considerations

Sex differences

Women have been appropriately included in trials, and sex-stratified
analyses are available to some extent. Data regarding sex difference
on prevalence of CHD, morbidity, and mortality are conflicting. [76][,][107][�][110] Although no differences in mortality were noted in
the CONgenital CORvitia (CONCOR) study, there were significant
sex differences in morbidity (increased risk for PH for women, but
lower risk for IE, aortic complications, and ICD implantation). [111]

Whether these differences relate to genetic and inherent biological
difference, smaller body size, or other not yet defined differences
warrants further exploration. [112]

Sex differences are important for diagnostic evaluation and clinical
decision making. Although recommendations are usually not sex specific, body surface area (BSA)-normalized cut-offs of aortic and cardiac chamber dimensions may correct for smaller BSA in women. [113]

Personalized counselling is essential in women contemplating pregnancy, as indications for intervention in females may set lower absovalues for aortic surgery (hereditary/CHD-associated
aortopathy) or for pulmonary valve replacement (PVRep) in patients
with TOF. [112]

There are data showing different impacts for men than women for
employment, [114] gaps in medical care, [115] and physical activity. [116]

Clinical evaluation, decision making, and counselling may require tailoring to the individual to help ensure equity of outcomes.

Adult congenital heart disease at more advanced

To date, �90% of patients with mild, 75% with moderate, and 40%
with complex heart defects reach the age of 60 years. [117] These
proportions are expected to rise further in the upcoming decades.
Hence, there is a growing population of older persons with CHD


characterized by more comorbidities, inherent age-related risk for
arrhythmia (especially AF), accelerated ageing, acquired disease,
changed responses to medication, earlier onset of geriatric syndromes (e.g. cognitive decline, immobility/falls, failure to thrive,
sensory alterations), and an altered psychosocial profile. [118][,][119]

Dedicated guidelines for older patients with CHD ought to be
consulted to provide adequate care to this more vulnerable
patient population. [120] The onset of acquired diseases starts early
in life, therefore, prevention strategies ought to be implemented
in the first decades of life (at paediatric cardiology).

3.5.3 Advance care planning and end-of-life care
Most patients, independent of defect complexity, wish to discuss
life expectancy prior to being confronted with life-threatening
complications. [121] Such complications may occur during high-risk
interventions or reflect an uncertain illness trajectory. Timely discussion of advance care planning is a critical component of
patient-centred, comprehensive care. [121][,][122] Initiation of this
demanding conversation is difficult. Unplanned hospital admissions, ICD insertion, or functional decline can serve as a trigger
for such conversations. Most patients do not start advance
care planning discussions on their own and wait for the provider’s
initiative. The content of advance care planning discussions
depends on the patient’s physical and psychological health and
preferences. Initially, discussion about life expectancy and treatment preferences may be all the patient wants. With deteriorating health, a holistic assessment of the patient’s wishes and
values, advance directives, nomination of a surrogate decision
maker, and decisions regarding device therapies in ICD patients
are required.

During the process of care, active disease-specific treatment may
progressively become supported and eventually substituted by palliative care. Involvement of palliative care specialists can be supportive.
At any time, it is important to emphasize that active disease-specific
care might continue during the advance care planning process, even
near the end of life, keeping in line with patients’ preferences and
goals. The role of palliative care and family support continues after
the patient’s death in managing bereavement care. [123]

Whenever possible, family members should be involved in all
steps. Patient preferences can change over time and periodic reevaluation of the patient’s wishes is necessary.

3.5.4 Insurance and employment
For ACHD patients, it is often difficult to obtain life-, health-, or travel
insurance, and mortgages. [124][�][126] If insurance is granted, patients frequently need to pay an extra charge or the heart defect as a preexisting condition excludes them from insurance. In general, obtaining insurance or not, and the higher fee, are mostly unrelated to the
complexity of the defect, the functional status of the patient, or the
prognosis, [124][,][126] but are rather a function of the policies of insurance
companies and reflect a large inter- and intra-country variation.
Patients currently need to shop around, and both clinicians and
patient associations may be of help. Insurability is a definite issue that
should be discussed during patient counselling. Also, employment, in
particular the requirements for specific professions, needs attention. [127] Starting in adolescence, choices about education should be

reduction strategies include avoidance of travel- and non-travelrelated stress, dehydration, alcoholic drinks, and measures to
prevent deep vein thrombosis.

- [Exposure to high altitude: acute exposure to high altitude]

(>2500 m) should be avoided. Gradual ascent up to 2500 m may

be tolerated.

- [Pregnancy][:][ pregnancy in cyanotic patients, without PH, results in]

significant maternal and foetal complications and requires followup by a Pregnancy Heart Team. Oxygen saturation (>85%) and
haemoglobin (<200 g/L) before pregnancy were the strongest
predictors for live birth in one series. [106] Pregnancy should be
strongly discouraged in Eisenmenger syndrome and in cyanotic
patients without PAH, but an arterial oxygen saturation <90% [43]


(see section 3.5.7).

- [IE prophylaxis: recommended in all patients (see][ section 3.4.6][).]


3.5 Additional considerations

3.5.1 Sex differences

Women have been appropriately included in trials, and sex-stratified
analyses are available to some extent. Data regarding sex difference
on prevalence of CHD, morbidity, and mortality are conflicting. [76][,][107][�][110] Although no differences in mortality were noted in
the CONgenital CORvitia (CONCOR) study, there were significant
sex differences in morbidity (increased risk for PH for women, but
lower risk for IE, aortic complications, and ICD implantation). [111]

Whether these differences relate to genetic and inherent biological
difference, smaller body size, or other not yet defined differences
warrants further exploration. [112]

Sex differences are important for diagnostic evaluation and clinical
decision making. Although recommendations are usually not sex specific, body surface area (BSA)-normalized cut-offs of aortic and cardiac chamber dimensions may correct for smaller BSA in women. [113]

Personalized counselling is essential in women contemplating pregnancy, as indications for intervention in females may set lower absolute values for aortic surgery (hereditary/CHD-associated
aortopathy) or for pulmonary valve replacement (PVRep) in patients
with TOF. [112]

There are data showing different impacts for men than women for
employment, [114] gaps in medical care, [115] and physical activity. [116]

Clinical evaluation, decision making, and counselling may require tailoring to the individual to help ensure equity of outcomes.


3.5.2 Adult congenital heart disease at more advanced

age
To date, �90% of patients with mild, 75% with moderate, and 40%
with complex heart defects reach the age of 60 years. [117] These
proportions are expected to rise further in the upcoming decades.
Hence, there is a growing population of older persons with CHD
and unique healthcare needs. These older patients are

ESC Guidelines 589


made based on the possibilities to perform heavy exercise and work
night shifts, and the use of specific medication such as oral
anticoagulation.

3.5.5 Exercise and sports
Recommendations for exercise and sports need to be based on the
underlying congenital heart defect and its potential complications, the
haemodynamic and EP status of the patient, and their pre-existing fitness. [24] Counselling must consider the type of sport and the anticipated
effort levels. In general, physicians have been over-conservative in their
advice, especially as physical activity has well-documented benefits for
fitness, psychological well-being, and social interaction, as well as a positive effect on the future risk of acquired heart disease; symptoms do
not exclude physical activity. Dynamic exercise is more suitable than
static exercise. In addition, in patients with known cardiac conditions,
complications during exercise, including SCD, are rare. [128]

Recommendations for participation in low- to high-intensity sports are
discussed in the position paper of Budts et al. [24] Guidelines on elite
sports in athletes with CHD are described in the 2020 ESC Guidelines
on sports cardiology. [129] Assessment of physical exercise capacity
should be done before recommending recreational exercise or sport
in order to avoid intense exercise in untrained patients. Most patients
with CHD can safely engage in regular, moderate physical activity. A
few conditions, such as systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction, systemic ventricular outflow tract obstruction, PH, haemodynamically significant arrhythmias, or aortic dilation, warrant more caution.

3.5.6 Non-cardiac surgery
The evaluation and management of ACHD patients should follow
the principles of the 2014 ESC Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery [130]

and consider the specificities of CHD. Factors associated with
increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality are cyanosis,
congestive heart failure, poor general health, younger age, PH, operations on the respiratory and nervous systems, complex CHD, and
urgent/emergency procedures. In patients with complex CHD
(Fontan, Eisenmenger syndrome, cyanotic patients), non-cardiac surgical and interventional procedures should be performed in an expert
centre. [130][,][131] Issues to consider are endocarditis prophylaxis, complications related to underlying haemodynamics, abnormal venous and/
or arterial anatomy affecting venous and arterial access, persistent
shunts, valvular disease, arrhythmias including bradyarrhythmias,
erythrocytosis, pulmonary vascular disease (PVD), prevention of
venous thrombosis, monitoring of renal and liver function, periprocedural anticoagulation, possible need for non-conventional drug dosing, increased prevalence of hepatitis C infection because of prior
procedures and remote blood transfusions and, finally, developmental disability.

3.5.7 Pregnancy, contraception, and genetic counselling
3.5.7.1 Pregnancy and contraception
The majority of ACHD patients tolerate pregnancy well, but
women with complex CHD have higher risks. Detailed ESC
Guidelines on pregnancy and heart disease were published in 2018. [43]

Pre-pregnancy counselling should be provided to all women with
CHD. Specialist care is best provided in a multidisciplinary team set


ACHD cardiology, obstetrics, and anaesthesia, and where necessary
from other specialists, including clinical geneticists. The team should
be involved in all patients with at least moderate to complex heart
disease before pregnancy for timely counselling and advice during
pregnancy in order to plan antenatal care, including delivery and
post-partum follow-up and need for cardiac monitoring. Risk estima
tion should be individualized and based on the modified WHO
(mWHO) classification (Table 10). [43]

Functional status before pregnancy, ventricular function, severity
of the lesions, and history of previous cardiac events are also of prognostic value. [132] CPET performed before conception can predict
maternal and neonatal outcomes. A blunted heart rate response to
exercise is associated with a higher risk of maternal cardiac and neo
natal adverse events.

�
Maternal mortality is 0 1% and heart failure complicates pregnancy
in 11% of women with heart disease, with PAH being associated with
the highest risks. [133][,][134] Cyanosis poses a significant risk to the foetus,
with live birth unlikely (<12%) if oxygen saturation is <85%. [106]

Women with cardiac disease also have an increased risk of obstet
ric complications, including premature labour, pre-eclampsia, and
postpartum haemorrhage. [135] The potential for drugs affecting the
foetus should always be considered; angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), in particular, should not be used. Women requiring oral anticoagulation
deserve special attention. VKAs are teratogenic, especially at higher
doses. A dose-adjusted treatment algorithm is proposed in the 2018
ESC Guidelines on pregnancy. [43]

The pregnancy duration and mode of delivery should be
decided by the Pregnancy Heart Team, taking the CHD severity

into account.

Contraception should be discussed in a timely fashion with specific
attention to effectiveness and safety. [136] Barrier methods are safe and
protect against sexually transmitted diseases, however, they only
have a high contraceptive efficacy with compliant couples. Hormonal
contraceptives are highly efficacious, but there are few data on their
safety in the ACHD population. The combined oral contraceptive is
highly effective (99.9%), but is best avoided in patients with a preexisting thrombotic risk (cyanosis, Fontan physiology, mechanical
valves, prior thrombotic events, PAH), especially as there are few
data to suggest that concomitant oral anticoagulation therapy will
negate this risk. Progesterone-only contraceptives, on the other
hand, do not pose such a high thrombosis risk, and newer preparations available for oral administration or with intrauterine implants
have a high efficacy (>95%). The risk of endocarditis after insertion of
progesterone-coated intrauterine devices is probably low. However,
there is a risk of vasovagal reactions (5%) at the time of insertion or
removal. Patients with a fragile physiology (e.g. patients with a Fontan
circulation, PH, cyanotic CHD, Eisenmenger syndrome) should have
their intrauterine device inserted/removed in a safe environment (i.e.
in an environment with expertise in ACHD). Female sterilization or
male partner sterilization should only be considered after careful discussion, with particular reference to long-term prognosis.

Assisted reproduction has added risks above those of pregnancy
alone, and consultation with an ACHD specialist must be performed
before treatment. Superovulation is prothrombotic and can be complicated by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, with marked fluid
shifts and an even greater risk of thrombosis. [137] The risk of ovarian


3.5.5 Exercise and sports
Recommendations for exercise and sports need to be based on the
underlying congenital heart defect and its potential complications, the
haemodynamic and EP status of the patient, and their pre-existing fitness. [24] Counselling must consider the type of sport and the anticipated
effort levels. In general, physicians have been over-conservative in their
advice, especially as physical activity has well-documented benefits for
fitness, psychological well-being, and social interaction, as well as a positive effect on the future risk of acquired heart disease; symptoms do
not exclude physical activity. Dynamic exercise is more suitable than
static exercise. In addition, in patients with known cardiac conditions,
complications during exercise, including SCD, are rare. [128]

Recommendations for participation in low- to high-intensity sports are
discussed in the position paper of Budts et al. [24] Guidelines on elite
sports in athletes with CHD are described in the 2020 ESC Guidelines
on sports cardiology. [129] Assessment of physical exercise capacity
should be done before recommending recreational exercise or sport
in order to avoid intense exercise in untrained patients. Most patients
with CHD can safely engage in regular, moderate physical activity. A
few conditions, such as systemic ventricular systolic dysfunction, systemic ventricular outflow tract obstruction, PH, haemodynamically significant arrhythmias, or aortic dilation, warrant more caution.


3.5.6 Non-cardiac surgery
The evaluation and management of ACHD patients should follow
the principles of the 2014 ESC Guidelines on non-cardiac surgery [130]

and consider the specificities of CHD. Factors associated with
increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality are cyanosis,
congestive heart failure, poor general health, younger age, PH, operations on the respiratory and nervous systems, complex CHD, and
urgent/emergency procedures. In patients with complex CHD
(Fontan, Eisenmenger syndrome, cyanotic patients), non-cardiac surgical and interventional procedures should be performed in an expert
centre. [130][,][131] Issues to consider are endocarditis prophylaxis, complications related to underlying haemodynamics, abnormal venous and/
or arterial anatomy affecting venous and arterial access, persistent
shunts, valvular disease, arrhythmias including bradyarrhythmias,
erythrocytosis, pulmonary vascular disease (PVD), prevention of
venous thrombosis, monitoring of renal and liver function, periprocedural anticoagulation, possible need for non-conventional drug dosing, increased prevalence of hepatitis C infection because of prior
procedures and remote blood transfusions and, finally, developmental disability.

hyperstimulation syndrome can be reduced by careful cycle monitoring, using low-dose follicle-stimulating hormone in combination with
a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, freezing all embryos,
and only transferring a single embryo. The last option is strongly
advised in women with heart disease, since conceiving a multiple
pregnancy is associated with greater cardiovascular changes and
more maternal and foetal complications. [138] Pregnancy and fertility

treatment are contraindicated in women with mWHO classification
of maternal cardiovascular risk class IV. [43] In women with mWHO

class III, or those who are anticoagulated, the risk of superovulation is
very high and the alternative of natural cycle in vitro fertilization

should be considered.

Sexuality is an important element of quality of life. The few available data suggest that sexual function is a concern in both women
and men and should be discussed more often. [139]

3.5.7.2 Genetic counselling and recurrence risk
Genetic counselling, whether supplemented with further genetic
testing or not, should at least be considered for every ACHD patient.
Demonstrating a genetic abnormality can be important to further
adjust the patient’s own management and is evidently also important
for family planning. It is estimated that 10�30% of all structural CHD
would have a genetic basis. This rate is higher in cases of associated
organ disorders and familial occurrence, and lower in isolated cases.
With the rapid technical progress and possibilities of genetic testing,
the reliability of these tests is further improving. Naturally, genetic
elaboration in each patient must be multidisciplinary, with integration
of necessary clinical data and adequate interpretation of found
genetic variants. A detailed consensus document on this subject, providing an algorithm for genetic testing and an overview of the main
syndromes to consider, has recently been published. [140]

One of the important and specific aspects of genetic counselling is

the assessment of recurrence risk, which needs consideration in both

men and women. The recurrence rate of CHD in offspring ranges

#### 4 Specific lesions

4.1 Atrial septal defect and anomalous
pulmonary venous connection
4.1.1 Introduction and background
ASD can remain undiagnosed until adulthood. ASD types include:

 - [Secundum ASD (80% of ASDs; located in the region of the fossa]

ovalis and its surrounding).

 - [Primum ASD [15%; synonyms: partial AV septal defect [atrioven-]

tricular septal defect (AVSD) with communication on the atrial
level only], partial AV canal; located near the crux, AV valves are
typically malformed, resulting in various degrees of regurgitation
(see section 4.3)].

 - [Superior sinus venosus defect [5%; located near the superior]

vena cava (SVC) entry, associated with partial or complete connection of right pulmonary veins to SVC/RA].

 - [Inferior sinus venosus defect [<1%; located near the inferior vena]

cava (IVC) entry].

 - [Unroofed coronary sinus [<1%; separation from the left atrium]

(LA) can be partially or completely missing].

Associated lesions include anomalous pulmonary venous connection, persistent left SVC, pulmonary valve stenosis, and mitral valve
prolapse. Interatrial defects are the most frequently associated
defects in Ebstein anomaly (see section 4.9). Treatment decisions are
more complex in the latter combination. The present section deals

with isolated ASD.

The shunt volume depends on RV/LV compliance, defect size, and
LA/RA pressure. A simple ASD results in L�R shunt because of the
higher compliance of the RV compared with the LV (relevant shunt in
general with defect sizes >_10 mm), and causes RV volume overload
and pulmonary overcirculation. Reduction in LV compliance, or any
condition with elevation of LA pressure (hypertension, ischaemic heart
disease, cardiomyopathy, aortic and mitral valve disease), increases
L�R shunt. As a consequence, an ASD may become haemodynamically more important with age. Reduced RV compliance (pulmonic
stenosis, PAH, other RV disease) or TV disease may decrease L�R
shunt or eventually cause shunt reversal, resulting in cyanosis.

4.1.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
Patients frequently remain asymptomatic until adulthood. However,
the majority develop symptoms beyond the fourth decade including
reduced functional capacity, exertional shortness of breath, and palpitations (supraventricular tachyarrhythmias), and less frequently pul


overall, but survival is much better than previously assumed. [142] PAP
can be normal, but on average increases with age. Severe PVD is
nevertheless very rare (<5%); its development presumably requires
additional factors and the disease course is similar to idiopathic
PAH. [48] With increasing age, and with increasing PAP, tachyarrhythmias become more common (atrial flutter, AF). [143] Systemic embolism
may be caused by paradoxical embolism (rare) or AF and atrial flutter.

4.1.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Key clinical findings include fixed splitting of the second heart
sound and a systolic pulmonary flow murmur. ECG typically shows
an incomplete right bundle branch block and right-axis deviation
(superior left-axis deviation in partial AVSD). An increased pulmonary vascularity on chest X-ray is frequently overlooked.

 - [Echocardiography is the first-line diagnostic technique, providing]

diagnosis and quantification. RV volume overload, which may be
the first unexpected finding in a patient with previously undiagnosed ASD, is the key finding and best characterizes the haemodynamic relevance of the defect (preferable to the shunt ratio).
Sinus venosus defects in general require TOE for accurate diagnosis (CMR/CCT is an alternative and superior in case of inferior
sinus venosus defects). TOE is also required for precise evalua
tion of secundum defects before device closure, which should

include sizing, exploration of the residual septum’s morphology,
the rim size and quality, exclusion of additional defects, and confirmation of a normal pulmonary venous connection. 3D echocardiography provides visualization of ASD morphology. Other
key information to be provided includes PAP and tricuspid regurgitation (TR).

 - [CMR is rarely required but may be useful for assessment of RV]

volume overload, identification of inferior sinus venosus defect,

quantification of pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp:Qs), and
evaluation of pulmonary venous connection (alternatively for the
latter, use CCT).

 - [Cardiac catheterization is required in case of non-invasive signs]

of PAP elevation (calculated systolic PAP >40 mmHg or indirect
signs when PAP cannot be estimated) to determine PVR.

 - [Exercise testing should be performed in patients with PAH to]

exclude desaturation.

4.1.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment

Indications for intervention are summarized in the Recommendations

for intervention in atrial septal defect (native and residual) table and in
Figure 2.
Surgical repair has low mortality (<1% in patients without significant comorbidity) and good long-term outcome when performed
early (childhood, adolescence) and in the absence of PH. [144][,][145]

Although surgical repair can be performed with very low risk, even in
the elderly, comorbidities that may affect operative risk need to be
considered and then risk weighed against potential benefit.

assumed to be zero, several recent studies have reported no mortality.
Serious complications have been observed in <_1% of patients. [148][,][149]

Atrial tachyarrhythmias occurring early after intervention are mostly

transient. Erosion of the atrial wall, anterior mitral leaflet, or the aorta,
as well as thromboembolic events, appear to be very rare. [150][,][151]

Antiplatelet therapy is required for at least 6 months (aspirin 75 mg
o.d. minimum). Potential incidence of late arrhythmias or adverse
events still requires investigation. Studies comparing surgery and catheter intervention have reported similar success rates and mortality, but
morbidity was lower and hospital stays shorter with catheter intervention while reintervention rate was slightly higher. [148][,][152]

Outcome is best with repair at age <25 years. [144][,][145] ASD closure
after the age of 40 years appears not to affect the frequency of
arrhythmia development during follow-up. [146][,][153] However, the
patient’s morbidity benefits from closure at any age (exercise
capacity, shortness of breath, right heart failure), particularly when it
can be done by catheter intervention. [146][,][153]

In patients with impaired LV function (systolic and diastolic), ASD
closure may worsen heart failure. These patients must be carefully evaluated and may require pre-interventional testing (balloon occlusion
with reassessment of haemodynamics) to decide between complete,
fenestrated, or no closure, considering that an increase in filling pressure due to ASD closure may worsen symptoms and outcome. [154]

Patients with PH must be evaluated with particular care.
Calculation of PVR is mandatory. In patients with PVR <5 WU, ASD

closure has been shown to be safe and associated with a decrease in
PAP and improvement of symptoms. [60][,][153][,][155] However, even in this
group, the extent of improvement decreases with increasing PAP.
Patients with PVR >_5 WU are unlikely to improve [60] and likely to
have an even worse outcome with complete ASD closure. [48][,][156]

Vasoreactivity testing is not recommended when making the decision
whether to close an ASD in patients with PVR >_5 WU. It appears
safer to treat PAH, re-evaluate haemodynamics during follow-up, and
consider fenestrated closure only when PVR falls below 5 WU in the

�
presence of significant L R shunt. If this is not the case, ASD closure

should be avoided.

In patients with atrial flutter/AF, cryo- or radiofrequency ablation
(modified maze procedure) should be considered at the time of surgery. Device closure may restrict access to the LA for later EP

interventions.

In patients of advanced age with ASDs not suitable for device closure, individual surgical risk due to comorbidities must be carefully
weighed against the potential benefits of ASD closure.

4.1.5 Specific aspects of isolated anomalous pulmonary

venous connections

Anomalous pulmonary venous connections do not only occur in
association with ASD (typically in sinus venous defects) but can also
be isolated. This results in volume overload of the right heart, with a
physiological effect similar to that of an ASD, but when isolated, dif
�
fers in that there is no potential for R L shunting, and the magnitude
of the L�R shunt is not exacerbated by the development of acquired
left heart disease. Most common is the connection of the right upper
pulmonary vein to the SVC. Other abnormal connections include
right pulmonary vein(s) to the IVC (‘scimitar vein’, which may be
associated with sequestration of the right lower lobe), left upper

pulmonary vein(s) to the left innominate vein, and right upper pulmonary vein(s) connecting high on the SVC. Long-term sequelae of
anomalous pulmonary venous connections reflect the impact of right
heart volume overload and are similar to the sequelae of ASDs.
Surgical repair can be challenging as low-velocity venous flow
imparts risk of thrombosis of the surgically operated vein, particularly
in scimitar syndrome; it should only be performed by a congenital
cardiac surgeon.
Indications for surgery follow the principals of recommendation for
ASD closure, but technical suitability for repair and operative risk must
be weighed against the potential benefit of intervention. It is unusual for
a single anomalous pulmonary venous connection of only one pulmonary lobe to result in a sufficient volume load to justify surgical repair.

4.1.6 Follow-up recommendations
Follow-up evaluation should include assessment of a residual shunt, RV
size and function, TR and PAP by echocardiography, and assessment of


residua (no residual shunt, normal PAP, normal RV, no arrhythmias) do
not require regular follow-up. However, patients and referring physicians
should be informed about the possible late occurrence of
tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with residual shunt, elevated PAP, or arrhythmias (before
or after repair) and those repaired at adult age (particularly >40 years)
should be followed on a regular basis, including evaluation in specialized ACHD centres (intervals depending on the severity of residual
problems). After device closure, regular follow-up during the first 2

�
years and then, depending on results, every 3 5 years is reasonable.
Late post-operative arrhythmias after surgical repair at age <40 years
are most frequently IART or atrial flutter, which can be successfully
treated with radiofrequency or cryoablation. Without repair or with
repair after age 40 years, AF becomes more common. In patients who
undergo ASD closure aged >40 years, the prevalence of atrial arrhyth
�
mias is up to 40 60%. Access to the LA may be restricted after device

closure.

SVC stenosis may occur after repair of a sinus venosus defect, as
well as stenoses of redirected pulmonary veins.

594 ESC Guidelines


4.1.7 Additional considerations

 - [Exercise/sports: no restrictions in asymptomatic patients before]

or after intervention without PH, significant arrhythmias, or RV
dysfunction; limitation to low-intensity recreational sports in
PAH patients (see section 3.5.5).

 - [Pregnancy: low risk in patients without PH, although there may be]

an increased risk of paradoxical embolism. Patients with pre-capillary
PH should be counselled against pregnancy (see section 3.5.7).

 - [IE prophylaxis: recommended for 6 months after device closure]

(see section 3.4.6).

4.2 Ventricular septal defect
4.2.1 Introduction and background
VSD is mostly diagnosed and � when indicated � treated before adulthood. Spontaneous closure is frequent in childhood. Several locations
of the defect within the interventricular septum are possible, and these
can be divided into four groups according to their location within the
RV (nomenclature varies and synonyms are added): [157]

 - [Perimembranous/paramembranous/subaortic/conoventricular]

(most common, �80% of VSDs; located in the membranous septum with possible extension into inlet, trabecular, or outlet septum; adjacent to tricuspid and aortic valve; so-called aneurysms of
the membranous septum � i.e. tissue from the septal leaflet of the
TV � are frequent and may result in partial or complete closure).

 - [Muscular/trabecular (up to 15][�][20%; completely surrounded by]

muscle; various locations; frequently multiple; spontaneous closure particularly frequent).

 - [Outlet (with or without malalignment of the outlet septum)/]

supracristal/subarterial/subpulmonary/infundibular/conal/doubly
committed juxta-arterial [�5%; located beneath the semilunar
valves in the conal or outlet septum; may be associated with progressive aortic regurgitation (AR) due to prolapse of the right
aortic cusp and aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva].

 - [Inlet/AV canal/AVSD type (inlet of the ventricular septum imme-]

diately inferior to the AV valve apparatus; associated with a common AV valve; may be associated with AV septal malalignment
and straddling TV; typically occurring in Down syndrome).

Often there is one single defect, but multiple defects do occur.
VSD is also a common component of complex anomalies, such as
TOF, transposition of the great arteries (TGA), and congenitally corrected TGA (ccTGA). Spontaneous closure occurs mainly during
childhood and is uncommon in outlet defects. [158]

The direction and magnitude of the shunt are determined by PVR
and systemic vascular resistance, the size of the defect, LV/RV systolic
and diastolic function, and the presence of right ventricular outflow
tract (RVOT) obstruction (RVOTO) and left ventricular outflow
tract (LVOT) obstruction (LVOTO).

4.2.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
The usual clinical presentations in adults include:

 - [VSD operated on in childhood, without residual VSD and no PH.]

 - [VSD operated on in childhood, with residual VSD. The residual]

shunt size determines the degree of LV volume overload and the




 - [Small VSD with insignificant L][�][R shunt, without LV volume over-]

load or PH (restrictive VSD), which was not considered for surgery in childhood.

 - [VSD with L][�][R shunt, PH (various degrees), and various degrees]

of LV volume overload (rare).

 - [VSD with R][�][L shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome): large, non-]

�
restrictive, VSD with originally large L R shunt and development
of severe PVD eventually resulting in shunt reversal (cyanosis;
see sections 3.4.3 and 3.4.8).

A large majority of patients with a VSD that has been closed
entirely in childhood (spontaneously or surgically), or patients with a
small VSD who were either never operated on or who had a residual
defect after surgical repair with no LV volume overload on echocardiography, usually remain asymptomatic and do not require further
surgery. [159] However, an unknown percentage of patients with a small
residual VSD develop problems later in life. [160] Survival 40 years after
closure appears to remain slightly lower than in the general
population. [161]

Several possible problems may occur with advancing age:

 - [A double-chambered RV (DCRV) can develop over time, mostly]

in perimembranous defects, and may be a result of the jet lesion
of the RV endothelium caused by the high-velocity VSD jet.

 - [In the case of an outlet (supracristal) VSD (less commonly]

perimembranous), there is a risk for prolapse of the right coronary (or non-coronary) cusp of the aortic valve, resulting in
progressive AR and formation of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.

 - [Arrhythmias can occur, but are less frequent than in other forms]
of CHD [162] .

 - [Complete heart block][ �] [rare nowadays][ �] [was not uncommon]

in the earlier years of cardiac smurgery, so can occur, especially
in older patients. These patients usually require lifelong pacing.

 - [Late LV dysfunction and heart failure.]

 - [Endocarditis.]

4.2.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Specific clinical findings include a holosystolic murmur over the third
to fourth left intercostal space, and a precordial thrill may be felt.

 - [Echocardiography is the key diagnostic technique, in general]

providing the diagnosis and assessment of disease severity. Key
findings to provide are location, number, and size of defects,
severity of LV volume overload, and estimated PAP. AR due to
prolapse of the right or non-coronary cusp must be checked for,
especially in the case of outlet (supracristal) and high perimembranous VSDs. DCRV and sinus of Valsalva aneurysm must be

excluded.

 - [CMR can serve as an alternative if echocardiography is insuffi-]

cient, particularly for assessment of LV volume overload and
shunt quantification.

 - [Cardiac catheterization is required in case of non-invasive]

signs of PAP elevation (calculated systolic PAP >40 mmHg or
indirect signs when PAP cannot be estimated) to determine

PVR.

 - [Exercise testing should be performed in patients with PAH to]

exclude desaturation.



- [Exercise/sports: no restrictions in asymptomatic patients before]

or after intervention without PH, significant arrhythmias, or RV
dysfunction; limitation to low-intensity recreational sports in
PAH patients (see section 3.5.5).

- [Pregnancy: low risk in patients without PH, although there may be]

an increased risk of paradoxical embolism. Patients with pre-capillary
PH should be counselled against pregnancy (see section 3.5.7).

- [IE prophylaxis: recommended for 6 months after device closure]

(see section 3.4.6).

4.2.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment

Indications for intervention are summarized in the Recommendations

for intervention in ventricular septal defect (native and residual) table and
in Figure 3.
Surgical closure can be performed with low operative mortality
(1�2%) and good long-term results. [163] Transcatheter closure has
become an alternative, particularly in residual VSDs, in VSDs that are
poorly accessible for surgical closure, and in muscular VSDs that are
located centrally in the interventricular septum. In perimembranous
VSD, it has been shown to be feasible. Whether the risk of complete
AV block and entrapment of TV tissue leading to TR, or the risk of

AR that has been observed in children, is relevant in adults under
going interventional closure of a perimembranous VSD remains to

be seen.

Patients eligible for VSD closure at adult age are rare. Most
patients have either small VSDs with insignificant shunt or have
already developed PH. The latter must be evaluated with particular
caution. Patients with shunt closure and persistent/progressive PAH
appear to have a particularly poor outcome. [48]

4.2.5 Follow-up recommendations
Development of AR or TR, degree of (residual) shunt, LV dysfunction, elevation of PAP, or development of DCRV, should be excluded
or assessed if present by echocardiography.
Possible development of complete AV block requires attention
(patients who develop bifascicular block or transient trifascicular
block after VSD closure are at risk in later years for the development
of complete AV block).

Patients with more than small residual VSD, valvular lesions, or

haemodynamic impairment (LV dysfunction or PAH) should be seen
every year, including evaluation in specialized ACHD centres. In
patients with a small VSD (native or residual, normal LV, normal PAP,

�
asymptomatic) and no other lesion, 3 5-year intervals may be reasonable. After device closure, regular follow-up during the first 2

�
years and then, depending on the results, every 2 5 years is reasonable. After surgical closure without residual abnormality, 5-year intervals may be reasonable.

4.2.6 Additional considerations

 - [Exercise/sports:] no restrictions are required in patients
after VSD closure, or with small VSD without PH, significant
arrhythmias, or LV dysfunction. Patients with PAH must limit
themselves to low-intensity recreational activity/sports (see section 3.5.5).

 - [Pregnancy: patients with pre-capillary PH (PAH) should be coun-]

selled against pregnancy. The risk is low in asymptomatic patients
with normal LV and no PAH (see section 3.5.7).

 - [IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see][ sec-]

tion 3.4.6).

4.3 Atrioventricular septal defect
4.3.1 Introduction and background
An AVSD (AV canal or endocardial cushion defect) is characterized by the presence of a common AV junction. The partial AVSD
usually has a defect only at the atrial level (primum ASD) or, in
rare cases, only at the ventricular level. The anterior and posterior
bridging leaflets are fused centrally, creating separate left- and
right-sided orifices. In a complete AVSD, the central fusion is not
present and there is only one orifice. A complete AVSD (complete
AV canal) has a septal defect in the crux of the heart, extending
into both the interatrial and interventricular septum (non-restrictive inlet VSD). The AV node is positioned posterior and inferior
to the coronary sinus. The bundle of His and the left bundle branch
are displaced posteriorly. This accounts for an abnormal activation
sequence of the ventricles (prolongation of AV conduction time,
left-axis deviation) and is important to recognize during EP studies

and catheter ablation.

Most complete AVSDs occur in Down syndrome patients (>75%),
and most partial AVSDs occur in non-Down syndrome patients
(>90%). AVSD may occur in association with TOF and other forms
of complex CHD. An AVSD with unequal position of the common
AV valve above the ventricles is accompanied by a variable degree of
ventricular hypoplasia (unbalanced AVSD). The following recommendations apply to balanced AVSDs.


Patients eligible for VSD closure at adult age are rare. Most
patients have either small VSDs with insignificant shunt or have
already developed PH. The latter must be evaluated with particular
caution. Patients with shunt closure and persistent/progressive PAH
appear to have a particularly poor outcome. [48]

b Includes all patients with desaturation at rest (Eisenmenger physiology) or on exercise.
c Careful individual decision in expert centres is required.


4.3.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
Clinical presentation depends on the presence and size of the ASD
and VSD and competence of the left-sided AV valve. Symptoms
are not specific for an AVSD and are caused by intracardiac shunt
� �
ing (L R, R L, or bidirectional), PH, AV valve regurgitation, ventricular dysfunction, or LVOTO. Exercise intolerance, dyspnoea,
arrhythmia, and cyanosis may be present. LVOTO (subvalvular)
may be present or develop over time. Complete AV block may
develop late.
The history of unoperated complete AVSD is that of
Eisenmenger syndrome unless the VSD is only small (see sections
3.4.3 and 3.4.8).
Unrepaired primum ASD (partial AVSD) is not uncommon in
adults. The presenting clinical symptoms are that of an L�R shunt at
the atrial level (see section 4.1) and/or that of left-sided AV valve
regurgitation (‘cleft’). Patients may still be asymptomatic, but symptoms tend to increase with age; most adults are symptomatic by 40
years of age.

4.3.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Clinical findings depend on the individual variant (see sections 4.3.1



 - [Echocardiography is the key diagnostic technique. It provides]

assessment of each anatomic component of the AVSD, of the AV
valves and their connections, the severity and exact substrate of
AV valve regurgitation, the magnitude and direction of intracardiac shunting, LV and RV function, PAP, and assessment of the
presence/absence of LVOTO.

 - [CMR is indicated when additional quantification of ventricular]

volumes and function, AV valve regurgitation, or intracardiac
shunting is required for decision making.

 - [Cardiac catheterization is required in case of non-invasive signs]

of PAP elevation (calculated systolic PAP >40 mmHg or indirect
signs when PAP cannot be estimated) to determine PVR.

 - [Exercise testing should be performed in patients with PAH to]

exclude desaturation.

4.3.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment

Catheter closure of AVSDs is not feasible, and intervention is there
fore surgical (defect closure, valve repair). In cases of residual interatrial or interventricular communications, endocardial pacing causes
an elevated risk of paradoxical emboli; this should be taken into
account when pacing is indicated. Epicardial pacing may be required.
The expertise of a congenital cardiac surgeon is recommended for all
kinds of AVSD defect closures and AV valve repairs.

ESC Guidelines 597


elevation, LVOTO, and arrhythmias. [164] The frequency of outpatient
visits depends on the presence and severity of residual abnormalities.
A patient with a surgically repaired AVSD without significant residual

�
abnormalities should be seen at least every 2 3 years. In the case of

residual abnormalities, the intervals should be shorter.

Indications for reoperation for residual abnormalities are comparable with the indications for primary surgery. In operated patients, the
most frequently occurring problem is left-sided AV valve regurgitation. [165][,][166] It has to be emphasized that these valves are different
from mitral valves and more difficult to repair. Left-sided AV valve
stenosis (most often a result of previous repair) that causes symptoms should be operated on.

4.3.6 Additional considerations

 - [Exercise/sports: for most patients with uncomplicated, repaired]

AVSD, physical activity does not need restriction. Many will,
however, have subnormal exercise performance when measured
objectively. Patients with important residual problems require
individual recommendations (see section 3.5.5).

 - [Pregnancy: well tolerated in patients with complete repair and no]

significant residual lesions. An unoperated partial AVSD increases
the risk of paradoxical embolization. Patients with pre-capillary
PH should be counselled against pregnancy. As a rule, patients
with residual left-sided AV valve regurgitation, who have no indication for surgery, tolerate pregnancy relatively well, although
arrhythmias and worsening of AV valve regurgitation may
occur [167] (see section 3.5.7).

 - [IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see][ sec-]

tion 3.4.6).

4.4 Patent ductus arteriosus

4.4.1 Introduction and background
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the persistent communication
between the proximal left PA and the descending aorta just distal to
the left subclavian artery. It can be associated with a variety of CHD
lesions, however, in adults, it is usually an isolated finding.
PDA originally results in L�R shunt and LV and LA volume overload. In moderate and large PDA, PAP is elevated. In patients who

reach adulthood with a moderate PDA, either LV volume overload

or PAH may be predominant. Adult patients with a large PDA have,
in general, developed Eisenmenger physiology.

4.4.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
Presentations of adult patients with PDA include:

 - [Small duct with no LV volume overload (normal LV) and normal]

PAP (generally asymptomatic).

 - [Moderate PDA with predominant LV volume overload: large LV]

with normal or reduced function (may present with left heart
failure).

 - [Moderate PDA with predominant PAH: pressure-overloaded RV]

(may present with right heart failure).

 - [Large PDA: Eisenmenger physiology with differential hypoxaemia]

and differential cyanosis (lower extremities cyanotic, sometimes
left arm too); see sections 3.4.3 and 3.4.8.
Aneurysm formation of the duct is a very rare complication.

In adults, calcification of the PDA may cause a problem for surgical
closure. Device closure is the method of choice, even if cardiac oper
ations are indicated due to other concomitant cardiac lesions, and

can be successfully performed in the vast majority of adults with a
very low complication rate. [168][�][170] Surgery is reserved for the rare
patient with a duct too large for device closure or with unsuitable
anatomy such as aneurysm formation.

4.4.5 Follow-up recommendations
Echocardiographic evaluation should include LV size and function,

PAP, residual shunt, and associated lesions.

Patients with no residual shunt, normal LV, and normal PAP do not

require regular follow-up after 6 months.
Patients with LV dysfunction and patients with residual PAH
should be followed at intervals of 1�3 years, depending on severity,
including evaluation in specialized ACHD centres.

4.4.6 Additional considerations

 - [Exercise/sports: no restrictions in asymptomatic patients before]

or after intervention without PH; limitation to low-intensity
sports in PAH patients.

 - [Pregnancy: no significantly increased risk for patients without PH.]

Patients with pre-capillary PH should be counselled against pregnancy (see section 3.5.7).

 - [IE prophylaxis: limited to high-risk patients (see][ section 3.4.6][).]

4.5.1 Valvular aortic stenosis

4.5.1.1 Introduction and background
The most common cause for congenital valvular aortic stenosis (AS)
is BAV. Up to 80% of patients with a BAV will develop ascending
aortic dilatation, which is discussed in section 4.7.2. For the manage
ment of AR associated with BAV, see the 2017 ESC/EACTS
Guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease. [25]

4.5.1.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
Patients frequently remain asymptomatic for many years. Progression
of stenosis varies and depends on initial severity, degree of calcification, age, and atherosclerotic risk factors. In BAV, progression is
faster in those patients with greater closure-line eccentricity and an
anteroposterior-oriented line of closure.
Prognosis is good and sudden death is rare in asymptomatic
patients with good exercise tolerance, even when stenosis is
severe. [171]

Once symptoms (angina pectoris, dyspnoea, or syncope) occur,
the prognosis deteriorates rapidly. In patients with BAV, cardiac mortality has been reported to be 0.3% per patient-year of follow-up, the
frequency of aortic dissection 0.03%, and endocarditis 0.3%. Dilated
aortic sinuses and/or ascending aorta have been found in 45% of
patients after 9 years of follow-up. [172]

4.5.1.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles. Diagnostic criteria for degree of

AS are summarized in Table 12.



- [Echocardiography is the key diagnostic technique and provides]

the diagnosis (may be difficult in patients with Eisenmenger physiology), the degree of LV volume overload, PAP, PA size, and right
heart changes.

- [CMR is indicated when additional quantification of LV volumes]

and quantification of shunt (Qp:Qs) is needed.

- [CMR/CCT can further evaluate the anatomy where required.]

- [Cardiac catheterization is required in the case of non-invasive signs]

of PAP elevation (calculated systolic PAP >40 mmHg or indirect
signs when PAP cannot be estimated) to determine PVR. Measurementofpulmonarybloodflowischallenginginthissetting.MeasurementofoxygensaturationinbothleftandrightPAsismandatory.

c Careful individual decision in expert centres is required.


Specific clinical findings include the typical systolic ejection murmur over the aortic valve, radiating into the carotid arteries. An
ejection click can be heard and a thrill may be palpable. The ECG
may show LV hypertrophy (LVH) with or without strain. In
patients diagnosed with a BAV, CoA should be excluded (see section 4.6).

 - [Echocardiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of AS]

and for assessing the degree of calcification, LV function, LVH,
and associated lesions including ascending aortic dilatation. With
Doppler echocardiography, the degree of AS severity is determined from transvalvular peak velocity (V max ), mean gradient,
and continuity equation-calculated aortic valve area (AVA). For

more details, see recent recommendations for the echocardiographic assessment of AS. [173]

 - [TOE may occasionally provide more anatomical details about]

valve dysfunction or AVA planimetry in non-calcified valves.

 - [Exercise testing is recommended in asymptomatic patients, par-]

ticularly in moderate-to-severe AS, to confirm asymptomatic status and evaluate exercise tolerance, blood pressure response,
and arrhythmias for risk stratification and timing of surgery.

 - [Low-dose dobutamine or exercise stress echocardiography is]

helpful in AS with reduced stroke volume and impaired LV function (classical low-flow, low-gradient AS). [173]

Recommendations for intervention in valvular aortic

stenosis




4.5.1.4 Medical therapy
Symptomatic patients require urgent surgery. Medical treatment for
AS-related heart failure is reserved for non-operable patients.
Neither statin treatment, nor any other medical treatment, has so far
been shown to retard progression of AS.





4.5.1.5 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment

Indications for intervention are summarized in the Recommendations

for intervention in valvular aortic stenosis table and in Figure 5.
In selected adolescents and young adults with non-calcified
valves, balloon valvuloplasty may be considered. This may be the
case in haemodynamically unstable patients as a bridge to surgery
or to delay valve replacement in women with anatomically suitable
valves and desire of pregnancy. In patients with calcified valves, the
treatment of choice is valve replacement. Mechanical valves are
more durable than biological valves or homografts but require lifelong anticoagulation. The Ross procedure (two-valve operation)
has been suggested for patients of childbearing age and for those
wanting to avoid anticoagulation. Progressive degeneration of the
homograft after the Ross procedure is the most frequent reason
for reintervention during follow-up. Transcatheter pulmonary
valve implantation has become an alternative technique for surgical treatment of the degenerated pulmonary valve. Transcatheter
aortic valve implantation currently has no place in the treatment
of congenital AS, except in very rare cases with high surgical risk,
when technically feasible.



4.5.1.6 Follow-up recommendations
Lifelong and regular follow-up is required, and the intervals depend
upon the degree of stenosis severity. It is also necessary after valve
intervention at minimum yearly intervals.
Echocardiographic imaging of the aortic valve and aortic root to
determine progression of valve stenosis and aortic dilation is mandatory. CMR or CCT of the aorta is recommended in patients with a
native BAV, patients with a history of isolated valve replacement
where the ascending aorta is not well visualized on TTE, and in
patients with root/ascending diameters >40mm. [176]

4.5.2 Supravalvular aortic stenosis
4.5.2.1 Introduction and background
Supravalvular AS (SupraAS) may occur as a characteristic feature of
Williams�Beuren syndrome or be isolated/familial, which are
respectively caused by deletion of the elastin gene located on chromosome 7q11.23 or a mutation in this same gene. These genetic
defects lead to obstructive arteriopathy of varying severity, which is
most pronounced at the sinotubular junction. [177]

SupraAS may also be encountered in the setting of familial homozygous hypercholesterolaemia. [178] SupraAS occurs as a localized
fibrous diaphragm just distal to the coronary ostia or, most commonly, as an external hourglass deformity with a corresponding luminal narrowing of the aorta, or as diffuse stenosis of the ascending
aorta. It may be associated with aortic valve abnormalities, hypoplasia
of the entire aorta, involvement of coronary ostia, or stenosis of


4.5.2.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
The majority of patients present in childhood with symptoms of either
outflow obstruction or myocardial ischaemia. While progression of
SupraAS is rare in adulthood, adults remain at risk for cardiac complications. [179] Sudden death occurs rarely, but it is more common in

�
SupraAS with Williams Beuren syndrome, with diffuse peripheral PA
stenosis, or with CAD, particularly related to anaesthetic procedures.

4.5.2.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Auscultation typically reveals a loud systolic ejection murmur best
heard at the left lower sternal border without associated ejection

click or diastolic murmur of AR.

 - [Echocardiography enables the anatomic diagnosis of SupraAS]

when the acoustic window allows. Doppler echocardiography
provides pressure gradients, but these may over- or underestimate the actual pressure drop across the obstruction. TOE
allows good visualization of the coronary ostia and 3D TOE can
be used for detailed evaluation of the stenotic region. [180]

 - [For exercise testing, see valvular AS (][section 4.5.1][).]

602 ESC Guidelines



- [CMR/CCT is useful for detailed evaluation of supravalvular anat-]

omy, in particular, when multilevel LVOTO is present or for
(pre-operative) assessment of coronary artery anatomy and
other aortic or aortic branch lesions (e.g. carotid and renal artery
stenosis), and central and branch PAs.

- [Cardiac catheterization: haemodynamic assessment is recom-]

mended when non-invasive quantification remains uncertain.

- [Genetic evaluation, with counselling and subsequent testing using]

�
micro-array techniques to diagnose Williams Beuren syndrome
and sequencing of the elastin gene in non-syndromic presenta
tions, is useful.

4.5.2.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment
Surgery is the primary treatment: the operative mortality rate for
fibrous diaphragm and hourglass deformity is <5%. Since the coronary
arteries are under high pressure, surgery might be considered earlier
than in patients with valvular AS, particularly when no valve substitute is
required. Following operative repair, the survival rate has been reported
to be 80�85% at 20 years. [181] AR may be present in �25% of patients,
but usually it is not progressive after surgical relief of SupraAS.

 - [IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see][ sec-]

tion 3.4.6).

4.5.3 Subaortic stenosis

4.5.3.1 Introduction and background
Subaortic stenosis (SubAS) occurs as an isolated lesion, but is frequently
associated with aortic valve disease, VSD, AVSD, or Shone complex
(multilevel left heart obstruction). It may also develop after repair of
these lesions. It is caused by a fibrous ridge/ring in the LVOT proximal
to the aortic valve or as a fibromuscular narrowing. SubAS has to be differentiated from obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

4.5.3.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
The clinical course is highly variable. The presence of associated
CHD, particularly a VSD, is related with SubAS progression; age
seems not to play a role in disease. AR is frequent but rarely haemodynamically significant or progressive. [182] Although infrequent, sudden
death has been reported in SubAS patients.

4.5.3.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Clinical findings mainly include a systolic ejection murmur at the
left sternal border without systolic ejection click. A diastolic murmur

refers to AR.

 - [Echocardiography visualizes LVOT anatomy, associated aortic]

valve abnormality, degree of AR, LV function, LVH, and associated lesions. With Doppler echocardiography, the severity of the
subvalvular obstruction is determined, but Doppler-derived gradients may overestimate the obstruction and may require confirmation by cardiac catheterization. Occasionally, TOE is
necessary to better demonstrate the membrane or ring. 3D TOE
can be helpful to characterize the complex LVOT anatomy and
estimate the area of obstruction by planimetry.

 - [CMR may be useful to characterize complex LVOTO anatomies,]

especially in patients with poor acoustic window.

4.5.3.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment
Surgical treatment is the only effective intervention and involves a
complete resection of the fibrous ridge/ring and parts of the muscular
base along the left septal surface. Fibromuscular or tunnel-type
SubAS requires more extensive resection or a Konno procedure.
Surgical results are good, but restenosis may occur. In patients with
low surgical risk and morphologically well suited to repair, the thresh
old for intervention is lower than in aortic valve stenosis since no

valve implant is required. In the case of moderate or severe AR, the
aortic valve must be repaired or replaced at the time of surgery.

4.5.3.5 Follow-up recommendations
Lifelong regular follow-up, including echocardiography, is required in
the non-operated state to determine progression of obstruction, AR,
and LV hypertrophy, function, and size. Regular post-operative follow

tion 3.4.6).

4.6 Coarctation of the aorta

4.6.1 Introduction and background
CoA is considered as part of a generalized arteriopathy, and not only
as narrowing of the aorta. It occurs as a discrete stenosis or as a long,



area where the ductus arteriosus inserts, and only in rare cases
occurs ectopically (ascending, descending, or abdominal aorta).
Associated lesions include BAV (up to 85%), ascending aortic
aneurysm, SubAS, or SupraAS, (supra)mitral valve stenosis (including
parachute mitral valve), Shone complex, or complex congenital heart
defects. CoA can be associated with Turner syndrome and
Williams�Beuren syndrome. Extracardiac vascular anomalies have
been reported in CoA patients including anomalous origin of the

�
right subclavian artery (in 4 5% of cases), collateral arterial circulation, and intracerebral aneurysms (in up to 10%).

4.6.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
Signs and symptoms depend on the severity of CoA. Patients with
severe CoA usually present with signs and symptoms early in life,
while particularly mild cases may not become evident until adulthood, where CoA is detected in the work-up of arterial
hypertension.
Key symptoms may include headache, nosebleeds, dizziness,
tinnitus, shortness of breath, abdominal angina, claudication, and cold

feet.

Patients with CoA who reach adolescence demonstrate very good
long-term survival up to age 60 years. Long-term morbidity is common, however, largely related to aortic complications and longstanding hypertension. [183]

The natural course may be complicated by left heart failure, intracranial haemorrhage (from berry aneurysm), IE, aortic rupture/dissection, premature coronary and cerebral artery disease, and

associated heart defects.

4.6.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Office blood pressure measurement in the upper and lower
extremities are the primary studies required in all coarctation
patients. A blood pressure gradient between upper and lower
extremities (systolic >_20 mmHg) indicates significant CoA. Weak or
absent pulses in the lower extremities or radiofemoral pulse delay
also indicate significant coarctation.

 - [Ambulatory blood pressure measurements (right arm) are rec-]

ommended to detect/confirm arterial hypertension (24-h mean
systolic >130 mmHg and/or diastolic >80 mmHg).

 - [Other findings consist of a suprasternal thrill (proximal obstruc-]

tion), an interscapular (systolic) murmur, or continuous murmurs

4.6 Coarctation of the aorta

4.6.1 Introduction and background
CoA is considered as part of a generalized arteriopathy, and not only
as narrowing of the aorta. It occurs as a discrete stenosis or as a long,
hypoplastic aortic (arch) segment. Typically, CoA is located in the

604 ESC Guidelines


Doppler-related pressure recovery. The gradient is then overestimated. A diastolic tail in the descending aorta and diastolic forward flow in the abdominal aorta are findings of significant
(re-)CoA.

 - [CMR and CCT, including 3D reconstruction, are the preferred]

non-invasive techniques to evaluate the entire aorta in adolescents and adults. Both depict site, extent, and degree of the aortic
narrowing, the aortic arch and head and neck vessels, the preand post-stenotic aorta, and collaterals. Both methods detect
complications such as aneurysms, false aneurysms, restenosis, or
residual stenosis. [184]

 - [Imaging of intracerebral vessels is indicated in the case of symp-]

toms and/or clinical manifestations of aneurysms/rupture.

 - [Cardiac catheterization with manometry (a peak-to-peak gra-]

dient >_20 mmHg) indicates a haemodynamically significant CoA
in the absence of well-developed collaterals and is performed in
the setting of interventional treatment. It should be noted that, in
patients under general anaesthesia, invasive measurement of gradient may be underestimated.

4.6.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment

Indications for intervention are summarized in the Recommendations

for intervention in coarctation and re-coarctation of the aorta table and in

Figure 6.
In native CoA, as well as re-coarctation with appropriate anatomy,
stenting has become the first-choice treatment in many ACHD
centres. [185] The use of covered stents is preferred because of lower
short- and long-term complication rates. [186] Biodegradable stents are
in development but are mainly applied in children when the aorta is
still expected to grow.

Balloon angioplasty in adults is only indicated for re-dilatation of
previously stented aortas.
While paediatric surgical techniques include resection and end-to
end anastomosis, resection and extended end-to-end anastomosis,

prosthetic patch aortoplasty, subclavian flap aortoplasty, interposition of a (tube) graft, and bypass tube (jump) grafts, only the latter
two are generally feasible in adults. Ascending-to-descending aorta
conduits may be preferable in adults with difficult anatomy. Although
the surgical risk in simple CoA may currently be <1%, it increases sig
�
nificantly beyond the age of 30 40 years. Spinal cord injury has
become extremely rare. [187]

As coarctation is not a localized disease of the aorta, associated

lesions that may require structural interventions have to be

considered:

 - [Associated significant aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation]

(BAV).

 - [Aneurysm of the ascending aorta with a diameter >50 mm or]

rapid progression of diameter.

 - [Aneurysm and false aneurysms at the previous CoA site.]

 - [Symptomatic or large aneurysms of the circle of Willis.]

Treatment should be performed in centres with extensive experi
ence in the treatment of CHD.

Residua, sequelae, and complications are listed below:

after successful treatment, and is an important risk factor for premature CAD, ventricular dysfunction, and rupture of aortic or
cerebral aneurysms. [188]

 - [The geometry of the arch (gothic, crenel, normal) and smaller]

aortic size in the stented region may play a role in the development of hypertension. Right arm 24-h ambulatory blood pressure
measurement better detects hypertension than a one-off measurement. [189] The significance of isolated, exercise-induced hyper
tension is a matter of debate.

4.7 Aortopathies
4.7.1 Marfan syndrome and related heritable thoracic

aortic diseases

4.7.1.1 Introduction and background
Marfan syndrome is the prototype of syndromic HTAD entities,
comprising a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders with aneurysm or dissection of the thoracic aorta as the common denominator. Both syndromic and non-syndromic (or isolated)
forms of HTAD are part of the clinical spectrum, with notable clinical
overlap between the various entities.
For more details on the various syndromes, please refer to the
2014 ESC Guidelines on aortic disease [193] and a consensus document
on genetic testing in ACHD/HTAD. [140] Since most children with
mainly syndromic forms of HTAD will be transferred to ACHD units
at adult age, these Guidelines focus on specific cardiovascular complications. Marfan syndrome is considered as the model disease �
other syndromes are mentioned in case of important differences
from Marfan syndrome.

606 ESC Guidelines


4.7.1.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
Although thoracic aortic disease � either aneurysms detected by
screening or dissection in an emergency setting � is the principal
characteristic in Marfan syndrome /HTAD, extra-aortic features in
the skeletal/ocular organ system may be the key to diagnosis in some

patients.
Prognosis in all HTAD entities is mainly determined by progressive dilation of the aorta, leading to aortic dissection or rupture.
Prognosis varies according to the underlying genetic defect. The
average age at death in untreated Marfan syndrome patients is
<40 years, but can approach that of the general population in
patients in whom the diagnosis is known and who are properly
managed. [29][,][194] More rare cardiovascular causes of death include
heart failure and SCD. [29]

In Marfan syndrome, the major determinant of type A aortic dissection is the aortic root diameter with increased risk of rupture >_50
mm. [195] Other risk factors include family history of aortic dissection
at low diameter, [193] aortic root growth rate, pregnancy, and hypertension. Increasing evidence for gene-based differences in aortic risk
are emerging and need to be considered. Other parts of the aorta �
or in the case of some entities, major branching vessels � may also

dilate or dissect.

The presence of significant aortic, tricuspid, or mitral regurgitation � usually related to valve prolapse � may lead to symptoms
of ventricular volume overload. However, LV disease may also
occur independently of valvular dysfunction and this may be associated with arrhythmia. Mitral valve prolapse in patients with
Marfan syndrome manifests early and progresses to severe regurgitation, need for surgery, and IE earlier than idiopathic mitral
valve prolapse. [196]

4.7.1.3 Diagnostic work-up
Early identification and establishment of the correct diagnosis is critical since prophylactic surgery can prevent aortic dissection and rupture. This requires a multidisciplinary team approach with integration
of clinical and genetic findings. [197] The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome
is based on the Ghent criteria, with aortic root aneurysm/dissection
and ectopia lentis as cardinal features. [198] Criteria for the other

HTAD entities are less well defined.

Gene panel testing is meaningful for confirmation of the diagnosis
and to guide management. Mutation pick-up rate in syndromic forms
is higher (>90%) than in non-syndromic entities (20�30%). [199] Once
a pathogenic variant is identified, presymptomatic genetic screening
of family members is mandatory to allow early and appropriate

management.

 - [Echocardiographic assessment of the aortic root should]

include measurements at the annulus, sinus, sinotubular junction, distal ascending, arch, and descending thoracic aortic levels. In adults, measurement at end diastole using the leadingto-leading edge principle is recommended. The values
obtained should be corrected for the individual’s age, sex, and
body size using standardized nomograms. [200][,][201] Valvular morphology (mitral valve prolapse, BAV) and function must be

obtained should be corrected for the individual’s age, sex, and
body size using standardized nomograms. [200][,][201] Valvular morphology (mitral valve prolapse, BAV) and function must be
assessed, as well as the presence of a PDA. LV dimension and


function should be addressed according to standard

recommendations.

 - [CMR or CCT angiography from head to pelvis should be per-]

formed in every patient at baseline, providing imaging of the
entire aorta and branching vessels. In addition to measuring
aortic diameters, information on aortic/vertebral artery tortuosity is important for diagnostic and prognostic
purposes. [202][,][203]

 - [Holter monitoring should be performed in symptomatic patients,]

as ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and SCD

can occur.

4.7.1.4 Medical therapy
Although no reduction in mortality or dissection rate has been
established in any trial, beta blockers remain the mainstay for
medical treatment in Marfan/HTAD patients, reducing wall shear
stress and aortic growth rate. [204] Rigorous antihypertensive medical treatment aimed at a 24-h ambulatory systolic blood pressure
<130 mmHg (110 mmHg in patients with aortic dissection) is
important, although there are no data to establish outright blood
pressure thresholds. ARBs did not prove to have a superior effect
when compared with beta blockers or in addition to beta blockers
in several trials, but may be considered as an alternative in patients
intolerant to beta blockers. [205][,][206] Medical treatment should be

continued after surgery.

Ongoing meta-analyses of medical treatment trials may help define
subgroups � based on genetic and clinical data � who benefit from
specific treatment. [207] Since no medical trials have been conducted in
non-Marfan HTAD, medical treatment is usually adopted from

Marfan data.

4.7.1.5 Surgical treatment

Indications for intervention are summarized in the

Recommendations for aortic surgery in aortopathies table.
Prophylactic aortic root surgery is the only definitive treatment
for the prevention of aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome and
related HTADs. In patients with anatomically normal aortic valves
and low-grade regurgitation, a valve-sparing aortic root replacement by a Dacron prosthesis and reimplantation of the coronary
arteries into the prosthesis (David procedure) has become the
preferred surgical procedure with good long-term outcome,
including in Marfan patients. [193][,][208] Composite graft replacement,
usually with a mechanical valve, is a more durable alternative but
does require lifelong anticoagulation. The decision on which technique to use should be made on an individual basis, and patient
preferences and surgical experience should be taken into
account. [209]

Marfan and related HTADs are associated with a risk of re
dissection and recurrent aneurysm in the distal aorta, especially in
patients with previous dissection. [210][,][211] With improved life expectancy, these complications now occur more frequently. Open aortic
surgery remains the reference method for treatment of distal aortic
disease, although hybrid procedures with endovascular stenting �
where proximal and distal landing is possible in a Dacron tube �

could be considered in selected cases.

ESC Guidelines 607


4.7.1.6 Follow-up recommendations
Lifelong and regular multidisciplinary follow-up at an expert centre is
required. Echocardiography and CCT/CMR are the principal

examinations.

4.7.1.7 Additional considerations

 - [Exercise/sports: patients should be advised to avoid exertion at]

maximal capacity, competitive, contact, and isometric sports.
Risk estimation based on aortic size has been suggested by Budts
et al. [24]

 - [Pregnancy: in genetically confirmed Marfan/HTAD, there is a]

50% transmission risk for both men and women. Proper and
timely genetic counselling is needed. Women with an aortic
root diameter >45 mm are strongly discouraged from becoming pregnant without prior repair because of the increased risk
of dissection. [43] An aortic root diameter <40 mm rarely
presents a problem, although a completely safe diameter does
not exist. With an aortic root 40�45 mm, previous aortic
growth and family history are important factors when considering repair prior to pregnancy. After repair of the ascending
aorta, Marfan patients remain at risk for dissection of the
residual aorta (see section 3.5.7).

 - [IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see][ sec-]

tion 3.4.6).

4.7.2 Bicuspid aortic disease

�
Depending on the reported series, 20 84% of patients with a BAV
will develop ascending aortic dilatation, [212] indicating that BAV should
be regarded as part of a spectrum of valvluo-aortopathy and that
bicuspid aortic disease may be a more appropriate term. Although
the relative contribution of intrinsic/genetic wall abnormalities and
altered haemodynamics remains debated, both factors are probably

involved.

In the absence of significant valvular dysfunction, aortic
dilatation in the setting of bicuspid aortic disease typically evolves
asymptomatically. With increasing diameters, however, the
risk for acute aortic dissection rises. Compared with the general
population, the dissection incidence in bicuspid aortic
disease patients is eight times higher, which is in absolute numbers still a low risk (31/100 000 patient years) [172][,][176][,][213] and much

lower than in Marfan/HTAD. Observational studies indicate that

the clinical outcome in bicuspid aortic disease patients is
more similar to that of the general population with aneurysms
and represents a more benign aortopathy than Marfan/
HTAD. [176][,][214]

CoA is associated with an increased risk for dissection. [215]

For diagnostic work-up see section 4.7.1.3.

To this date, no evidence for medical treatment of aortic dilatation



reasonable to consider beta blockers or ARBs as first-line treatment

for arterial hypertension.

Indications for intervention are summarized in the

Recommendations for aortic surgery in aortopathies table.
Familial occurrence of BAV has clearly been established with
rates of 5�10% in first-degree relatives in various studies. [216]

Echocardiographic screening in first-degree relatives of BAV
patients is recommended and may be appropriate,
particularly in boys, in athletes, and if hypertension is present.
Rare pathogenic variants in a number of genes account for <5%
of all bicuspid aortic disease cases and routine genetic testing in
this setting is not indicated but may be considered in familial
cases. [140]

There are no data on the risk for dissection related to pregnancy
in women with a dilated aorta. According to the 2018 ESC
Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease during
pregnancy, [43] women should be counselled against pregnancy when

the aortic diameter is >50 mm.

For treatment of AR, see 2017 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on the
management of valvular heart disease. [25]

4.7.3 Turner syndrome
Turner syndrome is caused by a partial or complete monosomy of
the X-chromosome and occurs in 1 in 2500 live-born females. [217]

Turner syndrome is associated with short stature, delayed puberty, ovarian dysgenesis, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, infertility, congenital malformations of the heart, diabetes mellitus,
osteoporosis, and autoimmune disorders. CHD, occurring in
approximately 50% of women with Turner syndrome, includes a
high incidence of BAV, CoA, partial anomalous pulmonary venous
connection, left SVC, elongated transverse aortic arch, dilatation
of the brachiocephalic arteries, and aortic dilatation. Given this
high prevalence of abnormalities, every woman with Turner syndrome should be seen by a cardiologist at least once. [217] Even in
the absence of CHD, all individuals with Turner syndrome have a
generalized arteriopathy and Turner syndrome alone is an independent risk factor for thoracic aortic dilation. Aortic dissection
(both type A and type B) occurs in approximately 40 per 100 000
person-years compared with 6 per 100 000 person-years in the
general population. [218]

For diagnostic work-up see section 4.7.1.3.

Indications for intervention are summarized in the

Recommendations for aortic surgery in aortopathies table.
With advances in assisted reproductive technology and oocyte
donation, an increasing number of women with Turner syndrome
are now able to become pregnant. The presence of aortic dilatation
and CHD increases the risks of pregnancy and Turner syndrome
women are also at increased risk of hypertensive disorders, including
pre-eclampsia. All women with Turner syndrome should be counselled about the increased cardiovascular risk of pregnancy and fertility treatment. [43]

Recommendations for aortic surgery in aortopathies





- [Sub-infundibular stenosis, or DCRV, is commonly associated]

with a VSD. It is caused by narrowing between prominent and
hypertrophied muscle bands or ridges that separate the hypertrophied, high-pressure inlet and apical portions from a lowpressure, non-hypertrophied and non-obstructive infundibular
portion of the RV. [219]

- [Infundibular stenosis usually occurs in combination with other]

lesions, particularly VSD, TOF, and secondary to valvular pulmonary stenosis (PS) (reactive myocardial hypertrophy). At the

infundibular level, and to some extent the sub-infundibular level,

the obstruction tends to be dynamic, meaning that the orifice
narrows during systole.

- [Valvular PS is usually an isolated lesion. Mainly due to intrinsic]

wall abnormalities, and independent of haemodynamics, dilation
of the PA may occur. Most often, there is a typical dome-shaped
pulmonary valve with a narrow central opening but a preserved
mobile valve base. A dysplastic pulmonary valve, with poorly
mobile cusps and myxomatous thickening, is less common

�
(15 20%; even less in untreated adults) and frequently part of
Noonan syndrome. In adults, a stenotic pulmonary valve may calcify late in life.

- [Supravalvular PS, or pulmonary arterial stenosis, is caused by]

narrowing of the main pulmonary trunk, pulmonary arterial
bifurcation, or pulmonary branches. It seldom occurs in isola
�
tion, and may occur in Williams Beuren syndrome, Noonan
syndrome, congenital rubella syndrome, or Alagille syndrome.
The stenosis may be located in the main branches or more
peripherally; it may be discrete or diffuse (hypoplastic) or
there may be frank occlusion, and it may occur as single or
multiple stenoses. Stenosis may be secondary to previous
placement of a PA band or at a previous shunt site. A diameter
narrowing >_50% is usually considered to be significant and
would be expected to have a pressure gradient and result in
hypertension in the proximal PA.

4.8 Right ventricular outflow tract
obstruction

4.8.1 Introduction and background

RVOTO can occur at the sub-infundibular, infundibular, valvular, or

supravalvular levels.

  - [Sub-infundibular stenosis, or DCRV, is commonly associated]

with a VSD. It is caused by narrowing between prominent and
hypertrophied muscle bands or ridges that separate the hypertrophied, high-pressure inlet and apical portions from a lowpressure, non-hypertrophied and non-obstructive infundibular
portion of the RV. [219]

  - [Infundibular stenosis usually occurs in combination with other]

lesions, particularly VSD, TOF, and secondary to valvular pulmonary stenosis (PS) (reactive myocardial hypertrophy). At the

infundibular level, and to some extent the sub-infundibular level,

the obstruction tends to be dynamic, meaning that the orifice
narrows during systole.

  - [Valvular PS is usually an isolated lesion. Mainly due to intrinsic]

wall abnormalities, and independent of haemodynamics, dilation
of the PA may occur. Most often, there is a typical dome-shaped
pulmonary valve with a narrow central opening but a preserved
mobile valve base. A dysplastic pulmonary valve, with poorly
mobile cusps and myxomatous thickening, is less common

�
(15 20%; even less in untreated adults) and frequently part of
Noonan syndrome. In adults, a stenotic pulmonary valve may calcify late in life.

  - [Supravalvular PS, or pulmonary arterial stenosis, is caused by]

narrowing of the main pulmonary trunk, pulmonary arterial
bifurcation, or pulmonary branches. It seldom occurs in isola
�
tion, and may occur in Williams Beuren syndrome, Noonan
syndrome, congenital rubella syndrome, or Alagille syndrome.
The stenosis may be located in the main branches or more
peripherally; it may be discrete or diffuse (hypoplastic) or
there may be frank occlusion, and it may occur as single or
multiple stenoses. Stenosis may be secondary to previous
placement of a PA band or at a previous shunt site. A diameter
narrowing >_50% is usually considered to be significant and
would be expected to have a pressure gradient and result in
hypertension in the proximal PA.

4.8.2 Clinical presentation and natural history

  - [Sub-infundibular/infundibular: adult patients with DCRV may be]

asymptomatic or they may present with dyspnoea, chest discomfort, dizziness, or syncope during exertion. The degree of
obstruction is progressive over time. [220]

  - [Valvular: patients with mild-to-moderate valvular PS are usually]

asymptomatic. Mild valvular PS in unoperated adults is usually not
progressive. [221] Moderate PS can progress at the valvular level (calcification) or at the subvalvular level due to reactive myocardial
hypertrophy. Patients with severe stenosis may present with dyspnoea and reduced exercise capacity and have a worse prognosis.

  - [Supravalvular: patients may be asymptomatic or have symptoms of]

dyspnoea and reduced exercise capacity. They are usually recognized in the context of certain syndromes or in patients referred for

dyspnoea and reduced exercise capacity. They are usually recognized in the context of certain syndromes or in patients referred for
suspicion of PH. Peripheral PA stenosis may progress in severity.

ESC Guidelines 609


4.8.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Clinical findings include a harsh systolic murmur across the
obstruction and wide splitting of the second heart sound. In peripheral PS, the systolic murmur is typically heard over the lung fields.

 - [Echocardiography: size, shape, and function of the RV can be]

assessed and the exact position/level of the RVOTO can be
visualized, as well as pulmonary valve, main PA, and proximal PA
branches. For quantification of RV sizes, volumes, and EF, CMR is
a more robust and more reliable technique. Doppler ultrasound

is used for measurements of flow velocities across an obstruction

to assess severity. Correlation between flow velocities and pressure gradients is only good in the case of discrete stenosis, e.g.
isolated valvular PS. In the presence of normal RV function and

normal transvalvular flow, RVOTO is considered mild when the

peak gradient across the obstruction is <36 mmHg, moderate if
36�64 mmHg, and severe when the gradient is >64 mmHg. If
the narrowing is elongated, or if more than one stenosis is
present in series (e.g. subvalvular and valvular), application of the
Bernoulli equation will lead to an overestimation of the pressure
gradient. Doppler flow velocity of TR then gives a more reliable
estimation of RV pressures � and with that, severity of the
RVOTO � than the flow velocity across the RVOTO. Gradients
only represent severity of an obstruction if a good systolic RV
function is present. In a low-flow, low-gradient situation, it is very
difficult to assess severity of a RVOTO. [222]

 - [CMR and CCT frequently provide additional important informa-]

tion identifying the level(s) of obstruction, including at the subinfundibular (DCRV), conduit, or branch PA levels, and assessment of RV volumes, pulmonary annulus, outflow tract and
artery dimensions, and differential pulmonary blood flow. CMR
and CCT are the methods of choice for visualization of pulmonary dilation and peripheral PS.

 - [Cardiac catheterization may be required to confirm the extent,]

severity, and level of obstruction (e.g. DCRV).

4.8.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment
Catheter-based balloon valvotomy is recommended for patients
with non-dysplastic valvular PS and with peripheral PS (often with
stent implantation). [223] Surgery is recommended for patients with
sub-infundibular or infundibular PS and hypoplastic pulmonary annulus, with dysplastic pulmonary valves, and for patients with associated
lesions which need a surgical approach, such as severe pulmonary
regurgitation (PR) or severe TR. Peripheral PS can rarely be
addressed with surgery.

Both surgical and catheter interventions should only be performed
in centres specialized in CHD.
In patients with subvalvular, valvular, and supravalvular PS, a markedly dilated pulmonary trunk may be present. Rupture is extremely
rare in these low-pressure, highly elastic vessels and these pulmonary
aneurysms generally do not require intervention. [224]

For RV�PA conduit, see section 4.14.

Indications for intervention are summarized in the

Recommendations for intervention in right ventricular outflow tract obstruction table and in Figure 7.

4.8.5 Follow-up recommendations
Patients with RVOTO need lifelong follow-up with regular echocardiographic imaging. The frequency of follow-up depends on the
severity of the lesion, but most patients will need a yearly visit, including evaluation in specialized ACHD centres except for patients with
mild or well repaired valvular stenosis. After surgical or catheter
intervention, a residual PR may need reintervention later in life for
patients who become symptomatic or when progressive RV dilatation or dysfunction occurs (see section 4.10). Patients with mild valvular or mild residual PS need to be seen only once in 5 years.

4.9 Ebstein anomaly
4.9.1 Introduction and background
Ebstein anomaly is characterized by abnormally formed and apically
displaced leaflets of the TV. The anterior leaflet usually originates at
the annular level but is enlarged and sail-like, while the septal and posterior leaflets are displaced towards the RV apex and often tethered

to the endocardium.

The apical displacement of the TV means that the right heart consists of a morphological RA, an atrialized portion of the RV, and the
remaining functional RV; the TV is often regurgitant.
The most frequently associated anomalies include a shunt at the
atrial level [secundum ASD or patent foramen ovale (PFO)] and


Multiple accessory pathways in conjunction with AT and AF are associated with SCD. Ebstein-like anomaly of the systemic TV is present

in one-third of ccTGA.

Haemodynamic changes depend on the severity of the TV dysfunction, the degree of atrialization of the RV, contractility of the remaining functional RV and the systemic ventricle, type and severity of
concomitant anomalies, and arrhythmias.
The pathophysiology is characterized by systolic regurgitation

of blood from the functional RV, across the TV, and into the

atrialized ventricle or RA, which tend to dilate. An interatrial connec
tion permits a L�R shunt or, especially during exercise, a R�L shunt.
Ebstein anomaly may result in a chronically low systemic cardiac

output.

4.9.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
The clinical presentation ranges from trivial symptoms to the presentation of a profound cyanotic heart defect. Patients with mild forms
can be asymptomatic over decades until they are diagnosed. Typical
complications include high-grade TR, RV dysfunction, RV failure, liver
cirrhosis, cerebral abscesses, paradoxical embolism, pulmonary
embolism, tachyarrhythmias, SCD, and IE. Key symptoms are
arrhythmias [atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) is most

ESC Guidelines 611


common], dyspnoea, fatigue, poor exercise tolerance, chest pain, and
peripheral and/or central cyanosis.

4.9.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Clinical findings may include cyanosis and hepatomegaly.
Auscultation findings include a widely split first sound and second
sound, serial clicks, third and fourth sound, and a systolic murmur
from TR. ECG may show RA hypertrophy, a prolonged PR
interval, right bundle branch block (often with a splintered QRS com
�
plex), deep Q in II, III, aVF, and V1 V4, pre-excitation, low voltage,
multiple pathways (AVRT), and supraventricular and ventricular
arrhythmias.

 - [Chest X-ray is helpful to follow changes in the heart’s size.]

 - [Echocardiography provides information on: anatomy and func-]

tion of the TV; apical distal displacement of the septal or posterior leaflet (in adults >_0.8 cm/m [2] BSA); size of the anterior leaflet;
tethering of the septal or posterior TV leaflet on the septum or

ventricular wall; size and function of the different cardiac sections

(RA, atrialized ventricle, remaining functional RV, and LV); and

RVOTO and associated lesions.

 - [CMR has value with regards to prognostication] [225] [, and for evalu-]

ation before and after surgery, as it offers unrestricted views for
assessment and quantification of the dilated right heart, RV func
tion, and TV function.

4.9.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment
Clinical symptoms determine the treatment. Conservative therapy can
alleviate symptoms temporarily and create a beneficial basis for the following operation. [226] Oral anticoagulation is recommended for patients
with a history of paradoxical embolism or AF. In the presence of an
increased thromboembolic risk or a R�L shunt, oral anticoagulation
may be considered. Symptomatic rhythm disorders can be treated
conservatively or, preferably, with EP intervention. [227] Transcatheter
access to right-sided accessory pathways and the slow pathway in AV
node reentry may be hindered by TV surgery, such that it may be reasonable to assess for arrhythmia substrates and proceed with catheter
ablation, if identified, before surgery. Occasionally, there may be an

indication to close the atrial communication in isolation. However, this

needs to be discussed carefully, as it may lead to a further increase in
right heart pressures and a decrease in systemic cardiac output.
Surgical repair remains challenging and should only be performed by
surgeons with specific experience in this lesion. TV repair, if feasible, is
preferred over TV replacement (with closure of an associated interatrial communication). If the RV is too small for repair or RV dysfunction
has developed, an additional bidirectional cavopulmonary (Glenn)
anastomosis may be considered in adults with preserved LV function
when LA pressure and LV end diastolic pressure are not elevated. [228]

In patients with failed repair, or in severe biventricular dysfunction,
heart transplantation may be the only option.

The previously high operative mortality (>25%) has fallen to <6%
in specialized centres. Over 90% of patients operated on by an experienced surgeon survive >10 years, many in functional class I or II.
Late fatalities are probably due to arrhythmias. In a large series, survival free of late reoperation was 86%, 74%, 62%, and 46% at 5, 10,
15, and 20 years, respectively. [229]

4.9.5 Follow-up recommendations
Regular follow-up (at least yearly) is required in all patients in specialized ACHD centres. Typical post-operative residual anomalies to
look for are persisting or new TR, the usual complications after valve
replacement, failure of RV or LV, residual atrial shunts, arrhythmias,
and higher-grade AV blocks.

isometric exercises, in proportion to the severity of their problems.

- [Pregnancy: asymptomatic females with good ventricular function]

may tolerate pregnancy well. There is a certain risk of RV failure,
arrhythmia, and paradoxical embolism. Pregnancy will be of
higher risk in the presence of significant cyanosis, serious arrhythmia, and right heart failure (see section 3.5.7).

4.10 Tetralogy of Fallot
4.10.1 Introduction and background
TOF is characterized by the following four features: a nonrestrictive VSD; overriding aorta (but <50%); infundibular, valvular, supravalvular RVOTO and/or branch PA stenosis; and consequent RV hypertrophy (RVH). TOF populations can be subdivided
into syndromic patients (�20%, such as: microdeletion 22q11,
trisomy 21, Alagille, Noonan, Williams, and Klippel Feil) and nonsyndromic patients (which represent the vast majority). [230] The
standardized mortality rate among patients with repaired TOF is
almost twice as high as among patients with simple defects (ASD
and VSD). [231]

4.10.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
Surgical repair of TOF has evolved over time, with relief of the
RVOTO usually involving infundibulotomy, resection of obstructive
muscle bundles, and the use of a patch to enlarge the pathway from
the RV to the PAs. In some patients, a palliative shunt procedure � in
order to increase pulmonary blood flow � has been performed
before repair. Common complications in adulthood are:

- [PR: significant PR is almost always encountered following a transan-]

nular patch repair. PR is usually well tolerated for years. Severe
chronic PR, however, eventually leads to symptomatic RV dilation
and dysfunction. [232] The severity of PR and its deleterious long-term
effects are augmented by co-existing distal PA stenoses or PAH.

- [Residual RVOTO can occur at the infundibulum, at the level of the]

pulmonary valve and main pulmonary trunk, and into the branches
of the left and right PA. Elevated RV pressure and RVH have been
described as independent risk factors for poor outcome and a
decreased exercise performance, despite smaller RV volumes [233] .

- [Residual VSD can be due to partial patch dehiscence or failure of]

complete closure at the time of surgery; it may lead to LV volume

overload.

- [Aortic complications may occur many years after the initial surgi-]

cal repair and include progressive aortic dilation and AR (rarely
aortic dissection). The underlying mechanism is incompletely
understood, and may include ascending aorta dilation, abnormal
aortic elasticity, or type of surgical repair [234] .

- [RV and LV dysfunction/heart failure: RV dilation is usually due to]

residual longstanding free PR ± RVOTO. Significant TR may
occur as a consequence of RV dilation, which begets more RV
dilation. LV dilatation may result from longstanding palliative arterial shunts, residual VSDs, and/or AR. Both RV and LV dysfunction may be due to longstanding cyanosis before repair and/or


ventricular�ventricular interactions, electromechanical dyssynchrony, [235][,][236] and coronary artery abnormalities. A reduced LV
free wall longitudinal strain has been reported despite preserved
LVEF. [237] The incidence of clinical heart failure, with its typical
signs and symptoms, increases significantly with age. [238]

Underlying mechanisms may also be: damage to myocardium,
sequelae from surgical repair strategies, or electrical conduction
abnormalities. Management strategies effective in acquired heart
disease are frequently applied in these patients, although its effectiveness for RV failure remains uncertain. [239]

 - [Atrial/ventricular arrhythmias and SCD: arrhythmias and sud-]

den death are important late complications. The estimated
lifetime prevalence of atrial arrhythmias is 20%. IART involving
the cavotricuspid isthmus and RA incision are related to RA
enlargement, whereas AF is facilitated by LA dilatation.
Ventricular arrythmias encompass polymorphic VT/VF, typically related to severely impaired RV and LV function, and
monomorphic sustained VT, which are particularly relevant in
rTOF. [34] Although both polymorphic VT/VF and monomorphic VT can lead to SCD, with a reported frequency of
1�3.5% in retrospective studies, [32] the different underlying
ventricular arrhythmia substrates need to be recognized for
risk stratification and treatment. LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, and ventricular and atrial tachyarrhythmias are predictive of death and sustained VT in adults with rTOF. [240]

Possible risk factors associated with any ventricular arrhythmia and SCD in rTOF are QRS duration >_180 ms, LV systolic
or diastolic dysfunction, and inducible VT at EP testing. Older
age at PVRep and pre-PVRep RVH and dysfunction may be
predictive of shorter time to post-operative death and sustained ventricular arrhythmia. [241] The dominant substrates for
monomorphic VT are anatomically defined isthmuses, bordered by unexcitable tissue. Isthmus dimension and conduction properties can be evaluated by catheter mapping and
likely determine susceptibility to arrhythmias. Targeting the
anatomical isthmuses by catheter ablation has been highly
effective to control VT. [242] Whether catheter mapping can
contribute to individualized risk stratification requires further

investigation.

 - [Endocarditis can be encountered after both surgical and per-]

cutaneous PVRep. Valve-containing prosthetics are an important independent risk factor for IE in the short- and long-term
after implantation, whereas non-valve-containing prosthetics
are a risk factor only during the first 6 months after
implantation. [76]

A schematic overview of long-term complications after repair of
TOF is provided in Figure 8.

4.10.3 Diagnostic work-up of repaired patients
See section 3.3 for general principles.

 - [Clinical findings mostly include a wide split in the second heart]

sound. A low-pitched early ending diastolic murmur suggests
severe PR. A long, loud ejection systolic murmur indicates
RVOTO, a high-pitched diastolic murmur indicates AR, and a
pansystolic murmur indicates a residual VSD.

tant for the assessment of the spatial relationship with the RVOT

going catheter-based interventions (i.e. relief of distal PA stenosis,

visualize the coronary arteries, which is important to assess the
spatial relationship with the RVOT prior to TPVI.

4.10.4 Late surgical/catheter interventional treatment
PVRep and/or relief of RVOTO can be performed with low mortality risk in patients without heart failure and/or advanced ventricular dysfunction. [246] PR is the most frequent reason for
consideration of surgery. Optimal timing remains challenging.
Longitudinal data are more important than single measurements
to assist timing for reintervention. [247] Normalization of RV size
after reintervention becomes unlikely as soon as the end systolic
index exceeds 80 mL/m [2] and the end diastolic volume index
exceeds 160 mL/m [2], [248][�][250] but this cut-off for reintervention may
not correlate with clinical benefit. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that PVRep can improve symptoms and reduce RV volume, but a survival benefit still needs to be shown. [251]

Distal PA stenosis must be addressed, either at the time of surgery
(including intra-operative stenting) or with a percutaneous approach.
A biological pulmonary valve (xenograft or homograft) seems to

have a mean lifespan of 10 20 years, [248][,][252][,][253] and future replacement could be performed by transcatheter valve-in-valve

614 ESC Guidelines


procedures. There is little experience with mechanical valves in this
setting and there is concern about adequate anticoagulation.

Indications for TV annuloplasty, closure of residual VSDs, and/or
aortic root dilation/AR surgery should also be addressed at the time
of surgery. The indication for aortic root surgery does not differ from
the general population. [254]

TPVI techniques have become an alternative to open heart surgery
primarily in patients with RVOT conduit stenosis/regurgitation, but
also in selected patients with native RVOT regurgitation/stenosis.
TPVI, when technically feasible, provides outcomes comparable to
surgical PVRep and is intended to extend the lifetime of a conduit,
hence reducing the number of reoperations during a patient’s lifetime. [255] Stent fracture � the initially most common complication �
has become less of a problem with careful preparation of the ‘landing
zone’ using additional stents. Best long-term results were reported
when a residual gradient of <15 mmHg could be achieved. [256]

Uncommon complications, occurring in <2% of patients, include conduit rupture and coronary artery compression. The risk of endocardi
tis after TPVI remains a concern with an annual incidence rate of
2�3%. [257][,][258] Since coronary artery compression may be lifethreatening, a balloon test to exclude potential coronary artery compression must be performed prior to TPVI, although this test carries
a risk for conduit rupture. In case of severe circumscript conduit calcification, TPVI should only be performed if a CCT scan shows sufficient distance between the conduit and the coronary arteries. The
strong link between slowly conducting anatomical isthmuses and sustained monomorphic VT, and the potential loss of accessibility to the
anatomical isthmus by catheter ablation after surgical PVRep or after
transcutaneous insertion of valves in patch augmented RVOTs, has
important implications for patients who undergo reinterventions. [259]

Whether pre-interventional mapping and preventive ablation of
slowly conducting anatomical isthmuses before or during intervention in patients without documented spontaneous sustained VT is
beneficial is under investigation.

An ICD should be implanted for secondary prevention of SCD
(patients with cardiac arrest or sustained VT) (IC recommendation).
ICD implantation for primary prevention remains controversial, and
no ideal risk stratification scheme has so far been developed. Patients
with unexplained syncope and impaired ventricular function or other
risk factors for SCD should undergo haemodynamic and EP evaluation. In the absence of a reversible cause, ICD implantation should be
considered (see section 3.4.2). [260][,][261]

ESC Guidelines 615


4.10.6 Follow-up recommendations
All patients with TOF should have periodic cardiac follow-up in a specialized ACHD centre, which � in most patients � should be done
annually. Follow-up evaluation needs to look for the complications
listed in section 4.10.2. All patients should have CMR at regular intervals, dependent on the pathology found.

4.10.7 Additional considerations

 - [Exercise/sports: there are no restrictions in asymptomatic]

repaired patients with good haemodynamics. Patients at high risk
for clinical arrhythmia/SCD, patients with advanced biventricular
dysfunction, and patients with marked ascending aortopathy
should be limited to low-intensity activity/sports and avoid iso
metric exercise.

 - [Pregnancy: in unrepaired patients constitutes a considerable risk]

of maternal and foetal complications and death. The risk of pregnancy in repaired patients depends on their haemodynamic status (low in patients with good haemodynamics). In patients with
significant residual lesions, there is a risk of arrhythmia and right
heart failure. Pregnancy is unlikely to have an adverse long-term
effect on cardiovascular function [262] (see section 3.5.7).

 - [IE prophylaxis: recommended only for high-risk patients (see][ sec-]

tion 3.4.6).

4.11 Pulmonary atresia with ventricular
septal defect
4.11.1 Introduction and background
Adult patients with pulmonary atresia with VSD are a heterogeneous
population in terms of underlying anatomy, physiology, and previous
interventions. Pulmonary atresia þ VSD patients share the intracardiac anatomy of TOF but lack a direct communication between the
RV and PAs. Microdeletion 22q11.2 is common (facial anomalies,
nasal speech, and developmental delay). [263] PA supply varies in pulmonary atresia þ VSD, and determines both clinical presentation and
management (the complexity of the pulmonary vascular bed may
make repair unattractive or impossible).

Patients with discordant cardiac connections and/or a single ventricle physiology and their management will be discussed in the

appropriate sections.
There are three patterns of PAs:

 - [Unifocal with confluent, good-sized PAs supplied by a PDA.]

 - [Multifocal, with confluent but hypoplastic PAs (‘seagull’ appear-]

ance) supplied by multiple MAPCAs.

 - [Multifocal with non-confluent or absent PAs supplied by]

MAPCAs.

Surgical management is a heavily debated topic due to the lack of
consensus on the optimal treatment.
Patients with confluent, good-sized PAs and a pulmonary trunk
(usually with valvular atresia) are suitable for a Fallot-like repair using
a transannular patch. Patients with good-sized PAs but without a pulmonary trunk should undergo repair with a RV�PA conduit. Patients



reconstruction of the RVOT (without VSD closure), which may
enhance PA growth, and then be reviewed at a later stage for repair
using a valved conduit. Patients with non-confluent PAs with
adequate, but not excessive, pulmonary blood flow in infancy can survive into adulthood without surgery. There are proponents of a
staged unifocalization approach for this latter challenging group of
infants, ultimately aiming for a conduit repair. [264]

4.11.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
At adult age, clinical presentation for repaired patients is similar to
those with TOF (see sections 4.10 and 4.14). Unrepaired patients
present with exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, and progressive chronic
cyanosis, due to decreased pulmonary blood flow from collateral
stenosis, PA stenosis, increased PVR, or increasing ventricular end
diastolic pressures. [265] Cyanosis will eventually lead to multiorgan
involvement (see section 3.4.8). A number of complications may
occur in unrepaired patients:

 - [Haemoptysis may be due to rupture of usually small collateral]

vessels and/or small PA thrombosis.

 - [Chronic heart failure is usually multifactorial and may be due to]

chronic cyanosis, early excessive pulmonary blood flow,
increased PVR, RV dysfunction, AR, and other causes.

 - [Progressive dilation of the ascending aorta with increasing AR]

(rarely aortic dissection).

 - [Endocarditis can be particularly compromising in patients with]

limited cardiovascular reserve and those with significant cyanosis.

 - [Arrhythmia and SCD are not uncommon.]

 - [Segmental PAH.] [46]

4.11.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.

 - [Clinical findings: cyanosis in unrepaired patients may be profound,]

even with minimal physical effort. Continuous murmurs at the
back suggest MAPCAs. ECG findings include right-axis deviation
and RVH. Chest X-ray may show a boot-shaped cardiac contour
(‘empty PA bay’) with abnormal, decreased pulmonary vascularity (alternating with some areas of increased vascularity through
large MAPCAs).

 - [Echocardiography: findings in repaired patients depend on the]

type of repair (see sections 4.10 and 4.14). For unrepaired
patients, absence of direct flow from the RV to PA, with continuous flow on multiple sites on colour Doppler from the MAPCAs,
may be seen. 3D echocardiography can further aid in delineating
anatomic pathology and biventricular size and function. TOE is
useful in certain patients to evaluate valve anatomy when transthoracic imaging is challenging or when IE is suspected. [266]

 - [CMR, CCT, and cardiac catheterization are required to deter-]

mine sources of pulmonary blood supply and size of PAs, to
assess MAPCAs, and obtain haemodynamics. In repaired patients,
CMR is used for requirements similar to patients with TOF [for
RV volumes and function, PR, size, shape, and expansion of the
PAs, and the size of the ascending aorta, and for residual shunt
(Qp:Qs)]. 3D rotational angiography and 3D overlay imaging, as

Surgical/catheter interventional treatment
For follow-up and intervention in patients with Fallot-like repair with
transannular patch, see section 4.10; for patients with repair using a

�PA conduit, see section 4.14.

Patients with pulmonary atresia þ VSD surviving unrepaired to
adulthood, or with previous palliative procedures, may actually benefit from modern surgical or interventional procedures. [268][,][269] Patients
with good-sized confluent PAs and those with large MAPCAs anatomically suitable for unifocalization, who have not developed severe
PVD due to protecting stenosis, should be considered for surgery.
Many unrepaired patients may, however, not be suitable for further
surgery, mainly because of the complexity of their pulmonary vasculature. It is important to appreciate that while cardiac surgery may
improve clinical status or prognosis (the latter is purely speculative),
it is also a major cause of mortality.

Catheter intervention may include balloon dilation/stenting of collateral vessels to enhance pulmonary blood flow. [270] On the other
hand, patients with severe haemoptysis may require coiling of rup
tured collateral vessels.

Survival depends on the complexity of the pulmonary malformations and the results of surgical repair. Survival in palliated patients is

4.12 Transposition of the great arteries
4.12.1 Introduction and background
TGA is characterized by AV concordance and ventriculo-arterial discordance: the aorta originates from the RV, the PA from the LV.
TGA is called simple in the absence of associated congenital anomalies; TGA is called complex in the presence of associated anomalies:
VSD (�45%), LVOTO (�25%), and CoA (�5%). Long-term outcome of complex TGA is, regardless of the type of surgical repair,
worse than that of simple TGA.
The aetiology of TGA is unknown and the pathogenesis is controversial. Familial occurrence exists but is very rare. There is a 2:1 male
preponderance.
Natural history is extremely poor and survival to adult life without
surgical repair is the exception. Surgical techniques have evolved:
atrial switch transitioned to arterial switch procedure, and complex
TGAs are often operated upon using a Rastelli-type repair.
A schematic overview of surgical techniques and their long-term
complications in TGA is provided in Figure 9.

4.12.2 Atrial switch operation
4.12.2.1 Clinical presentation after atrial switch
Older adults with a simple TGA have a Mustard or Senning atrial
switch procedure. The most common complications are:

 - [Systemic RV dysfunction and failure.]

 - [Secondary progressive TR (systemic AV valve).]

 - [Bradycardia and chronotropic incompetence due to loss of sinus]

rhythm; AV conduction is usually intact.

 - [Supraventricular] tachyarrhythmia, typically cavotricuspid
isthmus-dependent flutter, followed by macro-reentry circuit
related to surgical incisions/scars; AF may occur at older age.
High heart rates are often haemodynamically poorly tolerated
because of the inability to increase preload, a consequence of the
(restrictive) atrial baffles. Bradycardia due to SND can promote

AT.

 - [Ventricular tachyarrhythmias: primary polymorphic VT or VF]

due to poor ventricular function and heart failure-related mechanism, or monomorphic VT due to scar/incision/patch-related
reentry in repaired complex TGA; secondary VT or VF, preceded by supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with rapid conduction and consecutive myocardial ischaemia due to the very low

stroke volume associated with the SVT.

 - [Baffle stenosis, either superior baffle (most common) or inferior]

baffle obstruction.

 - [Baffle leakage, with either L][�][R shunt giving rise to pulmonary]

overflow or R�L shunting in the presence of distal flow obstruction, with cyanosis or paradoxical embolism.

 - [Pulmonary veins/venous atrial obstruction, most often at the site]

where the pulmonary veins connect to the pulmonary venous

atrium/RA.


4.11.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment
For follow-up and intervention in patients with Fallot-like repair with
transannular patch, see section 4.10; for patients with repair using a

valved RV�PA conduit, see section 4.14.

Patients with pulmonary atresia þ VSD surviving unrepaired to
adulthood, or with previous palliative procedures, may actually benefit from modern surgical or interventional procedures. [268][,][269] Patients
with good-sized confluent PAs and those with large MAPCAs anatomically suitable for unifocalization, who have not developed severe

tured collateral vessels.

Survival depends on the complexity of the pulmonary malformations and the results of surgical repair. Survival in palliated patients is
significantly lower and has been reported as 60% at 20-year followup. Heart-lung transplantation could possibly be an option for highly

selected individuals.

Patients with pulmonary atresia þ VSD should have periodic followup in a specialized ACHD centre (at least once a year). For the management of cyanosis-related multiorgan involvement, see section

Patients with segmental PAH may be considered for targeted PAH
therapy; see section 3.4.3. [271][,][272]

Symptoms such as dyspnoea, increasing cyanosis, change in the

- [LVOTO can develop due to bulging of the interventricular sep-]

- [PH can become manifest, sometimes decades after the atrial]

present too.

- [Death due to heart failure or sudden death, probably caused by]

arrhythmia.

In larger series with follow-up of up to 40 years, survival is
�75%. [274][,][275] Event-free survival is as low as 20%. [276][,][277] Exercise

capacity is usually reduced by inadequate increase in cardiac output:
chronotropic incompetence, reduced preload resulting from the relatively narrowed and/or non-compliant baffles � inherent to the
atrial switch operation � and diminished RV function.

4.12.2.2 Diagnostic work-up
section 3.3 for general principles.
Clinical evaluation must include looking for signs of venous congestion. A swollen head and neck are a sign of superior baffle obstruction. Oedema of the legs, varices, hepatomegaly, and liver cirrhosis
are seen in inferior baffle obstruction. Stenosis, even complete
obstruction, can be asymptomatic due to an effective bypass circulation provided by the azygos or hemiazygos vein.
An ejection-type systolic murmur suggests subpulmonary
outflow tract obstruction, and a systolic regurgitant-type murmur
suggests regurgitation of the systemic TV. ECG findings include RVH
and, not uncommonly, narrow QRS escape rhythm, without visible P

waves.

- [Echocardiography is the first-line diagnostic modality, providing]

information on size and systolic function of the subpulmonic and
systemic ventricles, subpulmonary outflow tract obstruction, TR,
leakage or obstruction of the atrial baffles, and assessment of pulmonary venous return. Signs of PH are often subtle � decreased
flattening of the interventricular septum in systole and an abnormally wide PA � and can be difficult to recognize. Suspicion of
PH dictates diagnostic heart catheterization to exclude/confirm
PH as it may impact management. Contrast echocardiography
can demonstrate baffle leakage � present in up to 50% in nonselected and asymptomatic patients � or baffle obstruction. [278]

Injection of contrast into the upper limbs frequently misses a leak
in the inferior systemic venous baffle; this can only be excluded
by injection into one of the femoral veins. TOE is useful for evalu

assessment of systemic RV systolic function than echocardiography, and of patency of the atrial baffles. Size of the great arteries
can be measured reliably; an abnormally wide PA and/or large

ment) is essential before PM/ICD implantation or placing new/


additional pacemaker wires through the superior baffle. An alternative to CMR and CCT for assessment of the superior baffle is
contrast injection in the right arm and fluoroscopy.

 - [CPET is important in longitudinal follow-up for serial assessment]

of exercise capacity and chronotropic incompetence. It also can
‘unmask’ baffle leakage (desaturation) that is asymptomatic at

rest.

 - [Holter monitoring, event recorder, and EP testing are indicated]

for selected patients if bradycardia and/or tachyarrhythmias are
suspected.

 - [Cardiac catheterization is indicated when non-invasive assess-]

ment is inconclusive or when suspicion of PH requires evaluation
(see section 3.3.5).

4.12.2.3 Medical treatment

 - [Systemic RV systolic dysfunction: there are no data to support]

the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, or
aldosterone antagonists � alone or in combination � improve
outcome. [280] No solid recommendation can currently be made.

 - [Systemic RV failure: in the case of overt heart failure, diuretics]

relieve symptoms. Although no benefit has been demonstrated
for conventional heart failure medical therapy in patients with
systemic RVs, more symptomatic patients may benefit from prescription of ‘classical’ heart failure medication.

 - [Arrhythmia: drugs that lower heart rate should be used with cau-]

tion, since after atrial switch, patients are prone to bradycardia

and SND.

 - [PH: the exact mechanism of PH must be elucidated before con-]

sideration of medical treatment. Post-capillary PH late after atrial
switch operation seems to be most common, with the consequence that specific pulmonary vasodilator therapy is contraindicated but pre-capillary PH may be present, too. Thus, careful
haemodynamic evaluation is crucial.

4.12.2.4 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment
Electrophysiology testing, ablation, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators.
General principles, also valid for patients with the atrial switch procedure, are discussed in section 3.4.2. [32][,][37]

 - [EP studies and interventions are complicated because baffles]

interfere with normal access to the atria. The dominant mecha
nism of supraventricular arrhythmias is cavotricuspid isthmus
atrial flutter, often requiring baffle puncture to achieve isthmus
block. Alternatively, remote magnetic navigation can be used for
retrograde access to the pulmonary venous atrium.
Conventional retrograde transaortic route access in adults is usually not successful to achieve isthmus block. TOE guidance is recommended when puncture of a baffle is indicated. Programmed

electrical stimulation for risk stratification is not useful.


Indications for intervention are summarized in the

Recommendations for surgical and catheter intervention in TGA after atrial
switch operation table.

ESC Guidelines 619


Recommendations for intervention in transposition of
the great arteries after atrial switch operation





- [Neo-aortic root dilatation, resulting in AR.]

- [Supravalvular PS and pulmonary branch stenosis (unilaterally or]

bilaterally), a consequence of the position of the pulmonary bifurcation anterior to the ascending aorta in the Lecompte technique

and the dilatation of the neo-aortic root.

- [LV dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias are rare but may]

occur; both may be related to problems with the coronary
arteries, [281] which were reimplanted in the neo-aorta.

- [Acute angle of the aortic arch, which may lead to functional]

obstruction and hypertension.


Survival up to 30 years is excellent (>90% of hospital survivors [282] )
and event-free survival is fair (60�80% [283][�][285] ). A large majority of
these patients are asymptomatic. As a rule, exercise capacity is mildly
reduced, but it can be normal. The incidence of late coronary arteryrelated problems is reported to be very low, [286][,][287] which makes it
questionable whether routine screening of coronary arteries is justified.

4.12.3 Arterial switch operation
4.12.3.1 Clinical presentation after arterial switch
Young adults with a simple TGA will probably have had an arterial
switch operation. The most common complications are:

  - [Neo-aortic root dilatation, resulting in AR.]

  - [Supravalvular PS and pulmonary branch stenosis (unilaterally or]

bilaterally), a consequence of the position of the pulmonary bifurcation anterior to the ascending aorta in the Lecompte technique

and the dilatation of the neo-aortic root.

  - [LV dysfunction and ventricular arrhythmias are rare but may]

occur; both may be related to problems with the coronary
arteries, [281] which were reimplanted in the neo-aorta.

  - [Acute angle of the aortic arch, which may lead to functional]

obstruction and hypertension.

Survival up to 30 years is excellent (>90% of hospital survivors [282] )
and event-free survival is fair (60�80% [283][�][285] ). A large majority of
these patients are asymptomatic. As a rule, exercise capacity is mildly
reduced, but it can be normal. The incidence of late coronary arteryrelated problems is reported to be very low, [286][,][287] which makes it
questionable whether routine screening of coronary arteries is justified.

See section 3.3 for general principles. Clinical findings of AR or PS may be

present.

regurgitation; dimension of the neo-aortic root and proximal
ascending aorta; and the acute angulation of the aortic arch. RV
systolic function can be assessed and, if possible, peak RV systolic
pressure (RVSP) should be measured (TR velocity). Due to its
position: far anteriorly and just behind the sternum, echocardiographic visualization of the bifurcation and both branches is rarely
possible.

Rastelli-type operation
4.12.4.1 Clinical presentation after Rastelli-type repair
Adults with TGA, VSD, and PS (complex transposition) have often
had a Rastelli-type repair. The VSD patch directs blood from the LV

to the aorta and the RV is connected to the PA with a valved conduit.

Variants of the Rastelli technique, sharing the same principle, are the
�a l’etage ventriculaire and Nikaidoh techniques.
Common complications are:

[Stenosis or regurgitation of the valved conduit between the RV]

and the PA.

[LVOTO, i.e. obstruction of the flow from the LV to the aorta.]

[Residual VSD.]

[AR.]

[LV dysfunction.]

[Arrhythmias, both ventricular and supraventricular.]

[Endocarditis of the valved conduit.]

by closure of a residual VSD. [288] Endocarditis of the valved conduit is
relatively common.

Exercise capacity is mildly to substantially diminished. Repeat reintervention, surgical or percutaneous, is the fate of most patients with
a Rastelli-type repair.

mitral regurgitation, or AR.

 - [Echocardiography: the connection between the posteriorly posi-]

tioned LV and the anteriorly positioned (due to the TGA) aortic

valve, aortic valve function, and aortic root diameters should be

assessed. The anatomy and function of the conduit between the
RV and the pulmonary trunk must be visualized and assessed
with Doppler interrogation. RV pressure assessed with Doppler
measurement of TR jet velocity is of particular importance
because the Doppler technique often overestimates the pressure
gradient across the RV�PA conduit.

assessment of conduit stenosis. Angiography can be helpful for
assessing the level of stenosis and peripheral PA stenosis.

For indications for treatment of conduit stenosis, see section 4.14.

If L�R shunting through a residual VSD causes symptoms or substantial LV volume overload, surgical/catheter treatment should be
performed (IC recommendation).

4.12.5 Follow-up recommendations (irrespective of
type of repair)
All patients with TGA, regardless of the type of operation, should be
seen at least annually in a specialized ACHD centre, with attention
given to the specific issues previously described (see sections 4.12.2.1,

transposition of the great arteries
4.13.1 Introduction and background

ccTGA, or discordant atrio-ventricular and ventriculo-arterial con
nections, is uncommon. The ventricles are inverted, with the aorta

arising anteriorly from the RV (usually on the left side) and the PA
arising posteriorly from the LV (usually on the right side). The abnormal connections in ‘double’ discordance may be present in hearts

with usual or mirror-image atrial arrangement. Abnormal base-apex
orientation, especially dextrocardia (apex of the heart pointed to the

�
right), is common (20%). Associated lesions are common (80 90%):
VSD (70%), PS (40%), dysplastic systemic TV (e.g. Ebstein-like
malformation).
The position of the AV node (sometimes multiple AV nodes), and

the course of the bundle of His, are often abnormal and lead to AV

conduction abnormalities. The anterior and lateral displacement of a
fragile His bundle is important to recognize during EP studies and

catheter interventions.

4.13.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
The natural history and clinical presentation are determined by associated malformations. Patients with associated lesions reaching adulthood have either been operated upon [closure of VSD, relief of PS
or (rarely) TV repair or replacement] or have a balanced physiology.
Patients with isolated ccTGA rarely develop complications before

adulthood.

Late complications are:

 - [Systemic RV dysfunction and failure.]

 - [Progressive TR (systemic AV valve).]

 - [LVOTO.]

 - [Complete AV block (2% loss of AV conduction per year); it is]

more common after VSD repair and/or TV replacement and may
occur during pregnancy.

 - [VTs (extremely rare).]

Life expectancy is reduced: �50% of patients with associated
lesions were alive at the age of 40 years; without associated lesions,
�50% of patients were alive at the age of 60 years. Patients die from
congestive heart failure or die suddenly, presumably due to VT/VF,
regardless of the presence of advanced heart failure.




 - [Cardiac] catheterization is indicated when non-invasive

assessment is inconclusive, or PH requires evaluation (see section
3.4.5).

4.13.4 Medical treatment

There are no data to support the hypothesis that ACE
inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers or aldosterone antagonists, alone or
in combination, improve outcome. [280] Routine prescription of these
medications to prevent heart failure/improve outcome is not

recommended.

 - [Diuretics may provide relief of symptoms if overt heart failure is]

present. Although there is no proven benefit from heart failure
medical therapy, in terms of outcome in patients with systemic
RVs, ‘classical’ heart failure medications or ARBs may provide
some benefit in more symptomatic patients. [289] A systemic RV
morphology is not a contraindication for a ventricular assist
device. The coarse trabecularization of the RV apex may deserve
special consideration, since it may block the inflow cannula.
Selective myomectomy should be considered.

4.13.5 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment
Catheter intervention may be recommended for PA stenosis or con
duit stenosis, which can be dilated or stented. However, a residual

LVOTO may have a beneficial effect on the dilated subaortic RV and
subaortic AV (tricuspid) valve regurgitation because of the septal
shift. If complete heart block occurs, AV sequential pacing is the
standard. Fixation of the pacemaker wire in the smooth-walled LV is
difficult and requires a screw-in electrode. There are some data suggesting that biventricular pacing with a second ventricular wire
through the (normally connecting) coronary sinus behind the subaortic RV may lead to a better preservation of RV systolic function
than LV pacing alone. [290]

622 ESC Guidelines


The most challenging questions are TR, RV dysfunction, and when
to implant a TV and/or an ICD. In contrast to the situation in the
paediatric age group, in which double switch is an established treatment option in case of systemic RV failure, this approach is very rarely

successful in adults.

Systemic AV valve (tricuspid) regurgitation is frequently the focus
of surgical treatment. Repair is rarely feasible and, as a rule, valve
replacement is the treatment of choice. Pre-operative systemic RVEF
<_40%, PAP >50 mmHg, AF, and New York Heart Association
(NYHA) class III to IV are associated with late mortality. [291]

4.13.6 Follow-up recommendations
Patients with ccTGA need lifelong follow-up in a specialized ACHD
centre at annual intervals, particularly because of conduction disturbances and subaortic ventricular and subaortic AV valve dysfunction.
For arrhythmias, see section 3.4.2.

coronary anatomy (anomalies/abnormal course).

4.14.3 Surgical/catheter interventional treatment
Balloon dilation/stent implantation have been reported to be safe and
to prolong the lifespan of failing conduits. [294][,][295] Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation has now become the treatment of choice for
dysfunctional valves, if technically feasible. Current exclusions for
TPVI include occluded systemic veins, active infection, unsuitable outflow tract morphology, and unfavourable coronary anatomy (compression by the expanded implant). Surgery is preferred when
additional interventions are considered (tricuspid annuloplasty).
Longitudinal data are more important for timing of reintervention
than single measurements.

4.14 Right ventricular to pulmonary
artery conduit
4.14.1 Introduction and background
Conduits establish the continuity between the RV and the PA in complex defects when the native outflow tract is not amenable to reconstruction, including pulmonary atresia, common arterial trunk, TOF,
absent pulmonary valve syndrome, Rastelli procedure, and Ross

operation.
Types of conduits include valved [pulmonary or aortic homograft,
bioprosthetic valves, bovine jugular vein conduits (Contegra)] and
non-valved conduits. There is no ideal conduit. Limited durability
implicates early reoperation. Predictors for conduit failure are sterilization/preservation process, smaller conduit, conduit type, younger
age at implantation, PA stenosis, and diagnosis of transposition. [269][,][292][,][293] Freedom from reoperation for conduit failure at 20
years was reported at 32% and 40%. [269][,][292]

Complications include outgrowth, progressive obstruction with
and without regurgitation, endocarditis, and aneurysms or
pseudoaneurysms.
Clinical presentation may include exertional dyspnoea, palpitations, syncope, and SCD.

4.14.2 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Clinical findings may include a precordial thrill, prominent A wave
of the jugular veins, and systolic murmur. Conduit calcification may
be seen on chest X-ray.

patients with mild obstruction. High-risk patients with high RV
pressure must limit themselves to low-intensity activity/sports
and avoid isometric exercise. Other patients should limit themselves according to symptoms.

4.15 Univentricular heart

This section deals with unoperated and palliated univentricular heart
(UVH). For patients after Fontan operation see section 4.16.

4.15.1 Introduction and background
The term ‘UVH’ summarizes a variety of malformations where either
the RV or LV is missing or, if present, is hypoplastic and thus not amenable for biventricular repair, such as:

 - [Tricuspid atresia.]

 - [Hypoplastic right heart syndrome variants, e.g. pulmonary atresia]

with intact ventricular septum variants.

 - [Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) variants, including mitral]

atresia.

 - [Double-inlet LV.]

 - [Double-inlet RV.]

 - [Extreme forms of unbalanced complete AV septal defects.]

 - [Single ventricle with undefined morphology.]

These malformations are always associated with additional intra
and/or extracardiac lesions such as:

 - [ASD, VSD, AVSD, PDA.]

 - [AS (valvular, subvalvular).]

 - [Aortic arch anomalies: hypoplasia, interruption, coarctation.]

 - [PS (valvular, subvalvular), pulmonary atresia.]

 - [PA anomalies: peripheral stenosis, hypoplasia, one-sided absence.]

 - [Discordant connections, malposition of the great arteries.]

 - [AV valve stenosis, regurgitation, overriding, straddling.]

 - [LA or RA isomerism, abnormal systemic or pulmonary venous]

connections.

 - [Left SVC, absent innominate vein, absent right SVC, absent infra-]

hepatic IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuity.

 - [Aortic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries.]

 - [Polysplenia or asplenia.]

Detailed anatomic description is beyond the scope of these guidelines and can be found in textbooks. Owing to the lack of data, recommendations are mainly based on expert consensus. [296][�][300] When
presenting as adults, the vast majority of patients with these conditions will have undergone previous palliation with some type of



preferably a Fontan operation or one of its modifications; the latter is

covered in section 4.16.

Two different haemodynamic situations can be identified:

 - [No anatomic restriction to pulmonary blood flow: if pulmonary]

circulation remains unmodified (i.e. no surgery), many patients

will die in childhood due to intractable heart failure. Those who

survive this period will have developed severe PVD. This will be a
main determinant of long-term outcome. Many will have had pulmonary banding to restrict pulmonary blood flow in early childhood. An effective banding will protect against PVD, while
allowing enough pulmonary blood flow to limit the degree of cyanosis. A banding that is too loose will result in pulmonary overflow and PVD despite the banding. If the banding is too tight,
pulmonary blood flow will be extremely limited, resulting in

severe cyanosis.

 - [Obstruction to pulmonary blood flow (frequently valvular and/or]

subvalvular PS or atresia): sometimes the obstruction is such that
the pulmonary circulation is adequate (not excessive, thus avoiding development of PH, and not too restricted, thus without
extreme cyanosis). These balanced situations are the exception
but allow survival into adulthood without having surgery. Most
patients have a very restricted pulmonary blood flow, necessitating a systemic-to-PA shunt operation in childhood � most com
�
monly Blalock Taussig (subclavian to PA), rarely Waterston or
Potts (ascending or descending aorta to PA, respectively). If a
systemic-to-PA shunt is too large, pulmonary overflow will result
in PVD at adult age. If the shunt is too small, patients will be
extremely cyanotic. Beyond infancy, an anastomosis between the
SVC and PA is a possibility: the classical Glenn anastomosis to the
right PA (historical) or an end-to-side anastomosis with the PA,
creating a bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis. An
adequate shunt will lead to a balanced situation.

4.15.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
Depending on the extent of pulmonary blood flow, presence or
absence of PVD, and ventricular function, patients may present with
various degrees of cyanosis and congestive heart failure. Exercise ability is generally substantially reduced (with exceptions); complete AV
block, arrhythmias (supraventricular, but also ventricular, SCD not
unusual), stroke, brain abscess, and thromboembolism can occur.
Endocarditis is relatively common in this population. For more

details, see section 3.4.8.

Cyanosis is typically present in patients with UVH without a
Fontan operation. Arterial oxygen saturation commonly ranges from
75�85% but may, in exceptional cases with ideally balanced circula
tions, reach values >90%.

Patients may present with progressive obstruction towards the
aorta. This will lead to ventricular hypertrophy and, eventually, to
reduced cardiac output. Progressive obstruction towards the PA will
cause progressive cyanosis. In Glenn patients, worsening cyanosis
may also be due to development of pulmonary arteriovenous malfor
mations or IVC-to-SVC collaterals.

The UVH has to accommodate both systemic and pulmonary
venous return. This chronic volume overload will lead to a high likelihood of ventricular failure relatively early in life. AV valve regurgitation may develop or progress, if present previously. The already

patients with mild obstruction. High-risk patients with high RV
pressure must limit themselves to low-intensity activity/sports
and avoid isometric exercise. Other patients should limit themselves according to symptoms.

- [Pregnancy: maternal and foetal risks are driven by the underlying]

congenital heart defect and severity of RVOTO, arrhythmia, and
heart failure (see section 3.5.7).

- [IE prophylaxis: recommended in all patients (see][ section 3.4.6][).]


4.15 Univentricular heart

This section deals with unoperated and palliated univentricular heart
(UVH). For patients after Fontan operation see section 4.16.


4.15.1 Introduction and background
The term ‘UVH’ summarizes a variety of malformations where either
the RV or LV is missing or, if present, is hypoplastic and thus not amenable for biventricular repair, such as:



- [Tricuspid atresia.]

- [Hypoplastic right heart syndrome variants, e.g. pulmonary atresia]

with intact ventricular septum variants.

- [Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) variants, including mitral]

atresia.

- [Double-inlet LV.]

- [Double-inlet RV.]

- [Extreme forms of unbalanced complete AV septal defects.]

- [Single ventricle with undefined morphology.]


These malformations are always associated with additional intra
and/or extracardiac lesions such as:



- [ASD, VSD, AVSD, PDA.]

- [AS (valvular, subvalvular).]

- [Aortic arch anomalies: hypoplasia, interruption, coarctation.]

- [PS (valvular, subvalvular), pulmonary atresia.]

- [PA anomalies: peripheral stenosis, hypoplasia, one-sided absence.]

- [Discordant connections, malposition of the great arteries.]

- [AV valve stenosis, regurgitation, overriding, straddling.]

- [LA or RA isomerism, abnormal systemic or pulmonary venous]

connections.

- [Left SVC, absent innominate vein, absent right SVC, absent infra-]

hepatic IVC with azygos or hemiazygos continuity.

- [Aortic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries.]

- [Polysplenia or asplenia.]


Detailed anatomic description is beyond the scope of these guidelines and can be found in textbooks. Owing to the lack of data, recommendations are mainly based on expert consensus. [296][�][300] When
presenting as adults, the vast majority of patients with these conditions will have undergone previous palliation with some type of
systemic-to-PA shunt, cavopulmonary connection (Glenn), or now

diminished exercise capacity will deteriorate further. Eventually,
overt heart failure may develop, in addition to the cyanosis.
In rare cases, with a well-balanced haemodynamic situation, ventricular dysfunction does not develop, and survival until the fifth, sixth,
and even seventh decade has been reported.

4.15.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Clinical findings include central cyanosis, clubbing of fingers
and toes, and often an asymmetric chest with a precordial heave

at the side where the heart lies in the chest. Scoliosis is a common

problem. The second heart sound is typically single, but the rest of
the auscultation depends on the associated abnormalities. ECG may
reveal rhythm or conduction disturbances. Atrial reentrant tachycardia with 2:1 block and only modest tachycardia may be easily

overlooked.

 - [TTE is the key diagnostic technique, providing information on]

anatomy and monitoring of cardiac function during follow-up. The
segmental approach is required in the echocardiographic examination; UVHs are always complex and can present with a wide
range of abnormalities in situs, orientation, and connections.
Fundamental TTE parameters/issues/items in the diagnosis of

UVHs are:

    - Abdominal and atrial situs.

    Position of the heart in the chest and position of the apex.

    Veno-atrial, AV, and ventriculo-arterial connections.

    Morphological and haemodynamic information has to be

obtained on the entire heart.

    Exact anatomy of the ventriculo-arterial connection and its
functional status has to be assessed, with special focus on
obstruction towards the aorta or pulmonary vascular bed.

    AV valve function should be evaluated, with special focus on

regurgitation.

    Ventricular function/hypertrophy.

    ASD/VSD type, size, number, location.

    Ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta; detect/

exclude coarctation.

    - PAs � common trunk, branches, and sources of pulmonary
blood supply.

    - �
Visualization of shunts (Blalock Taussig, Waterston, etc.).
TOE may be indicated in cases of inadequate TTE images.

 - [CMR is the imaging modality of choice for extracardiac anatomy,]

including veno-atrial and ventriculo-arterial connections (CCT is
an alternative). Detailed morphological information of intracardiac anatomy can also be obtained. CMR is also the method of
choice for quantification of ventricular volumes, EF, and relative
distribution of blood flow in the left and right lungs.

 - [Cardiac catheterization is required when intervention is consid-]

ered for haemodynamic assessment, in particular PAP and transpulmonary gradient (PVR is often difficult to assess in this
setting). It is mandatory when patients are evaluated for a Fontan
operation. Evaluation of systemic-to-PA or Glenn shunts � and
their sequelae (stenosis of the pulmonary branches) and other
vascular anomalies (arteriovenous collateral vessels, fistulas, etc.)

�
may also require catheterization.

b Level of evidence.

Interventional treatment, such as pulmonary valvotomy to
increase pulmonary blood flow in cases of severe PS, is debatable.
If the clinical situation is stable, the (frequently high) risk of any
type of surgical intervention should be weighed very carefully against
the possible benefit.
A Fontan operation can only be considered in very well
selected patients (see section 4.16). For patients with severe cyanosis, with decreased pulmonary blood flow without elevated
PVR, a bidirectional Glenn shunt (SVC-to-PA) can be an option.
If a systemic-to-pulmonary shunt (e.g. arteriovenous axillary
fistula or systemic artery pulmonary shunt) is the only option
(bidirectional Glenn shunt not sufficient or PAP not low enough
for this shunt), the benefit of increased pulmonary blood flow
should be weighed against increased volume load to the systemic

ventricle.

For transplantation, previous sternotomies/thoracotomies,
aorto-pulmonary collaterals, and the multisystem nature of cyanotic CHD are technical and medical challenges and limit the

outcome.

4.15.4 Conservative management
See sections 3.4.3 and 3.4.8 for haematological management and the
role of targeted therapy in PVD.

4.15.5 Follow-up recommendations
Regular evaluation is required in a specialized ACHD centre.
Frequency is individualized, but at least yearly, with physical examination, measurement of oxygen saturation, laboratory tests (haematological indices, iron status, liver function, kidney function, etc.),
ECG, X-ray, and echocardiography (see also section 3.4.8).
CMR and an exercise test are required at least once at adult age
and at further intervals timed according to baseline findings.

4.15.6 Additional considerations

 - [Exercise/sports: as a rule, patients do not have an elevated risk of]

death during exercise, but they do have a substantially reduced
exercise capacity. Recreational sports can be considered at a
symptom-limited level.

 - [Pregnancy: contraindicated in patients with severely reduced pul-]

monary blood flow or with severe PVD, or if ventricular function
is poor. Cyanosis poses a significant risk to the foetus, with a live
birth unlikely (<12%) if oxygen saturation is <85% [106] (see section
3.5.7).

 - [For contraception, a combined oral contraceptive pill must be]

avoided because of the risk of thrombogenicity and thromboembolism. Progestogen-only pills and progestogen-eluting
intrauterine devices or implantation systems provide safe contraception with a smaller cardiovascular risk.

 - [IE prophylaxis: indicated in all patients (see][ section 3.4.6][).]

4.16 Patients after Fontan operation
4.16.1 Introduction and background
The Fontan operation was introduced in 1968 and has become the
definitive treatment for suitable patients with a range of cardiac malformations characterized by a single functional ventricle (see section
4.15). Surgery consists of the separation of the systemic and pulmonary venous returns without a subpulmonary ventricle and restores
them to being ‘in series’. Since its introduction, a number of modifications have been made to the original procedure, designed to streamline the systemic venous return to the PAs. Currently, the total
cavopulmonary connection has replaced the atriopulmonary connection (RA appendage to PA), with either an intracardiac or extracardiac conduit between the IVC and the PA, together with an SVC-toPA anastomosis (bidirectional Glenn). [301] This circulation is frequently
established in two stages. Adults with HLHS remain a small but
expanding group of patients. The first data in adulthood describe a
considerable prevalence of major adverse cardiovascular events and
it appears that HLHS patients are more prone to complications than
general Fontan patients, warranting closer follow-up and
assessment. [302]

The natural history and outcome of other palliations for hearts



undertaken in all patients in whom the haemodynamics are suitable.
It is now appreciated that the operative mortality and subsequent
outcome depend on the suitability of the circulation and adherence
to defined criteria. Strict selection gives the best early and late results,
with operative mortality of <5% in modern series and includes low
PVR and PAP (mean <15 mmHg), preserved ventricular function,
adequate PA size, no relevant AV valve regurgitation, and normal
rhythm. A ‘fenestration’ has been performed in selected or all cases
by some centres to allow for shunting of deoxygenated blood to the
systemic circulation at atrial level, aiming to improve the cardiac output at the expense of cyanosis. [303] Fontan operation, when considered late in adults, is not always the palliation of choice because of
the limited long-term outcome.

4.16.2 Clinical presentation and natural history
The lack of a subpulmonary ventricle results in chronic systemic
venous hypertension, markedly altered pulmonary haemodynamics,
and a chronically ‘preload-deprived’ ventricle. A number of important
problems have emerged during long-term follow-up. Although 10year survival may approach 90%, it should be appreciated that a premature decline in cardiovascular performance, with reduced survival,
is inevitable even in the best Fontan patients. [304] Important haemodynamic issues contributing to late Fontan failure include a progressive
decline in systemic ventricular function, AV valve regurgitation, a rise
in PVR, atrial enlargement, pulmonary venous obstruction, progressively restrictive subaortic VSD, and the consequences of chronic
systemic venous hypertension including hepatic congestion and dysfunction. [305] Further complications include atrial and PA thrombus
formation, development of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations,
systemic arterial-to-pulmonary venous or systemic arterial-topulmonary arterial connection, and systemic-to-pulmonary venous

collaterals.

After the Fontan operation, the majority of patients do well during
childhood and adolescence, although exercise capacity is reduced
when measured objectively. However, clinical complications may
subsequently develop, with a progressive decline in exercise performance and heart failure, cyanosis, chronic venous insufficiency,
and development of important arrhythmias, especially in patients
with a classical Fontan operation. [306] By 10 years after a Fontan operation, �20% of patients have supraventricular tachyarrhythmias
(including typically IART and atrial flutter, but also AF and focal
AT). [307] Bradycardia due to SND may facilitate occurrence of AT.
The incidence of AT is lower after total cavopulmonary connection
than atriopulmonary connection, and lower after extracardiac conduit than intracardiac conduit. [308] Atrial tachyarrythmias with rapid

conduction are associated with SCD.

The spectrum of Fontan-associated liver disease is wide and
includes both hepatic congestion and severe fibrosis, with signs of
portal hypertension and hyperenhancing nodules as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. [309]

Protein-losing enteropathy is a rare but important complication
and results in peripheral oedema, pleural effusions, and ascites. It can
be diagnosed by documentation of low serum albumin and elevated

recent study reported a 5-year survival of 88%; however, treatment
remains challenging. [311] Plastic bronchitis and lymphatic system dysfunction may further complicate prognosis.

4.16.3 Diagnostic work-up
See section 3.3 for general principles.
Clinical findings include commonly mild, non-pulsatile jugular
venous distension. Significant jugular venous distension and hepatomegaly, however, raise suspicion of Fontan obstruction or ventricular
failure. ECG frequently shows junctional rhythm or atrial arrhythmias.
Pleural effusion on chest X-ray raises suspicion of protein-losing
enteropathy.

and pulmonary veins (e.g. right pulmonary vein obstruction by

false positive diagnosis of thrombus. CMR is regularly performed
for ventricular volumes, Fontan pathway patency and flows, to
evaluate AV valve regurgitation, subaortic obstruction, myocar
dial fibrosis, and for detection of thrombus.

 - [As liver dysfunction, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma]

have been recognized as typical complications in this setting, regular liver imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic
resonance) and laboratory assessment should be performed.

 - [Cardiac catheterization should be performed at a low threshold]

in cases of unexplained oedema, exercise deterioration, newonset arrhythmia, cyanosis, and haemoptysis. It provides information on ventricular and valvular function, haemodynamics including PVR, and Fontan obstruction and anomalous vascular
connections (see section 4.16.2). Integration with CMR for flows
(cardiac output) may allow more precise measurement of PVR.

4.16.4 Medical treatment

 - [Anticoagulation: right atrial blood stasis and disturbed coagula-]

tion may predispose to thrombosis. The potential for subclinical,
recurrent pulmonary embolism (eventually leading to a rise in
PVR) and systemic embolism have led to a recommendation, by
some, for lifelong anticoagulation. There is, however, no evidence
of benefit, and practice varies between centres. Anticoagulation
is indicated in the presence, or with a history, of atrial thrombus,
atrial arrhythmias, or thromboembolic events. Although NOACs



robust prospective efficacy data are lacking and thus these drugs
cannot currently be recommended as standard therapy.

 - [Antiarrhythmic therapy: loss of sinus rhythm may precipitate]

rapid haemodynamic decline and atrial arrhythmias. Sustained
atrial arrhythmia with rapid AV conduction should be considered
a medical emergency. Electrical cardioversion is the mainstay of
treatment, as drug therapy is often ineffective. Amiodarone may
be effective in preventing recurrence, but it has many long-term

side effects. Sotalol can be an alternative. There should be a low

threshold for radiofrequency ablation, although these are difficult
arrhythmias to treat in the catheterization laboratory. [313]

Antitachycardia atrial PMs may assist. If AV pacing is required, this
will need an epicardial approach. Occurrence of arrhythmias
should prompt haemodynamic evaluation. In addition, a proactive
approach of EP evaluation and ablation therapy (where appropriate) should be considered, including Fontan conversion with concomitant arrhythmia surgery. ICD therapy may be considered in
selected patients. See section 3.4.2.

 - [Therapy of protein losing enteropathy: medical therapy remains]

challenging and various treatments have been proposed (after
exclusion of haemodynamic problems) including salt restriction,
high protein diet, diuretics, ACE inhibitors (may be poorly tolerated), steroids, albumin infusion, chronic subcutaneous heparin,
creation of a fenestration (by interventional catheter), and eventually, consideration of transplantation.

 - [Pulmonary vasodilators: ERAs and PDE-5 inhibitors may be con-]

sidered in selected patients with elevated pulmonary pressure/

resistance in the absence of elevated ventricular end diastolic

pressure. Data on the routine use of these medications in Fontan
patients are limited at present. A randomized trial of the ERA
bosentan has demonstrated significantly improved cardiopulmonary exercise capacity in 75 adults with Fontan physiology. [314]

4.16.5 Surgical/interventional treatment
Patients with a ‘failing Fontan’ (with a combination of intractable
arrhythmia, right atrial dilation, worsening AV valve regurgitation,
deterioration of ventricular function, and/or atrial thrombus) should
be considered for surgery. [315] While patients with failing systemic
ventricular function may benefit from heart transplantation (performed in experienced settings), patients with preserved systemic
ventricular function, atrial arrhythmia, and impaired flow dynamics in
the Fontan pathway may benefit from conversion to extracardiac
total cavopulmonary connection and concomitant cryoablation. [316]

The latter has provided good early results in a very experienced setting, but is associated with surgical mortality and ongoing morbidity,
with the need for both continued drug therapy and pacemaker
implantation in the majority of cases. [317] If performed late, conversion
may be less likely to result in a good outcome, and cardiac transplantation may be required. However, the best timing for a conversion
remains a matter of uncertainty. In selected adult patients, it may be
appropriate to consider device closure of a fenestration if there is significant cyanosis, but this may also worsen the patient’s condition.
Catheter intervention may also be required in the case of flow

obstruction, or anomalous vascular connections.

exclude even minor obstructions to cavopulmonary flow and pulmonary venous return, which may have a major haemodynamic impact.

4.16.7 Additional considerations

 - [Exercise/sports: after Fontan operation, patients have significantly]

reduced exercise capacity as part of their circulation. However,
moderate symptom-limited aerobic exercise is to be recommended according to current recommendations to improve
musculatory strength and quality of life. [24]

 - [Pregnancy: patients with a Fontan circulation and any complica-]

tion should be advised against pregnancy. Successful pregnancy is
possible in selected patients, although with significant maternal
morbidity, especially heart failure and arrhythmia, but also thromboembolic complications. Therapeutic anticoagulants should be
considered, balanced against the risk of bleeding, which is also
higher in these patients. Intensive monitoring, including after
delivery, is mandatory. There is a high miscarriage rate of
27�55% and a high rate of prematurity and intrauterine growth
restriction. Whether pregnancy with its volume loading has an
adverse effect on the long-term outcome of women with a single

ventricle remains to be elucidated.

Fontan (<6 months), cyanosis, a prosthetic valve, residual patch
leak, or prior endocarditis.

4.17 Coronary anomalies
4.17.1 Introduction and background
Coronary anomalies include anomalous aortic origin of a coronary
artery (AAOCA), anomalous coronary artery from the PA
(ACAPA), and coronary fistulae.

4.17.1.1 Anomalous coronary artery from the pulmonary artery
Although many congenital coronary anomalies are benign, natural
history studies of anomalous left coronary artery from the PA
(ALCAPA) document poor outcome if untreated. [318] ACAPA results
in low oxygen levels in the coronary artery, coronary steal syndrome,
and myocardial ischaemia. ALCAPA can present as a silent or symptomatic myocardial infarction, LV dysfunction, VTs, or even SCD.
Patients may also primarily present with volume overload due to
L�R shunt causing heart failure symptoms. However, anomalous
right coronary artery from the PA (ARCAPA) has frequently been
diagnosed incidentally. Dual coronary system repair, including coronary button transfer with or without an interposition graft, is preferred. A coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with closure of the
ACAPA should be reserved for those in whom coronary transfer is

not feasible.

4.17.1.2 Anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery
Natural history studies are lacking regarding untreated patients with
AAOCA. The debate about management is ongoing, in particular in
patients with an interarterial course of an anomalous coronary artery.

Risk assessment for SCD is difficult because of the lack of data.

Autopsy series show that most patients are young (<35 years) and
die during, or shortly after, exercise. Myocardial fibrosis has been
demonstrated, suggesting myocardial ischaemia may play a role. Left
coronary artery arising from the opposite (right) sinus is less

4.16.6 Follow-up recommendations
As a result of these many complex issues, the care of Fontan patients
is one of the major challenges for ACHD practitioners. All Fontan
patients should be followed in specialized ACHD centres, usually at
least annually, with echocardiography, ECG, blood tests, and exercise
testing. Intervals for CMR and hepatic ultrasound (or computed
tomography) must be decided on an individual basis. For adults, it
appears reasonable to perform a baseline hepatic assessment with
magnetic resonance imaging at the first visit to guide the frequency
and mode of follow-up based on the degree of pre-existing hepatic
changes. In addition, yearly follow-up hepatic assessments including,
for example, liver ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein measurement,
should be considered after consultation with local hepatology

services.

Comprehensive assessment is mandatory for patients with manifestations of the ‘failing Fontan’ complex, with particular care to

common, but more malignant than the right coronary artery from
the left sinus. High orifice, ostial stenosis, slit-like/fish-mouth-shaped
orifice, acute-angle take-off, intramural course and its length, or interarterial course and hypoplasia of the proximal coronary artery have
been associated with myocardial ischaemia and have all been proposed as risk factors. [319][�][322]

Risk stratification must also include age (<35 years) and level of
exercise (e.g. competitive sports). There is very limited evidence that
surgery in asymptomatic middle-aged patients provides any survival
benefit or modifies the SCD risk. [323][,][324]

4.17.1.3 Coronary artery fistulae
A coronary artery fistula, whether congenital or acquired, is an
abnormal connection between a coronary artery and cardiac chamber or vessel. Small fistulae have a good prognosis without treatment.
Medium or large fistulae are associated with long-term complications
(angina, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart failure, and endocarditis). The presence of symptoms, complications, and a significant
shunt are the main indications for percutaneous or surgical closure.

#### 5 Quality indicators

The overall aim of this new edition of the ESC Clinical Practice

Guidelines for ACHD is to assist caregivers in their daily practice for
the benefit of patients. In a next step, it is important to analyse the
adaptation of, and the adherence to, these Guidelines in practice, a
process that can be envisaged using Quality Indicators (QIs).
QIs are sets of measures that enable the quantification of adherence to Guideline recommendations and provide a mechanism for
measuring opportunities to improve cardiovascular care and outcomes. [325] QIs show important differences from Clinical Practice

Guidelines. For instance, the latter are recommendations for care to

apply prospectively to individual patients, whereas QIs are applied
retrospectively to a group of patients to assess if a care process was
delivered or not. [325]

QIs are derived from evidence, feasible, concretely interpretable, and usable. [326] The goal of QIs is to improve quality of health
care, and they have been increasingly used by health authorities,
professional organisations, healthcare payers, as well as the
public. [327][�][329]

The process of development and defining QIs for the management
of specific ACHD items has been initiated during the Guideline writing process and results will be published later in a dedicated

document.

#### 6 Gaps in evidence

6.1 General aspects
6.1.1 Organization of care and patient evaluation

 - [Congenital heart defects are arbitrarily classified into lesions of]

different complexities (mild, moderate, severe; Table 4). The validity of this classification for clinical management and risk stratification remains to be investigated in large registries.

 - [Minimal volumes of patients under care at each ACHD expert]

centre, and the necessary staff resources for an optimal outcome,

need to be defined.

 - [Relevant outcome measures, over and above mortality, need to]

be determined to measure quality of care.

 - [The role of neurohormones to estimate disease severity and tim-]

ing of interventions is not yet fully established and needs to be

defined.

6.1.2 Heart failure

 - [The pathophysiology/mechanism of heart failure, especially in]

those with a systemic RV and Fontan circulation, is incompletely
understood and needs further study to find better ways for pre
vention and treatment.

 - [Indications for application of standard heart failure treatment in]

both acute and chronic settings need to be better defined.

 - [The prediction and course of heart failure needs to be better]

defined to improve indications and timing of ventricular assist
device/transplantation.

 - [Large-scale collaborative international prospective registries on]

medical and device therapy in ACHD are needed and support
for the set up and practical implementation is required.

6.1.3 Arrhythmia

 - [Dedicated scoring systems to assess the indication for anticoagu-]

lation in the setting of atrial arrhythmias are needed for moderate
and complex CHD.

 - [Targeting slow-conducting anatomical isthmuses by catheter]

ablation has been highly effective to control monomorphic VT in
repaired tetralogy of Fallot. Whether catheter mapping can contribute to individualized risk stratification in patients without
spontaneous VTs in repaired tetralogy of Fallot and related
defects requires further research.

 - [The potential loss of accessibility to slow-conducting anatomical]

isthmuses by catheter ablation after re-valving rTOF and related
defects is of concern. Whether patients without documented VT
benefit from preventive ablation before or during re-valving

should be studied.

 - [Indications for pacing and CRT in ACHD patients are mainly]

derived from adults with anatomically normal hearts with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy and are not adapted to the diversity of structural and functional CHD substrates. The selection of
CRT candidates, CRT application, and optimal pacing sites for
the different CHD substrates requires further research.

6.1.4 Pulmonary arterial hypertension

 - [The impact of medical PAH therapy on survival of patients with]




 - [The role of upfront combination therapy in PAH-CHD requires]

further attention.

 - [Limited experience is available for prostacyclin therapy in]

patients with PAH-CHD and needs further investigation.

6.1.5 Cyanotic patients

 - [The benefit of routine anticoagulation, in the absence of any]

strong risk factor for thromboembolic complications (e.g. atrial
arrhythmias), is controversial and requires further study.

6.2 Specific lesions

6.2.1 Shunt lesions

 - [Late outcome after device closure requires further study, partic-]

ularly of arrhythmias.

 - [The impact of shunt closure on long-term outcome of patients]

with PAH remains an area of uncertainty; further research is
required to better define the thresholds for treatment

recommendations.

6.2.2 Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and

coarctation

 - [The optimal timing of intervention in asymptomatic severe]

LVOTO requires further study.

 - [Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is rapidly evolving; its]

role in ACHD needs further refinement.

 - [According to the 2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of]
arterial hypertension, [190] definitions of hypertension in patients
with repaired CoA are the same as in general arterial hypertension and patients should be managed according to the general
guidelines: evidence for this strategy is lacking and prospective
studies are required.

6.2.3 Aortopathies

 - [Estimation of the risk for aortic dissection and definition of the]

threshold for prophylactic surgery in HTAD based on diameter
alone is suboptimal and calls for a more personalized approach.
Whether the type of underlying gene defect is helpful in this
stratification requires further study.

 - [Current] prophylactic treatment regimens in HTAD
patients include beta blockers and ARBs. Either in monotherapy or
combined, neither one prevents further growth of the aorta. The
search for new and better treatment targets should continue.

6.2.4 Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction

 - [Criteria for concomitant TV repair at the time of RVOT surgery]

require refinement.

 - [The identification of patients with low-gradient RVOTO who]

have severe stenosis and would benefit from intervention

requires improvement.

 - [The criteria for identification of RVOTO patients who would]

benefit from reintervention for residual PR requires further

research.

 - [The role of an EP study for risk stratification for SCD is contro-]

versial in patients with rTOF and needs further study.

#### 7 Key messages

7.1 General aspects
7.1.1 Organization of care and patient evaluation

 - [Special structural and organizational healthcare requirements are]

necessary to meet the needs of ACHD patients.

 - [Multimodality imaging is key for adequate assessment of overall]

anatomy and ventricular and valvular function, and quantification
of blood flow, including perfusion distribution.

 - [Objective exercise testing is an important tool for determining]

the timing of interventions and reinterventions.

 - [Cardiac catheterization remains key for the assessment of hae-]

modynamics, in particular, PAP and vascular resistance.

7.1.2 Heart failure

 - [The key treatment for heart failure in ACHD patients remains its]

prevention by optimizing haemodynamics and heart rhythm. This
requires systematic follow-up in specialized centres to facilitate
timely intervention.

 - [In a biventricular circulation, standard heart failure treatment can]

be extrapolated to ACHD patients with a systemic LV and may
be applied in patients with a systemic RV, although it remains
uncertain whether the known benefits of treating a failing LV can
be expected. Pathophysiology of patients with an atrial switch,
and especially with a UVH and Fontan palliation, differs markedly
from a ‘regular circulation’ and standard heart failure therapy has
to be applied cautiously.

 - [Timely referral and consultation with ACHD and heart failure]

specialists in a centre with a transplant service and ACHD expertise is recommended, especially in those with moderate and
severe complexity CHD.

7.1.3 Arrhythmia

 - [In all patients, evaluation for a reversible cause of an arrhythmia]

and for new or residual haemodynamic abnormalities should be
performed.

 - [Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the aim in most ACHD patients.]

 - [For optimal chronic arrhythmia management, referral to a centre]

with a multidisciplinary team and expertise in ACHD-related
arrhythmias is mandatory.

 - [Patients with documented arrhythmias or at high risk for post-]

procedural arrhythmias considered for percutaneous or surgical
(re)interventions should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team
with expertise in interventions and invasive treatment of
arrhythmias.

7.1.4 Pulmonary arterial hypertension

 - [PAH in CHD is a progressive disease with poor prognosis.]

 - [High suspicion of PAH, and regular assessment for the presence]

of PAH in patients with shunt lesions, after defect closure is

recommended.

 - [Proactive treatment is required in all PAH patients, including]

those with Eisenmenger syndrome.

 - [Women with CHD and confirmed pre-capillary PH should be]

counselled against pregnancy.



- [The identification of asymptomatic Ebstein patients with severe]

TR who would benefit from TV surgery requires further

improvement.

- [The identification of Ebstein patients at risk for late life-]

threatening arrhythmias needs to be improved.


6.2.6 Tetralogy of Fallot



- [Optimal timing of PVRep for asymptomatic patients with signifi-]

cant PR needs to be further improved.

- [Long-term follow-up studies after TPVI are required to increase]

knowledge about valve durability, consequences of stent frac
tures, and occurrence of endocarditis.

biventricular pacing in patients with a systemic RV after an atrial
switch procedure requires further study.

- [Risk stratification for SCD and indications for primary ICD]

implantation after atrial switch require refinement.

- [After an arterial switch procedure, the risk of dissection/rupture]

of neo-aortic root aneurysms requires further study to refine the
recommendations for prophylactic surgery.

- [Long-term follow-up after arterial switch is required to study the]

risk for development of CAD after reimplantation of the coronary arteries into the neo-aortic root.

Fontan patients is not clear and requires further study.

- [The effects of pregnancy on long-term maternal outcome must]

be better established.

- [Physiological determinants of long-term outcome in Fontan]

patients, including the role of the lymphatic system, requires

more research.


6.2.10 Coronary anomalies



- [Identification] of adult patients with coronary anomalies
(AAOCA, ACAPA) who are at risk for SCD, and for whom surgery provides benefit at adult age, requires further research.

ESC Guidelines 631


7.1.5 Cyanotic patients

 - [Cyanotic patients present with a multisystem disorder and are at]

risk for both bleeding and thrombotic complications, causing a
therapeutic dilemma.

 - [Routine phlebotomies must be avoided as they put patients at]

risk for iron-deficient anaemia and cerebrovascular complications. Therapeutic phlebotomy is only indicated in the presence
of moderate/severe hyperviscosity symptoms.

 - [Cyanotic patients have a very balanced, but fragile, pathophysiol-]

ogy and any intervention puts the patient at high risk; all interventions must therefore be performed in an ACHD expert centre.

 - [Prophylactic measures are the mainstay of care to prevent and]

avoid complications.

7.2 Specific lesions

7.2.1 Shunt lesions

 - [Treatment decisions require careful evaluation of ventricular vol-]

ume overload and pulmonary circulation.

 - [In patients with non-invasive signs of elevated PAP, heart cathe-]

terization with assessment of PVR is mandatory.

 - [In the presence of PVR >_5 WU, ASD closure should be avoided.]

VSD and PDA closure may only be considered in selected
patients with significant shunt after careful evaluation in an
ACHD and PH expert centre.

 - [Device closure is the treatment of choice when technically]

feasible.

7.2.2 Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction

 - [The strongest indications for surgery remain symptoms and LV]

dysfunction.

 - [Exercise testing should be performed in patients with severe]

obstruction who do not report symptoms in order to confirm

asymptomatic status.

 - [In congenital valvular AS, associated aortic disease (ascending]

aortic dilatation and/or CoA) needs to be excluded.

7.2.3 Aortic coarctation

 - [Correct blood pressure measurement (right arm, ambulatory) is]

essential in the follow-up of patients with CoA.

 - [The decision to (re)intervene depends on blood pressure, gra-]

dient, and stenosis morphology.

 - [Stenting is the treatment of choice when technically feasible.]

7.2.4 Aortopathies

 - [Lifelong surveillance is essential in all HTAD patients and should]

include imaging of the entire aorta, as well as assessment of valvular and myocardial function.

 - [The aortic diameter at which surgery should be performed]

depends on the underlying disease and presence of risk factors.

7.2.5 Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction

 - [RVOTO may be overestimated by the flow velocity across the]

obstruction, particularly when the narrowing is elongated, or



Therefore, cross-checking with RV pressure estimated from TR
velocity is required.

 - [Catheter intervention is the treatment of choice for patients with]

non-dysplastic valvular PS (balloon valvuloplasty) and with
peripheral PS (often with stent implantation).

 - [The indication for intervention is more restrictive whenever a]

valve substitute is required because of its long-term implications
for complications and requirement for reintervention.

7.2.6 Ebstein anomaly

 - [Timing of surgery remains challenging and this operation should]

only be performed by surgeons with specific experience in this

lesion.

 - [Valve repair is the preferred technique whenever feasible.]

7.2.7 Tetralogy of Fallot

 - [Significant PR and/or RVOTO, RV and LV dysfunction, and]

arrhythmias are common long-term complications.

 - [Possible risk factors associated with any ventricular arrhythmia]

and SCD in rTOF are QRS duration >180 ms, LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, RV dysfunction, inducible VT at programmed
electrical stimulation, and history of atrial arrhythmia.

 - [The optimal timing for intervention in asymptomatic severe PR]

remains challenging. Normalization of RV size becomes unlikely
when the end diastolic volume index exceeds 160 mL/m [2], but

this cut-off for reintervention may not correlate with clinical

benefit.

 - [TPVI has become the treatment of choice for RVOT reinterven-]

tion when anatomically feasible.

7.2.8 Transposition of the great arteries

 - [Systemic ventricular failure, secondary systemic AV valve regurgi-]

tation, arrhythmia, and baffle stenosis and/or leakage are common long-term complications that need to be addressed after
atrial switch operation.

 - [Outcome of morbidity has markedly improved with introduction]

of the arterial switch operation. Dilatation of the neo-aortic root
with or without significant regurgitation of the neo-aortic valve,
supravalvular PS, and pulmonary branch stenosis mostly occur
during infancy, but may need reintervention during adulthood.

 - [New LV systolic dysfunction and/or arrhythmias after arterial]

switch require full evaluation, including exclusion of ostial/proximal stenoses of the reimplanted coronary arteries.

 - [Failure of the RV-to-PA conduit (stenosis, regurgitation, or both)]

is the predominant long-term complication requiring reintervention after the Rastelli operation.

7.2.9 Congenitally corrected transposition of the great

arteries

 - [Systemic RV failure, systemic AV valve regurgitation, AV block,]

and atrial arrhythmia are common late complications.

 - [Systemic AV valve regurgitation is an important driver of late out-]

come and, when severe, should be addressed before systemic
RV function becomes impaired.



- [Cyanotic patients present with a multisystem disorder and are at]

risk for both bleeding and thrombotic complications, causing a
therapeutic dilemma.

- [Routine phlebotomies must be avoided as they put patients at]

risk for iron-deficient anaemia and cerebrovascular complications. Therapeutic phlebotomy is only indicated in the presence
of moderate/severe hyperviscosity symptoms.

- [Cyanotic patients have a very balanced, but fragile, pathophysiol-]

ogy and any intervention puts the patient at high risk; all interventions must therefore be performed in an ACHD expert centre.

7.2.5 Right ventricular outflow tract obstruction



- [RVOTO may be overestimated by the flow velocity across the]

obstruction, particularly when the narrowing is elongated, or
stenosis is present in series (e.g. subvalvular and valvular).

632 ESC Guidelines



 - [Surveillance for liver problems is mandatory in all Fontan]

patients.

7.2.11 Coronary anomalies

 - [CCT is the preferred technique for the evaluation of high-risk]

anatomy including features such as an intramural course and orifice anomalies (slit-like orifice, acute-angle take-off, orifice >1 cm
above the sinotubular junction).

 - [Assessment of stress-induced ischaemia, by means of advanced]

imaging modalities with physical stress, is the key for decision
making.

 - [In patients with coronary fistulae, the presence of symptoms,]

complications, and a significant shunt are the main indications for
percutaneous or surgical closure.


7.2.10 Univentricular heart and Fontan operation

 - [Although quality of life is well preserved in many Fontan patients,]

all require regular intensive follow-up at an ACHD expert centre
as they are at risk of developing multiple severe complications
including arrhythmia, heart failure, hepatic disease, and proteinlosing enteropathy.

 - [Low pulmonary artery pressure is mandatory for a good func-]

tioning Fontan circulation and a low threshold for invasive haemodynamic assessment is recommended when dysfunction is
suspected, or complications occur.

 - [Arrhythmias are poorly tolerated and require immediate action.]

 - [Pregnancy is feasible in selected patients with well-functioning]

Fontan circulation but there is a high risk of miscarriage and pregnancy should be managed in an ACHD expert centre.
