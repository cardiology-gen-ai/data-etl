### 1. Preamble


Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management
strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines


and their recommendations should facilitate decision making of
health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and

caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of Guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other societies and organizations. Because of their impact on clinical practice,
quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be
found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Wri
ting-ESC-Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.
In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the
ESC carries out the EurObservational Research Programme of international registries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions which
are essential to assess, diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of
resources and adherence to Guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and
around the world, based on high-quality data collected during routine
clinical practice.
Furthermore, the ESC has developed and embedded, in some of
its guidelines, a set of quality indicators (QIs) which are tools to evaluate the level of implementation of the Guidelines and may be used by
the ESC, hospitals, healthcare providers and professionals to measure
clinical practice as well as used in educational programmes, alongside
the key messages from the Guidelines, to improve quality of care and

clinical outcomes.

The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in
order to represent professionals involved with the medical care of
patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a
comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of
a given condition according to ESC Committee for Practice
Guidelines (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the
risk�benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and
graded according to predefined scales, as outlined below.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration
of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as real or
potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of interest
were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest rules and
can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/guidelines).
This process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in the
development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of
interest that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC
and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from
the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of
new Guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the
endorsement process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines
undergo extensive review by the CPG and external experts. After
appropriate revisions the Guidelines are approved by all the

ESC Guidelines 23

experts involved in the Task Force. The finalized document is
approved by the CPG for publication in the European Heart
Journal. The Guidelines were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence
available at the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation
of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions,
summary slides, booklets with essential messages, summary cards
for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital applications
(smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus, for . [.................................]

website and hosted on the EHJ website. The National Cardiac
Societies of the ESC are encouraged to endorse, adopt, translate
and implement all ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes

are needed because it has been shown that the outcome of disease

may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical

recommendations.

Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in
the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic

or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines do
not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of
health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in
consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation
with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or
necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify
the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.

European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2005 [1] and some aspects
were subsequently updated in 2018 and 2019. [2,3] The overarching

aim of these recommendations was to minimize the risk of adverse

events in highly trained athletes. It is important to recognize, however, that most of the exercising population engages in leisure sport

and solo recreational exercise and, unlike elite athletes, these individ
uals have a higher prevalence of risk factors for atherosclerosis and

established CVD.

Regular physical activity (PA), including systematic exercise, is an
important component of therapy for most CVDs and is associated
with reduced cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause mortality. In an era
where there is an increasing trend towards a sedentary lifestyle and a
rising prevalence of obesity and associated CVDs, the promotion of
PA and regular exercise is more crucial than ever and at the forefront
of priorities for all scientific CV societies. Even during routine

### 2. Introduction


Exercise recommendations and eligibility criteria for sports participation in competitive athletes with cardiovascular disease (CVD) were
originally published by the Sports Cardiology Section of the


Figure Central illustration Moderate physical activity should be promoted in all individuals with cardiovascular disease. Appropriate risk stratification and optimal therapy are essential for providing exercise prescription for more vigorous activity. Individuals should be involved in the decision making
process and a record of the discussion and exercise plan should be documented in the medical records.

ESC Guidelines 25


consultations for other considerations, physicians are encouraged to
promote exercise in all patients.
Although proportionately scarce, exercise may paradoxically trigger sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in individuals with CVD, particularly
those who were previously sedentary or have advanced CVD. [4,5] In
parallel with the drive to promote exercise in all individuals, [6] it is
anticipated that physicians will be confronted with an increasing number of enquiries from individuals with established risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) or established CVDs about participation
in exercise programmes and recreational sports activities. Such consultations need to strike a balance between the multiple benefits of
exercise, the small risk of sudden death, and the patient’s goals for
cardiorespiratory fitness and ongoing participation in relatively strenuous exercise following a CV diagnosis.
The current Guidelines for exercise and sports participation in
individuals with CVD are the first of a kind by the ESC. Sports cardiology is a relatively novel and emerging sub-speciality, therefore the
evidence base for the natural history of disease progression or risk of
death during intensive exercise and competitive sport among individuals with CVD is relatively sparse. This is reflected by the fact that a
disproportionately large number of recommendations are reliant on
the wisdom and vast experience of the consensus group rather than
on large prospective studies. We acknowledge the inherent difficulties in formulating recommendations for all scenarios in a heterogeneous population with a diverse spectrum of CVDs in light of the
limited availability of evidence. Therefore, these recommendations
should not be considered as legally binding and should not discourage
individual physicians from practising outside the remit of this document, based on their clinical experience in sports cardiology.
Where possible, the Guidelines have included the most up-to-date
research in exercising individuals with CVD. The current Guidelines
also draw upon existing ESC Guidelines for the investigation, risk
assessment, and management of individuals with CVDs to aid physicians when prescribing exercise programmes or providing advice for
sports participation. We hope that the document will serve as a useful clinical guide but also as an incentive for future research to challenge established wisdom.
In line with good clinical practice, the present document encourages shared decision making with the athlete patient and respects the
autonomy of the individual after provision of detailed information
about the impact of sports and the potential risks of complications
and/or adverse events (Central illustration). Similarly, all exercise prescription and related discussions between the individual and the
physician should be documented in the medical report.

Higher levels of PA and fitness are associated with lower all-cause

known malignancies. [7][�][16] Despite the substantial health benefits provided by regular PA, intense exercise may paradoxically act as a trigger for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) in the presence
of underlying CVD. Indeed, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the leading
cause of sports and exercise-related mortality in athletes. [17][�][19] CV
safety during sports participation for individuals at all levels and ages
is imperative to avoid catastrophic and often preventable SCD and
has become a common goal among medical and sports governing
organizations. [20][�][24]

Pre-participation CV screening aimed at the detection of disorders
associated with SCD is universally supported by major medical societies. [20][�][22,25,26] However, the best method for CV screening of
young competitive athletes (<35 years old) remains controversial,
and limited data are available to guide recommendations in master
athletes (>_35 years old)
Screening strategies must be tailored to the target population and
the specific disorders with highest risk. SCD in young athletes is
caused by a variety of structural and electrical disorders of the heart,
including cardiomyopathies, ion channel disorders, coronary anomalies, and acquired cardiac conditions. [17,27,28] In adult and senior athletes, atherosclerotic CAD is the primary condition leading to major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). [28,29]

3.2 Definitions of recreational and
competitive athletes
The ESC defines an athlete as ‘an individual of young or adult age,
either amateur or professional, who is engaged in regular exercise
training and participates in official sports competition’. [1,30] Similarly,
the American Heart Association (AHA) and others define a competitive athlete as an individual involved in regular (usually intense) training in organized individual or team sports, with an emphasis on
competition and performance. [31,32] Athletes involved in competitive
sports span the age spectrum and can compete at the youth, high
school, academy, university, semi-professional, professional, national,
international, and Olympic levels. As a distinction, a recreational athlete engages in sports for pleasure and leisure-time activity, whereas
a competitive athlete is highly trained with a greater emphasis on performance and winning. In a proposed classification of athletes based
on the minimum volume of exercise, ‘elite’ athletes (i.e. national
team, Olympians, and professional athletes) generally exercise >_10
h/week; ‘competitive’ athletes [i.e. high school, college, and older
(master) club level athletes] exercise >_6 h/week; and ‘recreational’
athletes exercise >_4 h/week. [33] This distinction is somewhat arbitrary
since some recreational athletes, such as long-distance cyclists and
runners, engage in exercise at higher volumes than some professional
athletes participating in skill sports.

3.3 Exercise-related major adverse cardiovascular events

Exercise-related MACE include SCA and SCD; acute coronary syndromes (ACS) such as myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction (MI); transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) and cerebrovascular
accidents (CVA); and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.
SCA is defined as an unexpected collapse due to a cardiac cause in
which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and/or defibrillation is
provided in an individual regardless of the survival outcome. [17,27,32]

### 3. Identification of cardiovascular disease and risk stratification in individuals participating in recreational and competitive sports


3.1 Introduction

Higher levels of PA and fitness are associated with lower all-cause
mortality, lower rates of CVD, and lower prevalence of several

26 ESC Guidelines


SCD is defined as a sudden unexpected death due to a cardiac cause,
or a sudden death in a structurally normal heart at autopsy with no
other explanation for death and a history consistent with cardiacrelated death (i.e. requiring cardiac resuscitation). [17,27,32] In order to
compare previously reported data on SCA and SCD using variable
definitions, the timing of the event should be categorized as occurring
during the episode, within the first hour post-exercise, or between 1
to 24 h post-exercise. [30] The activity at the time of the event can be
further characterized as occurring during training or competition, at
rest, or during sleep. [30]

Exercise-induced ACS are most likely to affect adult and senior
athletes and result from atherosclerotic plaque disruption and coronary thrombosis in most cases. [34,35] More than 50% of patients who
experience acute MI (AMI) and SCA do not have pre-existing symptoms or a known history of CAD. [36,37] In long-term endurance athletes, SCA and myocardial ischaemia can also occur from ‘demand’
ischaemia due to an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand
resulting from stable calcified plaque and a fixed stenosis. [38] In a study
of United States (US) marathon and half-marathon races, none of the
runners with SCA with serious (>80% coronary artery stenosis in a
proximal left coronary artery or three-vessel disease) coronary atherosclerosis had angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture or
thrombus. [38]

3.4 Incidence of sudden cardiac death in

athletes

Current estimates of the incidence of SCD in competitive athletes
range from almost 1 in a million to 1 in 5000 athletes per year. [17,39,40]

Differences in current estimates are largely due to inconsistent study
methodology and heterogeneous population comparisons.
Because reporting of SCD in athletes is not mandatory in most
countries, studies risk underestimating the true incidence due to
incomplete case ascertainment. For instance, studies using media
reports as their main source to detect incidents of SCD identify only
5 - 56% of cases, even in high-profile competitive athletes. [41][�][44]

Similarly, use of catastrophic insurance claims as the only method for

case identification missed 83% of SCD cases and 92% of all SCA cases
in Minnesota high school athletes. [40,45]

The athlete population being studied also needs to be precisely
defined. Census population statistics, cross-sectional surveys, and
self-reported athlete participation data all produce less reliable calculations. Other study details should also be considered. Does the
study include all cases of SCA (survivors plus deaths) or only SCD?
Does the study include cases occurring at any time (i.e. during exercise, rest, or sleep), or only those that occur during sports? Studies
indicate that 56 - 80% of SCA in young athletes occurs during exercise with the remainder non-exertional. [17,18,46]

Evidence supports that some athletes display a higher risk for SCA
based on sex, race, or sport. [17,40,41,45][�][50] Incidence rates are consistently higher in male athletes than in female athletes, with a relative
risk ranging from 3: 1 to 9: 1 (male: female). [17,45,47][�][49,51,52] Black athletes of African Caribbean descent also have a higher risk than white
athletes. In US college athletes, males had a higher risk than females
(1 in 38 000 vs. 1 in 122 000), and black athletes had a 3.2 times higher
risk than white athletes (1 in 21 000 vs. 1 in 68 000). [17] Male basketball

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


basketball players had a risk of 1 in 5300. [17] Based on available studies
and a systematic review of the literature, a generally accepted annual
incidence of all SCA is approximately 1 in 80 000 in high school-aged
athletes and 1 in 50 000 in college-aged athletes. [50] Male athletes,
black athletes, basketball (US) and soccer (Europe) athletes represent higher risk groups. Limited estimates are available for youth, pro
fessional, and master athletes.

3.5 Aetiology of sudden cardiac death
during exercise
SCD in young athletes is usually caused by a genetic or congenital
structural cardiac disorder. [17][�][19,42,53,54] However, autopsy-negative
sudden unexplained death (AN-SUD), also referred to as sudden
arrhythmic death syndrome, is reported on post-mortem examination in up to 44% of presumed SCD cases depending on the study
population. [17,28,42,53][�][56] In apparently healthy young athletes the
prevalence of cardiac disorders associated with SCD is approximately 0.3%, and this figure is supported by multiple studies using

non-invasive evaluation tools to detect cardiac disorders at elevated
risk of SCD. [20,57][�][65]

In athletes >35 years of age, more than 80% of all SCD is due to
atherosclerotic CAD, and vigorous physical exertion is associated
with an increased risk of AMI and SCD. [34,66][�][70] The athletes at greatest risk are those with little or no background in systematic training.

3.6 Screening modalities for
cardiovascular disease in young athletes
Most experts believe that early detection of potentially lethal disorders in athletes can decrease CV morbidity and mortality through
risk stratification, disease-specific interventions, and/or exercise modifications. [22,57,58,71] CV screening by history and physical examination
or by electrocardiogram (ECG) presents unique challenges and limitations. Several studies have documented the low sensitivity and high
positive response rate of pre-participation history questionnaires. [64,65,72][�][75] In CV screening studies in which experienced
clinicians use contemporary ECG interpretation standards, ECG
screening outperforms history and physical examination in all statistical measures of performance. [58,59,62,64,65,74,76]

While echocardiography may identify additional structural disorders, there is insufficient evidence to recommend an echocardiogram
for routine screening. [77]

3.7 Screening for cardiovascular disease
in older athletes

The recommendations and evidence base for CV screening in athletes >35 years of age are limited. CV screening in adult and senior
athletes must target the higher prevalence of atherosclerotic CAD.
However, routine screening for ischaemia with exercise testing in
asymptomatic adults has a low positive predictive value and a high
number of false-positive tests and is not recommended. [78][�][80]

A screening ECG may still discover undiagnosed cardiomyopathies
and primary electrical disorders in older athletes, and risk factor
assessment for CVD may identify higher risk individuals who warrant
additional testing. Thus, consistent with a 2017 ESC position paper
on pre-participation CV screening, exercise ECG testing should be
reserved for symptomatic athletes or those deemed at high risk of


Exercise-induced ACS are most likely to affect adult and senior
athletes and result from atherosclerotic plaque disruption and coronary thrombosis in most cases. [34,35] More than 50% of patients who
experience acute MI (AMI) and SCA do not have pre-existing symptoms or a known history of CAD. [36,37] In long-term endurance athletes, SCA and myocardial ischaemia can also occur from ‘demand’
ischaemia due to an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand
resulting from stable calcified plaque and a fixed stenosis. [38] In a study
of United States (US) marathon and half-marathon races, none of the
runners with SCA with serious (>80% coronary artery stenosis in a
proximal left coronary artery or three-vessel disease) coronary atherosclerosis had angiographic evidence of acute plaque rupture or
thrombus. [38]


3.4 Incidence of sudden cardiac death in

athletes

Current estimates of the incidence of SCD in competitive athletes
range from almost 1 in a million to 1 in 5000 athletes per year. [17,39,40]

Differences in current estimates are largely due to inconsistent study
methodology and heterogeneous population comparisons.
Because reporting of SCD in athletes is not mandatory in most
countries, studies risk underestimating the true incidence due to
incomplete case ascertainment. For instance, studies using media

case identification missed 83% of SCD cases and 92% of all SCA cases
in Minnesota high school athletes. [40,45]

risk ranging from 3: 1 to 9: 1 (male: female). [17,45,47][�][49,51,52] Black athletes of African Caribbean descent also have a higher risk than white
athletes. In US college athletes, males had a higher risk than females
(1 in 38 000 vs. 1 in 122 000), and black athletes had a 3.2 times higher
risk than white athletes (1 in 21 000 vs. 1 in 68 000). [17] Male basketball
players had the highest annual risk of SCD (1 in 9000), and male black

(SCORE) system (see chapters 4 and 5). [6,81]

Exercise testing may also be useful to evaluate the blood pressure
(BP) response to exercise, the occurrence of exercise-induced
arrhythmias, and to assess symptoms or physical performance and its
relation to exercise training. [81] In adult and elderly individuals, especially those naı¨ve to moderate to vigorous PA, exercise testing or cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a useful means to assess
overall CV health and performance, allowing individualized recommendations regarding sports and exercise type and intensity, as will
be discussed in subsequent sections. [82]
### 4. Physical activity, leisure exercise, and competitive sports participation

4.1 General introduction

Recommendations for prescription of exercise require a basic knowledge of physiological responses to exercise, along with an understanding of concepts and characteristics of PA, exercise
interventions, and their implications for sports participation.
Although exercise and PA are often used interchangeably, it is important to recognize that these terms differ. PA is defined as any bodily
movement produced by the skeletal muscle that results in energy
expenditure. Exercise or exercise training, on the other hand, by definition, is PA that is structured, repetitive, and purposeful to improve
or maintain one or more components of physical fitness. [83]

Physical fitness may be expressed by five major components
(Figure 1): [83] a morphological component (body mass relative to

. [................................................................................................]


visceral fat, bone density, and flexibility); [84] a muscular component
(power or explosive strength, isometric strength, muscular endurance); [85] a motor component (agility, balance, coordination, speed of
movement); [85] a cardiorespiratory component (endurance or submaximal exercise capacity, maximal aerobic power, heart function,
lung function, BP); and a metabolic component (glucose tolerance,
insulin sensitivity, lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, substrate oxidation characteristics). [86]

4.1.1 Definition and characteristics of exercise

interventions

The basic tenets of exercise prescription have been described using
the ‘FITT’ concept (frequency, intensity, time, and type). The mode of
exercise (Table 3) is also an important characteristic. The following
sections will describe each of these components related to aerobic
exercise followed by components of strength exercise.

4.1.1.1 Type of exercise
Traditionally, different forms of exercise are classified in binary terms
as endurance or resistance (strength) exercise. However, this classification is somewhat oversimplified. Further classifications of exercise
are metabolically related (aerobic vs. anaerobic exercise) or those
related to the type of muscle contraction: isotonic [contraction
against resistance in which the length of the muscle shortens (concentric) or lengthens (eccentric)] and isometric (static or without
change in length of the muscle).
Aerobic exercise refers to activity performed at an intensity that
allows metabolism of stored energy to occur mainly through aerobic
glycolysis. Besides the glycolytic pathway, fat metabolism (b-oxidation)
is also involved during aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise involves
large muscle groups performing dynamic activities, resulting in


Exercise testing may also be useful to evaluate the blood pressure
(BP) response to exercise, the occurrence of exercise-induced
arrhythmias, and to assess symptoms or physical performance and its
relation to exercise training. [81] In adult and elderly individuals, especially those naı¨ve to moderate to vigorous PA, exercise testing or cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a useful means to assess
overall CV health and performance, allowing individualized recommendations regarding sports and exercise type and intensity, as will

substantial increases in heart rate and energy expenditure. Examples
of aerobic exercise include cycling, running, and swimming performed
at low to moderate intensity. [84] In contrast, anaerobic exercise refers
to movement performed at high intensity unsustainable by oxygen
delivery alone and requiring metabolism of stored energy to be processed largely by anaerobic glycolysis. A sustained isometric muscle
action that is not working maximally but does not necessarily depend
entirely upon oxygen during the muscle contraction is an example of
anaerobic exercise. Another example of anaerobic exercise is intermittent high-intensity exercise. [85]

4.1.1.2 Exercise frequency
Exercise frequency is usually expressed as the number of times an
individual engages in exercise per week. Guidelines suggest that moderate exercise should be performed most days of the week, amounting to a minimum of 150 min/week.

4.1.1.3 Exercise intensity
Of all the basic elements of exercise prescription, exercise intensity is
generally considered to be the most critical for achieving aerobic fitness and to have the most favourable impact on risk factors. [86,87]

Absolute intensity refers to the rate of energy expenditure during
exercise and is usually expressed in kcal/min or metabolic equivalents


. [.......................................................................................................................................................................]


(METs). [84,88] Relative exercise intensity refers to a fraction of an individual’s maximal power (load) that is maintained during exercise and
is usually prescribed as a percentage of maximal aerobic capacity
(VO 2max ) on the basis of a CPET. [88] Training intensity can also be
expressed as a percentage of maximal heart rate (HR max ) recorded
during an exercise test [89] or predicted on the basis of the equation

[HR max = 220 - age]. [90] The use of prediction equations for HR max is
not recommended, because there is a large standard deviation
around the regression line between age and HR max . [91] Alternatively,
exercise intensity can be expressed relative to a percentage of a person’s HR reserve (HRR), which uses a percentage of the difference
between HR max and resting HR and adds it to the resting HR
(Karvonen formula). [92] There are caveats to the use of HR for prescribing and evaluating exercise intensity in persons using beta-blockers. [93] Ideally, the HR derived for training should only be used if
functional capacity was determined (an exercise test was performed)
while taking the medication. Intensity is also commonly monitored
using the rate of perceived exertion scale (e.g. 12- 14 on the Borg
6- 20 scale) or ‘talk test’, e.g. ‘to be able to talk while exercising’. [91,94]

General zones for various exercise intensities are shown in Table 4.

4.1.1.4 Training volume
Exercise intensity is inversely related to exercise time. Their product (in kcal or kJ) defines the volume of each training unit, which in
turn multiplied by frequency provides an estimate of the energy
expenditure of the training bout or session. The frequency of
training sessions and the duration of the training period provide
total energy expenditure of a training programme. Meeting the
minimal activity guidelines equates to approximately 1000 kcal/
week or about 10 MET/h/week (the product of MET level and
duration in hours per week). Training volume should increase
weekly either by 2.5% in intensity [95] or 2 mins’ duration, [95] although
the rate of progression should be individualized according to the
biological adaptation of the individual. Training adaptation is also
influenced by age, genetics, [96] fitness, and environmental factors,
such as hydration, heat, cold, and altitude. [97]

4.1.1.5 Type of training

Aerobic training. Aerobic exercise training can either be continuous
or interval based. There is a plethora of evidence and many guidelines
on continuous aerobic exercise, but there is also strong evidence
emerging about the benefits of interval-type training. The interval
design involves the completion of short bouts of exercise at high
intensities, interspersed with recovery periods. When compared
with continuous training, this approach provides a greater challenge
to the cardiopulmonary, peripheral, and metabolic systems and
results in a more efficient training effect. [98] Interval training has been
reported to be motivating, since the traditional continuous training
can often be tedious. Interval training should be employed only in stable cardiac patients because it places a higher stress on the CV system. [99] Since intermittent training exposes subjects to near maximal
effort, rest intervals of appropriate duration, preferably active ones,
are recommended. [100] The exercise to rest ratio varies. [101] There are

a number of different approaches used, which should be individualized according to fitness and comorbidities.

ESC Guidelines 29


Resistance training. Exercise intensity: The intensity of resistance
exercise is typically prescribed in terms of one repetition maximum
(1 RM). One RM is defined as the maximum amount of weight a person can lift throughout a range of motion with one repetition. Even
though the performance of 1 RM appears to be a safe approach for
evaluating strength [102] and no significant CV events have been
reported using this approach, [103] for convenience and compliance
reasons the use of multiple (usually five) repetitions (5 RM) is suggested. Five RM is the maximum amount of weight that can be performed five times. It has been reported that 1 RM can be accurately
estimated from multiple repetitions and that 5 RM is an appropriate
reflection of maximal strength. [104]

Exercise training zones: Resistance training using less than 20% 1 RM is
generally considered aerobic endurance training. With more than
20% 1 RM, the muscular capillaries become compressed during
muscle contraction resulting in a hypoxic stimulus responsible for
training effects. The number of repetitions should be inversely related
to the training intensity. A moderate training intensity of 30�50% 1
RM with 15�30 repetitions is considered muscular endurance training. Higher training intensities of 50�70% 1 RM with 8�15 repetitions are optimal for strength gains.
Training volume: Optimal strength gains occur when resistance

�
training is performed 2 3 times per week. Approaches to resistance training often follow either a station or a circuit approach. In
the former approach, individuals typically complete all of the sets
for a given exercise per muscle group before moving to another
exercise and muscle group. In the latter approach, individuals typically perform one set of a given muscle group and then rotate to
another exercise and muscle group until the full set of exercises in
completed per muscle group. One to three sets of 8�15 . [..........................................................................................]


repetitions should be performed including flexion and extension
of each muscle group. Multiple sets are superior to a single set. [105]

�
A variety of 8 10 resistance exercises should be prescribed to
cover most of the muscular groups. [88] Muscular power is best

maintained when 3�5 min rest intervals are used instead of short
rest intervals (<1 min). [106]

Mode of training: Resistance training can either be isometric (i.e.
unchanged muscle length without joint movement) or dynamic (contraction with change in length of the muscle and movement of the
joint throughout a range of motion). Isometric (static) muscle actions
may induce a Valsalva manoeuvre at moderate to high loads, if it is
not intentionally prevented by regular breathing, and may lead to an
unnecessary fluctuation of BP. Dynamic training may include constant
or variable resistance through the range of motion using either free
weights or weight machines. In both of these modes, the type of contraction and the velocity of movement vary throughout the range of
motion. This type of muscle activity mirrors muscle loading faced in
daily activity. Muscles can contract in a concentric fashion, in which
muscle shortening is exhibited during the movement, or eccentric
fashion, in which a lengthening of the muscle occurs. Resistance training is an advanced application in which participants carry out a series
of rapid concentric and eccentric muscle actions often at a relatively
high load.

4.1.2 Classification of exercise and sports
A precise classification of sports by using the different components of
FITT is difficult because of the differences in the type of muscular
work, the mode, and the volume and intensity of exercise. Moreover,
most sports consist of an isotonic and isometric muscular


Figure 2 Sporting discipline in relation to the predominant component (skill, power, mixed, and endurance) and intensity of exercise. Intensity of exercise must be individualized after maximal exercise testing, field testing and/or after muscular strength testing (Table 2).

30 ESC Guidelines


component. For example, resistance activities can be performed in a
predominantly dynamic manner or a predominantly static manner.
Some sports require a high motor control component and level of
skill, whereas other sports are performed at a low, moderate, high,
or very high intensity. These intensities can vary depending upon the
type of sport or the professional, amateur, or recreational level of
performing the sports.
When providing advice regarding an exercise programme or
sports participation, the physician should indicate: (i) the type of
sport; (ii) frequency and duration of the exercise programme; and (iii)
the intensity that appears most appropriate to the individual.

(1) Regarding the choice of the most convenient sport, the physician

may indicate the type of sport as illustrated in Figure 2 (skill, power,

mixed, or endurance), with specification of the frequency, duration,

and intensity of muscular work to be preferentially maintained dur
ing the exercise programme.

(2) In order to adequately prescribe the individual intensity of an endur
ance or mixed type of exercise or sports, the individual should per
form a maximal exercise test with 12-lead ECG recording or

preferentially, if possible, with simultaneous measurement of respi
ratory gas exchange (CPET).

Knowing a person’s maximal exercise capacity allows the health
professional to determine a personally tailored exercise programme
that is safe and most likely to be effective. The exercise test permits
the formulation of the appropriate exercise prescription based on
well-recognized indices including heart rate reserve (HRR = HR max HR rest ), VO 2 reserve, the ventilatory threshold, or percentage of
work rate for a given individual.
The exercise test also permits an assessment of any abnormal CV
responses that might not otherwise be apparent during usual daily
activities (including symptoms, ECG abnormalities, arrhythmias, or
abnormal BP response). Based on the exercise testing results, the
physician may indicate the intensity, mode, and duration of exercise
that appears most suitable to the individual patient (see Table 4).
For power sports or resistance training, additionally maximal muscular testing is warranted in order to determine 1 RM or 5 RM. . [................................................................................................................]


Percentage of these values, number of repetitions, and number of

series will enable determination of the CV and muscular demand.

Additionally, field tests will facilitate appropriate prescriptions, mainly
for team sports.
When prescribing power sports for individuals with CVD, one
should also consider the type of muscular work: isometric (static) or
isotonic (dynamic) strength exercises. Additionally, the type and
amount of exercise training, when preparing for a sport, is very
important. The amount of exercise work should be adapted gradually
according to the subject’s actual exercise tolerance and to the anticipated level of performance.

4.2 Exercise recommendations in

individuals with cardiovascular risk

factors

4.2.1 General introduction

Exercise has a positive effect on several risk factors for atherosclerosis. [6] Regular exercise reduces the risk of many adverse health outcomes irrespective of age, sex, ethnicity, or the presence of

�
comorbidities. Indeed, there is a dose effect relationship between
exercise and CV and all-cause mortality, with a 20�30% reduction in
adverse events compared with sedentary individuals. [107,108]

Consequently, European Guidelines recommend that healthy adults
of all ages should perform a minimum of 150 min of moderateintensity endurance exercise training over 5 days or 75 min of vigorous exercise per week over 3 days, with additional benefit derived
by doubling the amount to 300 min of moderate-intensity or 150 min
of vigorous-intensity aerobic PA per week. [6]

While exercise is also beneficial in patients with established CVD,
the risk associated with vigorous exercise and sports in these individuals is increased. Importantly, CVD may be subclinical and unrecognized; therefore, consideration should be given to pre-participation
assessment of risk in individuals with a higher likelihood of CVD.
Individuals with multiple risk factors are more likely to develop CVD.
Assessment of the individual likelihood of subclinical CVD may be
performed by calculating the accumulated risk through established
risk scores such as the SCORE risk charts (Figure 3) and considering


(1) Regarding the choice of the most convenient sport, the physician

may indicate the type of sport as illustrated in Figure 2 (skill, power,

mixed, or endurance), with specification of the frequency, duration,

and intensity of muscular work to be preferentially maintained dur
ing the exercise programme.

(2) In order to adequately prescribe the individual intensity of an endur
ance or mixed type of exercise or sports, the individual should per
form a maximal exercise test with 12-lead ECG recording or

preferentially, if possible, with simultaneous measurement of respi
ratory gas exchange (CPET).


Knowing a person’s maximal exercise capacity allows the health
professional to determine a personally tailored exercise programme
that is safe and most likely to be effective. The exercise test permits
the formulation of the appropriate exercise prescription based on
well-recognized indices including heart rate reserve (HRR = HR max HR rest ), VO 2 reserve, the ventilatory threshold, or percentage of
work rate for a given individual.
The exercise test also permits an assessment of any abnormal CV
responses that might not otherwise be apparent during usual daily
activities (including symptoms, ECG abnormalities, arrhythmias, or
abnormal BP response). Based on the exercise testing results, the
physician may indicate the intensity, mode, and duration of exercise
that appears most suitable to the individual patient (see Table 4).
For power sports or resistance training, additionally maximal muscular testing is warranted in order to determine 1 RM or 5 RM.

a Adapted from refs 84,85 using training zones related to aerobic and anaerobic thresholds. Low-intensity exercise is below the aerobic threshold; moderate is above the aerobic
threshold but not reaching the anaerobic zone; high intensity is close to the anaerobic zone; and very intense exercise is above the anaerobic threshold. The duration of exercise will also largely influence this division in intensity.

individual risk factors such as very high total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL), diabetes mellitus, or a strong family history
of CVD. [6] Based on this assessment the individual CV risk can be cate
gorized from low to very high risk (Table 5).
Preliminary evaluation should consist of a self-assessment relating
to symptoms and calculation of SCORE. Individuals who are habitually active and at low or moderate risk should not have any restrictions for exercise including competitive sports. Sedentary individuals
and individuals at high or very high risk may engage in low-intensity
exercise without further evaluation. Sedentary individuals and/or
those at high or very high risk planning to undertake high-intensity

exercise as well as selected individuals planning to undertake
moderate-intensity exercise should undergo a physical examination,

12-lead ECG, and exercise stress test. The aim of the exercise test is

to identify prognostically important CAD and to assess the presence
of exercise-induced arrhythmias. Individuals with symptoms, abnormal findings on physical examination, abnormal ECG, or abnormal
exercise test should be investigated further according to current ESC
Guidelines for chronic coronary syndromes. [110] Following normal
investigations, there should be no restrictions to sports participation.
All individuals should, however, be thoroughly informed that development of symptoms during exercise should prompt reassessment.
While a normal exercise test and a high exercise capacity is associated with a good prognosis, the test has limited sensitivity in diagnosing mild to moderate obstructive CAD. [111,112] Currently there is no
evidence for incorporating routine cardiac imaging in preparticipation screening among asymptomatic individuals aged >35
years old with a normal exercise stress test. However, in asymptomatic adults considered to be at high risk or very high risk (diabetes,
strong family history of CAD, previous risk assessment suggesting
high risk for CAD) a functional imaging test or coronary computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) should be considered in the risk
assessment (Figure 4). [110] Identification of atherosclerotic CAD should
prompt aggressive management of risk factors and preventive medical treatment. Among individuals with proven obstructive CAD, fur
ther assessment and treatment is indicated.

4.2.2 Obesity
A person with a body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m [2] or (preferentially)

a waist circumference >94 cm for males and >80 cm for females
(both for European Caucasians) is considered obese. [120,121]

European guidelines for obese individuals recommend that a minimum of 150 min/week of moderate-intensity endurance exercise
training should be combined with three weekly sessions of resistance
exercise. [121] Such intervention leads to a reduction in intra-abdominal

fat mass, increments in muscle and bone mass, attenuation in the

weight loss-induced decline of resting energy expenditure, reduction
in BP and chronic inflammation, and improvement in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and physical fitness. [121,122] There
is also a positive influence on the long-term maintenance of weight
reduction, general well-being and self-esteem, and reduction in anxiety and depression. [121] The impact of exercise intervention alone on
fat mass is modest. [123] According to a series of large randomized controlled trials a high endurance-type exercise volume, >225 min/week,
is required to maximize fat mass loss in obese individuals. [124]

A pre-participation CV assessment is warranted in obese individuals who intend to engage in high-intensity exercise (Figure 4),
due to associated comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and CV and respiratory diseases. [121] Obese
individuals with a normal CV assessment should not have any
restrictions on exercise. There is evidence from healthy, nonobese and non-athletic individuals that running, and abrupt
increases in training volume, contribute to musculoskeletal
injuries. [125][�][127] Therefore, it may be reasonable to consider that
obese individuals should limit high-volume weight-bearing exercises on a hard surface (i.e. <2 h/day) until a considerable

reduction in body weight is achieved. Moreover, if high-volume
exercise (>2 h/day) is desired, a sufficient recovery time should be
allowed for between periods of exercise (optimally 48 h). It is
important to emphasize that good physical and muscular fitness
and neuromuscular coordination may protect obese individuals
from musculoskeletal injuries, hence non-weight-bearing exercises such as cycling or swimming [128] may be beneficial. Finally,
there is no compelling evidence that resistance training, when
executed properly, will increase the risk for musculoskeletal injuries or provoke musculoskeletal symptoms in obese
individuals. [129]

4.2.3 Hypertension
A person with a persistent systolic BP (SBP) >_140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) >_90 mmHg is considered hypertensive. [130,131]

Hypertensive individuals should participate in at least 30 min of
moderate-intense dynamic aerobic exercise (walking, jogging, cycling,
or swimming) for 5�7 days per week. [132] Such exercise intervention
is associated with a mean reduction in SBP of 7 mmHg and DBP of 5
mmHg. [133] Additional resistance training is highly effective in reducing

�
BP further and resistance training 2 3 days per week is also
advised. [132] Indeed, the BP-lowering effect of resistance and isometric
exercise may be comparable to, or even greater than, that of aerobic
exercise. [134]

If high-intensity sports participation is desired, a pre-participation
CV assessment is warranted to identify athletes with exerciseinduced symptoms, excessive BP response to exercise [130], and the
presence of end organ damage. Individuals with symptoms suggestive
of CAD require further assessment and optimization of medical therapy before participation in sports. If arterial hypertension is poorly
controlled (resting SBP > 160 mmHg), a maximal exercise test should
be postponed until the BP is controlled.
Non-pharmacological measures should be considered as the
first step in the management of hypertension in athletes, including: restriction of salt intake and alcohol consumption, weight
reduction if applicable, balanced diet (e.g. Mediterranean diet),
and cessation of smoking. Aerobic exercise programmes should
herein complement the individual’s training schedule. [131] If such
lifestyle changes do not lower BP after 3 months, antihypertensive drugs should be commenced if SBP remains >140 mmHg.
Antihypertensive therapy alongside lifestyle intervention should
be considered in all individuals aged >65 years but <80 years,
provided it is well tolerated. [131,132] It is important to consider
that beta-blockers are prohibited in certain competitive skill
sports such as shooting [see World Anti-Doping Association
(WADA) for complete list [135] ], and can induce bradycardia and/
or lower aerobic exercise capacity. [131] Diuretics are prohibited in
all competitive sports. [135] Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists are the preferred drugs of choice in exercising individuals. It
is noteworthy that the use of non-selective non-steroidal . [.............................................................................................................................................................]


inflammatory drugs for musculoskeletal pain may contribute to
raised BP. [136]

When BP is uncontrolled, temporary restriction from competitive
sports is recommended, with the possible exception of skill sports. [131]

In individuals with a high-risk profile, including those with end organ
damage [left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction,
ultrasound evidence of arterial wall thickening or atherosclerotic plaque, hypertensive retinopathy, increased serum creatinine (men
1.3�1.5 mg/dL, women 1.2�1.4 mg/dL), and/or microalbuminuria]
in whom BP is controlled, participation in all competitive sports is
possible, with the exception of the most intensive power disciplines
such as discus/javelin throwing, shot-putting, and weightlifting (see
section 4.1). [131]

During sports participation, regular follow-up is recommended
depending on the severity of hypertension and the category of risk. In
individuals with borderline BP readings, regular ambulatory assess
ment of BP should be considered. In individuals with low or moderate

CV risk and well-controlled BP, there should be no restrictions to

sports participation, however, intensive heavy weightlifting, especially
when this includes substantial isometric (static) muscle work, can
have a marked pressor effect and should be avoided. In this
context, avoiding the Valsalva manoeuvre in particular is warranted
because breath holding during muscular contraction is associated
with a greater elevation in SBP and DBP. [135] When executed correctly, high-intense dynamic resistance training (up to 80% of 1 RM),
with a low number of repetitions (n < 10) does not induce greater
increments in BP compared with low-intense dynamic resistance
training (<50% of 1 RM) with a high number of repetitions (n >_
20). [137][�][142]

Some individuals who are normotensive at rest will have an exaggerated BP response to exercise. An exaggerated BP response to
exercise increases the risk for incident hypertension in highly trained
and normotensive athletes over a middle-term period. [143] If SBP rises
to >200 mmHg at a workload of 100 W during exercise testing, [144]

antihypertensive medical therapy should be optimized and clinical
evaluation, including ECG and echocardiography, should be considered, even if the athlete is normotensive at rest. [131] Moreover, in

young Olympic athletes a peak SBP of >220 mmHg in males and
>200 mmHg in females measured during cycle ergometry are beyond
the 95th percentile. [131]

4.2.4 Dyslipidaemia
Physical activity has favourable effects on lipid metabolism by reducing serum triglycerides by up to 50% and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 5�10%. [85,145] Exercise may also
reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 5% and shift the more atherogenic
small, dense LDL fraction towards larger LDL particles in a dosedependent fashion. [146] These metabolic improvements can be
achieved through 3.5 - 7 h of moderately vigorous PA per week or
30 - 60 min of exercise on most days.
In individuals with hypertriglyceridaemia or hypercholesterolaemia, a higher intensity of exercise is recommended, as this may

36 ESC Guidelines


improve the lipid profile and reduce CV risk. Before embarking on
high-intensity exercise, a clinical assessment should be performed
including symptomatic status, and a maximal exercise stress test,
functional imaging test, or CCTA may be considered in the risk
assessment [110] (Figure 4), particularly in individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Among athletes with hypercholesterolaemia, regular exercise will rarely reduce LDL cholesterol to normal or nearnormal values; therefore, guidelines on pharmacological treatment in
primary and secondary prevention should be followed strictly.
Individuals with dyslipidaemia should be assessed at least every 2�5
years for primary prevention and annually for secondary prevention.
Pharmacological intervention, particularly with statins, is superior
to exercise and lifestyle intervention alone for reducing LDL cholesterol and improving prognosis. [147] Despite the minor effects of endurance exercise on serum LDL cholesterol, the clinically beneficial
relationship between increased physical fitness and reduced CV
events remains beyond the effects of statins. [147,148]

Physically active individuals with dyslipidaemia may experience
muscle pain and soreness or tendinopathy accompanied by elevated
muscle enzymes. [149] In these cases, measures such as stopping medication temporarily followed by repeat challenge with another statin
drug, with or without an alternate day regimen, or introducing other
lipid-lowering agents such as ezetimibe or proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors should be considered. [109]

Individuals who develop rhabdomyolysis due to a statin should be
prescribed an alternative lipid-lowering agent.

4.2.5 Diabetes mellitus

Physical inactivity is a major cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus

�
(T2DM). [150] The risk of developing T2DM is 50 80% higher in individuals who are physically inactive compared to their active counterparts. However, exercise does not entirely compensate for the effect
of obesity. [151][�][154] Diabetes is also independently associated with an
accelerated decline in muscular strength and, partly because of
hyperglycaemia, may lead to reduced joint mobility.

4.2.5.1 Effect of exercise on diabetic control, risk factors and outcomes
Aerobic exercise in patients with T2DM improves glycaemic control

and reduces visceral fat and insulin resistance. Exercise also has bene
ficial effects on BP and lipid profile, and leads to modest weight
loss. [155,156] Both aerobic and resistance training promote prolonged
adaptations in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver associated
with enhanced insulin action. [157] Observational studies have shown

lower mortality with exercise in both type 1 diabetes mellitus and
T2DM. [158]

In patients with pre-diabetes or metabolic syndrome, both aerobic
and resistance exercise may prevent the development of overt diabetes. [159][�][162] Intensity of exercise seems to be of greater importance

than the volume of exercise; individuals who exercise at moderate or

high intensity have a lower risk of developing metabolic impairment
compared with those who have a similar energy expenditure at a

[160,163] . [...............................................................................................................................................................]


The effects on muscle insulin sensitivity are observed with a relatively low volume of exercise (400 kcal/week) in previously sedentary
adults, but increase with higher volumes of exercise. [164] The optimal
combination of duration and intensity is not well established. Highintensity interval training may be superior to moderate aerobic training in achieving metabolic effects and improvement in exercise
capacity; however, whether long-term results are superior is
unknown. [165,166]

Diabetes is a cause of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD),
which is associated with lower exercise capacity and adverse outcomes [167,168] and can be improved by exercise training. [162,169][�][171]

Large randomized trials have confirmed the beneficial effect of exercise intervention on glycaemic control and risk factors, but this has
not translated into a significant improvement in survival, partly
because of suboptimal long-term maintenance of lifestyle changes. [172]

During an acute bout of exercise, glucose uptake in the muscles is
increased for up to 2 h afterwards through mechanisms that are independent of insulin. The exercise-induced hypoglycaemic effect can be
diminished by performing resistance training or interval training in
patients with type 1 diabetes. [173] There is a dose�response relationship between intensity and volume of exercise and duration of glucose uptake by skeletal muscle that may last up to 48 h after exercise.

These factors must be considered in individuals with diabetes who

are undertaking intensive exercise or competitive sports in order to
avoid hypoglycaemia.

4.2.5.2 Recommendations for participation in exercise in individuals with

diabetes mellitus

Both aerobic and resistance training are effective for glycaemic control, BP reduction, weight loss, peak exercise capacity, and dyslipidemia. [174] A programme combining aerobic and resistance training has
been shown to be superior in terms of glycaemic control, whereas
the effect on other outcomes is unproven. [174][�][176]

The ideal exercise programme to achieve the full potential of benefits in patients with diabetes is daily exercise of at least moderate
intensity, e.g. brisk walking, for at least 30 min, resistance training for
15 min on most days, and lighter-intensity activities (standing, walking) every 30 min. This can be supplemented by flexibility and balance
exercise, particularly in older individuals or patients with microvascular complications due to their diabetes.

4.2.5.3 Cardiac evaluation before exercise participation in individuals

with diabetes mellitus

Individuals with diabetes have a priori a higher likelihood of subclinical
CAD; therefore, all individuals with diabetes should undergo CV
assessment as outlined in Figure 4 before taking up an exercise programme of high intensity. This should be supplemented by an evaluation of glycaemic status, including risk factors for hypoglycaemia,
history of hypoglycaemic episodes, presence of autonomic neuropathy, and antidiabetic treatment. [177]

Asymptomatic individuals with diabetes mellitus and a normal CV
assessment and maximal exercise test may engage in all sports but
should be warned about the potential risk of iatrogenic


Physically active individuals with dyslipidaemia may experience
muscle pain and soreness or tendinopathy accompanied by elevated
muscle enzymes. [149] In these cases, measures such as stopping medication temporarily followed by repeat challenge with another statin
drug, with or without an alternate day regimen, or introducing other
lipid-lowering agents such as ezetimibe or proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors should be considered. [109]

Individuals who develop rhabdomyolysis due to a statin should be
prescribed an alternative lipid-lowering agent.


4.2.5 Diabetes mellitus

Physical inactivity is a major cause of type 2 diabetes mellitus

�
(T2DM). [150] The risk of developing T2DM is 50 80% higher in individuals who are physically inactive compared to their active counterparts. However, exercise does not entirely compensate for the effect
of obesity. [151][�][154] Diabetes is also independently associated with an
accelerated decline in muscular strength and, partly because of
hyperglycaemia, may lead to reduced joint mobility.


4.2.5.1 Effect of exercise on diabetic control, risk factors and outcomes
Aerobic exercise in patients with T2DM improves glycaemic control

and reduces visceral fat and insulin resistance. Exercise also has bene
ficial effects on BP and lipid profile, and leads to modest weight
loss. [155,156] Both aerobic and resistance training promote prolonged
adaptations in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver associated
with enhanced insulin action. [157] Observational studies have shown

lower mortality with exercise in both type 1 diabetes mellitus and
T2DM. [158]

In patients with pre-diabetes or metabolic syndrome, both aerobic
and resistance exercise may prevent the development of overt diabetes. [159][�][162] Intensity of exercise seems to be of greater importance

than the volume of exercise; individuals who exercise at moderate or

high intensity have a lower risk of developing metabolic impairment
compared with those who have a similar energy expenditure at a
lower intensity. [160,163]

hypoglycaemia in the event of inadequate caloric intake. Importantly,
all patients with diabetes should be aware of warning symptoms and
attention should be given to chest discomfort or unusual breathlessness during exercise as this may be indicative of CAD.

4.3 Exercise and sports in ageing

4.3.1 Introduction

The elderly are defined as adults aged above 65 years. Similar to the
general population, higher exercise capacity in this age group is also
associated with reduced mortality. [179] A physically active lifestyle
maintained through middle and older age translates into better
health [180] and longevity. [181][�][185] Commencing a new exercise regimen
among sedentary elderly individuals has shown significant health
improvements [180,186] including cognitive capacity. [187][�][190] Moreover,
regular exercise exerts beneficial effects in reducing the risk of developing CV and metabolic disease through improved control of CV risk
factors, [191,192] also preserving cognitive function. [187][�][190] Importantly,
exercise helps to preserve neuromuscular competence, [193,194] thus
maintaining balance and coordination, which reduces the risk of

[195,196] . [.......................................................................................................................................................................]


4.3.2 Risk stratification, inclusion/exclusion criteria

Moderate-intensity exercise is generally safe for older healthy people
and medical consultation before starting or progressing the level of
exercise programme is not usually required. [81,197] The general recommendation for exercise implementation for the general population
also applies to healthy elderly people.
Nevertheless, due to potential risks of exercising among the elderly (Table 6), the European Association of Preventive Cardiology
(EAPC) recommends self-assessment by a brief questionnaire [81] to
determine the need for advice from health professionals, but this
approach has not been tested prospectively.
Community-dwelling frail or sedentary older adults may have a
slightly increased risk of falls during exercise; however, there is no
evidence of serious adverse outcomes, injury, or CV
events. [195,196,198,199] Exercise interventions to improve balance in
those diagnosed with dementia bring numerous benefits without an
increased risk of adverse outcomes. [200] Resistance exercise in older
adults is rarely associated with adverse events. [201,202] No major risks
have been reported in older individuals performing low- and
moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, and even more intense aerobic
activities are associated with a relatively small risk. [203][�][205] CV events
during intense exercise occur at a rate of around 1 event per 100
years of vigorous activity. [206] Risks are highest during the first few
weeks of beginning vigorous exercise; therefore both exercise intensity and duration should be increased gently (for example, every 4
weeks). [81,197,207][�][210] Among older individuals who are well prepared
and accustomed to intense exercise, participation in competitive vigorous sports does not confer higher risk compared with younger
adults. [38,211]

4.3.3 Exercise modalities and recommendations for

exercise and sport in the elderly
The physical exercises for elderly persons should be designed
according to their biological age, exercise experience, functional
capacity, safety, ageing trajectories, comorbidity, lifestyle habits, and
previous experience of exercise.
Elderly people should perform endurance and strength exercise,
and specific exercises for flexibility and balance (Table 7). [201,212,213]

Endurance exercise exerts beneficial effects on the cardiorespiratory
system and resistance exercise prevents the decrease in muscle mass
and sarcopenia. [192] Achieving >150 min/week moderate-intensity
aerobic exercise (i.e. walking or other moderate intensity aerobicstype activities) is associated with at least 30% lower risk of morbidity,
mortality, disability, frailty, and dementia compared with being inactive. [212,214,215] The strength exercises for the major muscle groups

�
should be performed at least twice a week (8 10 different exercises,
10�15 repetitions).
Accustomed senior athletes should continue performing exercise
and sports activities, without any predetermined age limit. [38,211,216]

Sports activities for older people according to exercise type and
intensity are reported in Table 8. Annual clinical assessment including
a maximal exercise test (preferably with simultaneous CPET) is recommended in master athletes performing a high level of sports and
exercise programmes. [217]

participation in chronic coronary
syndrome
Atherosclerotic CAD is the predominant cause of exercise-related
(Ex-R) cardiac events including ACS, AMI, and SCA in individuals with
established chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), or SCD as a primary
presentation in individuals >35 years of age. [218] In addition to atherosclerotic CAD, other entities, including an anomalous origin of a coronary artery (AOCA), [219] myocardial bridge (MB), [220] and
spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), [221] are also associated with myocardial ischaemia, and potentially with Ex-R SCD.
Physical inactivity is a risk factor for CAD, but somewhat paradoxically, vigorous physical exertion transiently increases the risk for
AMI [66] and SCD. [216] Overall, the benefits of regular exercise greatly
outweigh the Ex-R risk, even in individuals with CCS. Moderate- to

incidence of adverse outcomes from CAD, but prolonged, highintensity endurance exercise has been associated with increased coronary artery calcium (CAC), a marker of atherosclerosis, [58,222] and
coronary plaques [58] but without an increase in mortality [112] in the
medium term. Importantly, the diagnosis of myocardial injury is also
more complex in athletes because intense exercise may increase
serologic markers of myocardial injury, including cardiac troponin I
and T. [223,224]

5.1.1 Individuals at risk of atherosclerotic coronary artery
disease and asymptomatic individuals in whom coronary
artery disease is detected at screening
Athletes or individuals participating in sports or regular exercise
training may have risk factors for CAD and/or subclinical CCS. [225]

Such individuals may be identified by routine pre-participation
screening as recommended by the ESC [21] or by pre-evaluation of
master athletes, as suggested by the European Association for
Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (EACPR) 2011 [207] and
the AHA. [226]

In addition to the SCORE risk stratification described earlier

(Table 5), the increasing use of cardiac imaging techniques allows the
identification of a greater number of individuals with asymptomatic
CCS, [227] including competitive master athletes. [227]

Newer predictive measures, such as high-sensitive C-reactive protein and carotid intima�media thickness (IMT) add little to the traditional risk factors. [110] The exception is CAC, which provides
additional predictive information in individuals with a moderate-risk
profile, [228] dividing them into low- or high-risk individuals. The most
prudent and cost-effective method of utilizing CAC may thus be additive to the traditional risk factors, [229] as suggested by the EAPC. [230]

Clinical evaluation of asymptomatic individuals with possible subclinical CCS should include (Figure 4): [112]

(1) Assessment of risk of CVD [110] (Table 5)

(2) Consideration of intensity of intended exercise programme

(3) Clinical evaluation, including maximal exercise stress test

(4) Further diagnostic testing in selected individuals.

Many middle-aged individuals in the general population can be
expected to have some level of subclinical CCS as assessed with
imaging techniques. Anatomical coronary imaging alone does not
provide information relating to the coronary flow and reserve, which
is important in assessing the risk of Ex-R ischaemia or SCD/SCA;
therefore functional evaluation is necessary. Several methods of
stress testing (e.g. cycle ergometry or treadmill testing), stress echocardiography, adenosine or dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), or positron emission tomography (PET)/single-photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT), can be used to detect
inducible myocardial ischaemia [231] . Exercise stress-echo is preferred

in athletes because it is free from radiation and does not involve

administration of drugs.
Exercise testing is the most widely available functional test, and
provides information on exercise capacity, heart rate, and BP
response, and detection of exercise-induced arrhythmias, [2] but has a


. [................................................................................................................................]

lower specificity for myocardial ischaemia than other functional tests,
especially in asymptomatic and low-risk individuals. It is recommended that a truly maximal exercise test [232] (with or without CPET)
should be performed when evaluating individuals with possible subclinical (or clinical) CCS who intend to or are participating in systematic exercise including recreational or competitive sports. Whether
the initial exercise test includes imaging or not depends on factors
such as the baseline ECG (Table 9) and feasibility of performing functional imaging tests in a given institute.

 - [If the clinical assessment, including a maximal exercise test is][ nor-]

mal, the presence of ‘relevant CAD’ is assumed to be unlikely
(Figure 4).

 - [In the event of a][ borderline][ or uninterpretable exercise test result,]

it is recommended that a more specific imaging stress test is performed such as stress-echocardiography, CMR perfusion imaging,
or SPECT. Maximal exercise SPECT and exercise echocardiography or nuclear perfusion techniques utilizing exercise rather than
pharmacological stress may preferentially be used, depending on
availability and local expertise.

 - [If the exercise test is][ positive][, an invasive coronary angiogram]

should be performed to confirm the presence, extent, and
severity of CAD (Figure 4).

5.1.1.1 Recommendations for sports participation
Individuals at risk of CAD and asymptomatic individuals in whom CAD
is detected at screening should have aggressive management of risk factors for atherosclerosis. [6,131,132,202] Considering the benefits of exercise
on primary and secondary prevention of CCS, [6,234] individuals with risk
factors should be restricted from competitive sport only when there is
substantial risk of an adverse event, as indicated by functional tests, or
when there is evidence of disease progression during serial evaluations. [233] Exercise recommendations should be individually tailored
based on the intensity of the exercise and the sporting discipline.
Participation in competitive endurance, power, and mixed disciplines
(see sections 4.2 and 5.1.3) generally requires vigorous effort and is
more likely to induce myocardial ischaemia, whereas leisure sports or
intentional recreational exercise allows for greater control of physical
effort. Individuals with a high risk of atherosclerotic CAD and asymptomatic individuals in whom CAD is detected at screening who participate in intensive exercise should be assessed with a maximal exercise
test or functional imaging test on an annual basis.

40 ESC Guidelines


(see Figure 2, section 4.1.2) for older patients (>60 years old) with CCS.
This is due to the fact that age is an additional, strong predictor of
adverse events during exercise. There are no restrictions in low-risk
patients for skills sports regardless of age (Figure 2).
Individuals with inducible ischaemia during functional testing,
despite adequate treatment, should undergo coronary angiography;
those with high-risk lesions on coronary angiography (Table 11)
should have revascularization prior to considering high-intensity
exercise programmes or competitive sport (Figure 5). Individuals with
high-risk coronary features may gradually return to sport 3�6
months after successful revascularization pending a normal maximal
exercise or functional imaging test.
When ischaemia cannot be treated despite adequate therapy,
including revascularization, the individual should be restricted from
competitive sports, with the possible exception of individually recommended low-intensity skill sports. Such individuals may engage in
regular recreational exercise of low and moderate intensity provided
risk factors and symptoms are treated adequately and there is regular
clinical surveillance. These individuals may also participate in leisure

�
sports, 2 3 times/week, in selected cases, if the intended activity is
below (around 10 beats) the ischaemic threshold and below the level
of arrhythmias. [231]

5.1.2.1 Antithrombotic treatment

Individuals with CAD should receive conventional antithrombotic

treatment for secondary prevention, according to published guidelines for the general population. [233,239,240] Individuals taking dual antiplatelet agents should avoid sports with bodily collision, especially
when they are combined with oral anticoagulants, due to the risk of

5.1.2 Established (long-standing) chronic coronary

All individuals with established (long-standing) CCS should be
encouraged to perform the minimal PA recommendations for general and CV health. [235] This applies to individuals with stable angina,
asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals stabilized <1 year after
ACS, or individuals with recent revascularization, and asymptomatic
and symptomatic individuals >1 year after initial diagnosis or revascularization. [110] Advice on intensive exercise and participation in most
competitive sports in asymptomatic individuals with long-standing

CCS should be based on several factors, which are determined

through clinical history, exercise stress testing, or functional imaging
and echocardiography (Table 10).
Individuals with long-standing CCS who do not show any abnormalities on a maximal exercise test or functional imaging test, or have
unimpaired LV function, may be considered as low risk for an exerciseinduced adverse event [236][�][238] (Table 11). Such individuals may engage
in all competitive sports on an individual basis (Figure 5). Some restrictions may apply for high-intensity power, mixed, and endurance sports

5.1.3 Myocardial ischaemia without obstructive disease in
the epicardial coronary artery
Ischaemia and non-obstructive CAD (INOCA) is an underrecognized entity associated with increased risk of adverse events [242]

that is usually detected during evaluation of anginal symptoms. Stress
CMR and PET can detect abnormal coronary flow reserve and suggest coronary microvascular dysfunction with non-critical lesions.
There are no established treatments for microvascular angina.
However, the panel suggests adhering to the same exercise recommendations as for long-standing CCS.

5.1.4 Return to sport after acute coronary syndrome
Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exCR) reduces cardiac
mortality, hospital readmission, [234234] and anxiety. [243] Individuals
who have experienced an ACS, cardiac surgery, or percutaneous
intervention should be referred to an early exCR programme, [235,242] soon after the discharge, [6,235,244] for 8�12 weeks
after the cardiac event. [235,244] Every week that exercise is delayed
requires an additional month of exercise to accomplish the same
level of benefit. [245]

Exercising individuals with CAD may start performing low- to
moderate-intensity recreational sporting activities in parallel with
participation in the structured progressive exercise programmes. All
types of sports activities may be considered, at an appropriate intensity level; however, careful attention should be paid to the development of new symptoms. [218]

In general, structured outpatient exercise programmes, for 3�6
months, are required to achieve the appropriate level of activity for
sports participation in patients with CAD. In individuals with non-ST
segment elevation MI or CCS who have had complete revascularization
and do not have residual ischaemia, exercise training can be progressed
at a faster pace until the recommended exercise level is reached.

5.1.4.1 Competitive athletes
Careful individual evaluation is required before starting high-intensity
competitive sports. In competitive athletes, an echocardiogram, maximal exercise test with 12-lead ECG recording or CPET is recommended for risk stratification before return to sports (see section
5.1.2). CPET specifically adds information on aerobic and anaerobic
thresholds, guiding exercise intensity prescription and progression
(see section 4.2).

5.1.4.2 Recreational athletes

For individuals intending to participate in non-competitive, recreational sports and leisure-time activity, similar principles apply
regarding risk stratification. A symptom-limited/maximal exercise
test should precede the return to sports. Higher-risk patients with
CCS (Table 11) are not eligible for competitive sports (see section
5.1.2); however, low-intensity skill sports, such as golf, may be
considered, at intensities below the angina threshold. If aerobic
exercise is not tolerated, predominantly strength-related sports

with a small amount of muscular work are recommended

(Figure 2, section 4.1.2).

5.1.5 Anomalous origin of coronary arteries
5.1.5.1 Background
The prevalence of AOCA (left and right coronary artery) is 0.44% in
the general population of adolescents. [246] AOCA is considered to be
a common cause of SCD in young athletes [17,18,247,248] but is rarely
implicated in individuals >40 years of age. [249,250]

Chest pain, exertional syncope and SCD may be the first manifestation of AOCA, [251] however, over two thirds of patients are
asymptomatic. [252] Mechanisms leading to SCD likely include
repeated bursts of ischaemia with consequent increase in myocardial fibrosis and a proclivity to develop VAs during exercise.
Ischaemia may result from the compression of the anomalous vessel coursing between the aorta and the pulmonary artery and/or
from the acute angled take-off from the aorta and/or the proximal
intramural course of the anomalous vessel (Figure 6). [253] Both left
and right anomalous coronary origins have been implicated in ExR SCD, although the risk has traditionally been thought to be considerably higher with an anomalous left coronary artery origin. [252]

Exercise testing rarely reveals myocardial ischaemia and multislice contrast-enhanced CT, CCTA, or CMR are the mainstay of
diagnosis.

5.1.5.2 Eligibility for sports
Eligibility for competitive sports is based on the anatomical
type of AOCA and on the presence of ischaemia. A highly positive inotropic and positive chronotropic exercise stress test is
the best approach to demonstrate or rule out ischaemia. AOCA
with acute angled take-off from the aorta resulting in a slit-like
orifice with reduced lumen and anomalous coursing between the
aorta and the pulmonary artery is associated with the greatest
risk for SCA/SCD whether or not the anomalous artery originates from the left or right sinus of Valsalva, and strong consideration should be given to surgical correction of such an anomaly

5.1.6 Myocardial bridging
5.1.6.1 Background
Myocardial bridging (MB) refers to a condition when some of the
myocardium overlies a segment of an epicardial coronary artery
(referred to as a tunnelled artery) and most commonly affects the
left anterior descending artery (Figure 7). The prevalence of MB varies
from 0.5�12% and up to 5�75% according to diagnostic angiography or CT scan series. [254] MBs are traditionally considered as benign;
however, the association between myocardial ischaemia and MBs
has increased their clinical relevance. MB may be discovered at
imaging after an abnormal exercise ECG and should also be suspected in individuals who present with exertional angina or syncope.
Coronary artery compression together with a Venturi (suction)
effect are the potential underlying mechanisms for exercise-induced
ischaemia. [248]

Evaluation of individuals with MB aims primarily at assessing the
morphologic characteristics of the anatomical anomaly (i.e. number
of MB, depth and overall length of the tunnelled vessel) and the presence of inducible ischaemia. A positive inotropic and positive chronotropic stress test is the best approach to demonstrate myocardial
ischaemia. MB without other underlying associated diseases [e.g.
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)] and with no evidence of inducible myocardial ischaemia has a good prognosis. [255] However, in
adult/senior individuals, it has been shown that the arterial compression in MB may be directly related to the atherosclerotic burden,
proximal to the MB. [256] These individuals should be considered in the
same category as individuals with CAD and treated appropriately if
necessary, although the vast majority of MB is clinically silent. Betablockers should be used when patients are symptomatic or myocardial ischaemia is established. Surgical repair may be considered, while

5.2 Exercise recommendations in

individuals with chronic heart failure

5.2.1 Background: rationale for exercise in chronic heart

failure

Most of the evidence regarding exercise in chronic heart failure (HF)
is derived from studies implementing exercise training programmes
that are considered safe and highly recommended in stable patients
on optimal medical therapy. [257][�][260] Meta-analyses of these studies
have demonstrated a significant improvement in exercise tolerance
and quality of life and a modest effect on all-cause and HF-specific
mortality and hospitalization. [261][�][267]

5.2.2 Risk stratification and preliminary evaluation
Exercise intervention should only be initiated in a clinically stable individual after medical therapy for HF has been optimized. Key components before commencing an exercise programme and sports
participation include:

(1) Exclusion of contraindications to exercise: Contraindications to initiating

an exercise programme in chronic HF include hypotension or

hypertension at rest or during exercise, unstable cardiac disease,

deteriorating symptoms of HF, myocardial ischaemia despite ther
apy (exercise may be permitted up to ischaemic threshold), or
severe and suboptimally treated pulmonary disease. [258]

(2) Performing a baseline assessment: A thorough cardiological evaluation

is required, including assessment of comorbidities and HF severity

(e.g. by assessment of blood natriuretic peptides and echocardiogra
phy). A maximal exercise test (preferably CPET) is important to

assess functional capacity, exercise-induced arrhythmias or haemo
dynamic abnormalities and for prescription of exercise intensity,
based on VO 2peak, or on resting and maximal heart rate during exercise [e.g. HRR or Borg’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE)]. [265,266]

(3) Optimizing medical therapy: All individuals with HF should be treated
according to current Guidelines, [257] including device implantation
when required. [267]

ESC Guidelines 45


The exercise session should be individually tailored for several
weeks, according to symptoms and objective findings during exercise
testing such as maximal exercise capacity, heart rate response, or
arrhythmias. In atrial fibrillation (AF), exercise can only be monitored
by power or Borg’s RPE.
High-risk patients should be counselled more frequently during the
initial phases. Ideally exercise should be supervised through an exercisebased cardiac rehabilitation programme while non-supervised homebased sessions should be gradually added. [260] When all these measures
are followed, the overall risk of exercise is low, even during higherintensity exercises and in patients with more severe HF. [268,269]

Follow-up examinations for exercise recommendations should be
scheduled at least every 3�6 months. Intervals between examinations
should depend on disease severity and comorbidities, setting of the
sessions (supervised vs. home-based), patient’s age and adherence.

5.2.3 Exercise modalities and sports participation in heart

failure

Following risk factor control and therapy optimization, the individual
with HF should be encouraged to start exercise programmes without
delay. [242,244,270] Initially home-based exercise programmes may also
be prescribed and monitored. [270,271]

In uncomplicated cases low to moderate-intensity recreational
sporting activities may be considered in parallel to the structured
exercise programme. When prescribed, maximal exercise intensities
should be monitored, for example, by heart rate monitors. If monitoring does not reveal any exercise-induced arrhythmias or other
abnormalities, then all types of recreational sports activities are permitted (see Figure 2, section 4.1.2).

5.2.3.1 Aerobic/endurance exercise

Aerobic exercise is recommended for stable patients [New York

�
Heart Association (NYHA) class I III], because of its welldemonstrated efficacy and safety. [260] Recommendations on optimal
exercise dose have been previously described in ESC and AHA
Guidelines. [242,270][�][272] The most commonly evaluated exercise mode
is moderate continuous exercise (MCE). [242,270][�][272] In patients in
NYHA functional class III, exercise intensity should be maintained at a
lower intensity (<40% of VO 2peak ), according to perceived symptoms
and clinical status during the first 1�2 weeks. This should be followed
by a gradual increase in intensity to 50�70% VO 2peak, and if tolerated, up to 85% VO 2peak as the primary aim. [270,271]

Recently, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) programmes have
been considered as an alternative exercise modality for low-risk
patients. [269] The most recent meta-analysis showed that HIIT was superior to MCE in improving VO 2peak in individuals with HF with reduced
(<40%) ejection fraction (HFrEF) in the short term. [273] However, this
superiority disappeared in subgroup analysis of isocaloric
protocols. HITT programmes may be recommended initially to prepare
low risk patients with stable HF who want to return to high intensity
aerobic and mixed endurance sports (Figure 2, section 4.1.2).

5.2.3.2 Resistance exercise

Resistance exercise training may complement, but not substitute,
aerobic exercise training because it reverses skeletal muscle mass
loss and deconditioning without excessive stress on the heart. [270,274]

The training intensity can preferably be set at the level of resistance


. [.................................................................................]


Table 12 Optimal exercise training dose for patients
with chronic heart failure

�
at which the patient can perform 10 15 repetitions at 15 on Borg’s
RPE scale (Table 12). [242,270] In patients with altered skeletal muscle
function and muscle wasting, exercise training should focus initially
on increasing muscle mass by using resistance programmes. [275,276]

Resistance programmes may specifically be considered for lowrisk stable patients, who want to return to strength-related power
sports, e.g. weightlifting (Figure 2, section 4.1.2). A meta-analysis
showed that resistance exercise as a single intervention has the
capacity to increase muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and quality of
life in HFrEF patients who are unable to participate in aerobic exercise programmes. [277] Also, in advanced HF or in patients with very
low exercise tolerance, resistance exercise can be safely applied if
small muscle groups are trained. [270,277,278]

5.2.3.3 Respiratory exercise
Inspiratory muscle training improves VO 2peak, dyspnoea, and muscle
strength, [279][�][282] and it typically involves several sessions per week
with intensity ranging from 30% to 60% of maximal inspiratory pressure, and duration from 15�30 min for an average of 10�12
weeks. [279] This training modality should be recommended to the
most severely deconditioned individuals as an initial alternative who
may then transition to conventional exercise training and sports participation, to optimize cardiopulmonary benefits. [280]

5.2.3.4 Aquatic exercise
Aquatic exercise has not been recommended for individuals

with HF, due to concerns that the increase in central blood

46 ESC Guidelines


volume and cardiac preload as a consequence of hydrostatic
pressure may not be tolerated. [283] However, a recent meta-analysis
has shown that aquatic exercise training may be safe and clinically
effective. [284]

5.2.4 Sports participation and return to sports
In addition to risk stratification (section 5.2.3), the evaluation for participation in sports includes intensity and type of sports (competitive
vs. recreational), and determining the individual fitness level.

5.2.4.1 Competitive sports
Participation in competitive sports may be considered in a group
of selected low-risk individuals. A thorough individual evaluation
using a maximal exercise test (or preferably CPET) is recommended before returning to sports, particularly before starting
moderate- to high-intensity sports, mixed and power sports
(Figure 2, section 4.1.2).
Asymptomatic individuals with preserved (>_50%) EF (HFpEF) or

�
with mid-range (>_40 59%) EF (HFmrEF) who are optimally treated
may be eligible to participate in some competitive sports in the
absence of exercise-induced arrhythmias or exercise-induced hypotension. In such cases, a progressive increase in exercise dose is recommended. The duration of this process is dependent upon the
functional capacity and perceived symptoms. Some restrictions may
apply to high-intensity endurance, mixed and power sports with high

demands, especially in older patients. No restrictions should apply
for skill-related sports.
Asymptomatic patients with HFrEF who are optimally treated
may only be considered safe to perform specific low-intensity skill
sports at a competitive level (Figure 2). Higher-risk patients including those who are suboptimally treated, those that remain in
NYHA II or III despite optimal therapy, and those with exerciseinduced arrhythmias or exercise-induced hypotension should not
participate in competitive sports, particularly those sports with
moderate to high cardiopulmonary strain during training or

competition.

5.2.4.2 Recreational sports
For patients intending to participate in recreational sports and
leisure-time activity, similar principles apply regarding risk stratification. A progressive increase in exercise dose is recommended. Lowto moderate-intensity skill, power, mixed, and endurance sports may
be considered in all asymptomatic individuals.
As with competitive sports, high-intensity recreational sports
should only be considered in asymptomatic individuals with HFmrEF

�
(EF 40 49%) who do not have exercise-induced arrhythmias or
exercise-induced hypotension. Asymptomatic individuals with HFrEF
who are optimally treated may engage in low- to moderate-intensity
skill-related recreational sports, and selectively in low-intensity
endurance sports (Figure 2).
In patients with HFrEF with very low exercise tolerance, frequent
decompensation, or patients with LV assist devices (see
Supplementary Data), participation in low-intensity skill-related sports
is possible, if tolerated. Regular low-intensity endurance activities, e.g.
walking or cycling, should generally be recommended to improve
basic exercise capacity.

5.2.6 Exercise in individuals after heart transplantation
The exercise capacity in heart transplantation (HTx) recipients is

�
reduced by 50 60% compared with healthy age and sex-matched
individuals in the general population, [300][�][302] due to several factors
(Table 13). [303] Exercise reduces CV risk induced by posttransplantation immunosuppressive medical therapy, [304] and
increases physical performance, [305] enabling HTx patients to achieve
levels comparable to age-matched controls. [306] HTx recipients participating in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes reveal a
favourable outcome with respect to hospital readmission and longterm survival. [305,307,308]

Improvements in exercise capacity are primarily dependent on the
volume of exercise. Increased functional capacity is primarily due to
peripheral adaptations in the skeletal muscle including increased oxidative capacity and capillary conductance. Cardiac allograft neural
reinnervation also contributes to improved functional capacity in the
first year. [304,309,310] If these occur, training can be performed at high
levels, enabling selected HTx patients to perform marathon runs or
triathlons. [304,309,310]

5.2.6.1 Exercise modalities and sports participation

A combination of endurance and resistance exercise is considered

to be the preferred exercise programme. Mean endurance
exercise intensity should start at a moderate intensity (60% VO 2peak ),
which can later be increased to 80% of VO 2peak, a regimen level
applied in the majority of exercise intervention studies in HTx. [305] In
uncomplicated cases these intensities can be increased to maximum

levels.

It is recommended that individuals should perform up to five
bouts of 30 min of exercise per week; however, exercise duration
and frequency have ranged from 30 min to 90 min for 2 to 5 times
per week, in previous HTx studies. [305,311] Both endurance and resistance training is included in these training sessions; however, an additional 2�3 sessions of resistance training may be performed

each week.

Resistance exercise should focus on large muscle groups using
own body weight exercises or exercises on weight machines. Upper
body resistance exercise should start at least 3 months after surgery,
and intensity should gradually increase from low to moderate but can

b Level of evidence.

5.2.5 Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes are a cornerstone
in the holistic prevention and management of HFpEF. [260,285] Exercise
intervention for 12�24 weeks increases functional capacity and quality of life. [286][�][292] The beneficial effects seem to be mediated by
improvement in oxidative muscle metabolism and vascular function. [293] In obese patients, weight reduction has been shown to have
similar effects to exercise alone, [288] therefore a stable weight reduction of 10% over 2�4 years is recommended. [294]

5.2.5.1 Exercise modalities and sports participation
Higher endurance intensities such as HIIT (4 � 4 min at 85�90%
peak heart rate, with 3 min active recovery) have revealed positive
effects on myocardial function, but data are limited to a small group
of patients with diabetes. [295] HIIT performed over 4 weeks significantly improved VO 2peak and LV diastolic function. [296] Higherintensity exercise should be limited to stable patients and could be
gradually introduced after 4 weeks of MCE.
Exercise sessions should start with short phases of 10 min of
endurance and 10 min of resistance exercises, which should gradually
be extended in time over a period of 4 weeks. The final aim should
be at least 30�45 min for >_3 days per week. Depending on the
patient’s symptomatic status and functional capacity, intervals of
higher intensity may be introduced.
Duration of intervention seems to be important for inducing functional and structural CV changes in HFpEF. Interventions over 2 years
in healthy individuals reversed early signs of diastolic dysfunction. [297,298] Regarding sports participation refer to section 5.2.3.

also be performed up to submaximal intensities, in case of uncomplicated disease (see section 4.1.1).
A major limitation of endurance exercise is the reduced chronotropic response to exercise because of allograft denervation. Apart
from chronotropic incompetence, other pathophysiological changes
present after HTx should also be considered when prescribing and
conducting an exercise programme (Table 13). Exercise-induced
ischaemia from cardiac allograft vasculopathy should be considered,
particularly when performing higher-intensity exercise, which has
been advocated to have some superior effects on improving exercise
capacity in these patients. [311,312]

Feasibility and safety of sports participation in stable asymptomatic
HTx patients, after therapy optimization, has been reported.
Therefore, participation in competitive sports, avoiding high-intensity

individuals.

5.3 Exercise recommendations

in individuals with valvular heart

disease

5.3.1 Introduction

�
Valvular heart disease affects approximately 1 2% of young exercising individuals in the general population. Reports on the natural
history of valvular heart disease in athletes are sparse; however,
there is a theoretical possibility that a large stroke volume, coupled
with vigorous mechanical contractions of the heart, and an
increased chronotropic state induced by exercise may accelerate
valve dysfunction. The ensuing effects on chronic stenotic or
regurgitant lesions may cause compensatory cardiac hypertrophy,
impaired ventricular function, myocardial ischaemia, cardiac
arrhythmias, and possibly SCD. . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


5.3.1.1 General principles in assessment and risk stratification of individuals with valvular heart disease prior to leisure exercise or competitive

sports
There are no prospective studies examining the impact of exercise
on the progression of valvular disease; therefore, general guidance
presented in this section is based on consensus opinions and longterm follow-up studies from non-athletic populations. Most individuals with valvular heart disease are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and some may aspire to engage in regular exercise
programmes including leisure and competitive sports. The management of these individuals requires assessment of the symptomatic
status, functional capacity, the nature of the valvular lesion, and
impact of the resulting loading conditions on cardiac structure and
function. All individuals should be assessed with a clinical history,
physical examination, ECG, echocardiography, and exercise stress
test. The clinical history should enquire about cardiac symptoms and
functional capacity. Echocardiography should focus on the valve morphology and function with particular attention to the severity and the
impact of cardiac chamber size and function. Exercise testing should
resemble the intensity of the sport being engaged in and should focus
on inducibility of symptoms, arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia, and
the haemodynamic (BP) response to exercise. Some individuals may
require exercise echocardiography to assess the severity of the valve

defect.

Asymptomatic individuals with mild to moderate valvular dysfunction who have preserved ventricular function and show good functional capacity without exercise-inducible myocardial ischaemia,
abnormal haemodynamic response, or arrhythmias are considered
to be at low risk and may participate in all sports. Indeed, mild valvular
regurgitation (mostly tricuspid and pulmonary) are common among
trained athletes and likely represent a feature of the athlete’s heart.
Conversely, individuals with exertional symptoms, moderate or
severe valvular dysfunction, left or right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmias or
abnormal haemodynamic response are considered to be at high risk

and should be considered for invasive intervention.

5.3.1.2 Surveillance

All individuals with valvular heart disease should be assessed on a regular basis. The frequency of the assessment may vary from 6 monthly
to 2 yearly depending on symptomatic status and the severity of valve
dysfunction.

5.3.2 Aortic valve stenosis

Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is most frequently the result of an agedependent degenerative process causing progressive thickening, calcification, and reduced mobility of the cusps. [313] AS causes an increase
in transvalvular pressure gradient and LV workload, with consequent
LV hypertrophy, fibrosis, and increased myocardial oxygen demand.
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is usually preserved. Affected
individuals may have a normal cardiac output at rest and even during
exercise, therefore, some individuals with AS are capable of good
exercise performance. Nonetheless, severe AS is associated with

increased risk of heart failure and SCD from mechanical outflow
obstruction, malignant VAs, or coronary hypoperfusion. [18,314]

The diagnosis and grading of AS during echocardiography is based
on well-established criteria. [315] Specifically, severe AS is defined by: (i)

sports involving low and moderate intensity and may be considered

for more intensive exercise on an individual basis. Such individuals

require more frequent surveillance on a 6-monthly basis to assess LV
function. In asymptomatic individuals with severe AR and reduced
LVEF, surgical valve replacement/repair is indicated, and they should
not participate in competitive sports but may participate in leisure
sports involving only low-intensity exercise. Surgery is recommended
in symptomatic individuals with severe AR. These individuals should
not participate in competitive or leisure sports; however, lowintensity aerobic exercise activity is encouraged to improve functional capacity and general well-being.

5.3.4 Bicuspid aortic valve
Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital abnormality with

�
a prevalence of 1 2% in the general population. [320] BAV may be
associated with AS or AR and increased risk for ascending aortic
aneurysm or dissection, and SCD. [28,321] Compared with Marfan . [.....................................................]


syndrome, the risk of aortopathy is lower; nonetheless BAV is much
more frequent, and the relative risk of aortic dissection has been
reported to be eight times greater than with a tricuspid aortic
valve. [321] BAV may not be identified during physical examination in
the absence of valve dysfunction; [58,322] however, the outcome of
young individuals without valvular dysfunction is good. [323,324]

It is unclear whether intensive exercise accelerates aortic dilatation

in the long term. A previous study comparing athletes with BAV,

non-athletes with BAV, and athletes with a normal aortic valve

reported that athletes with BAV showed a 0.11 ± 0.59 mm/year

increase in aortic size at the sinuses of Valsalva and 0.21 ± 0.44 mm/

year for the proximal ascending aorta, which was not dissimilar to
non-athletes with a BAV. [325] Currently, expert consensus panels
advise a cautious approach to sports activities when the ascending
aorta is above the normal limits (see section 5.4). In the absence of
aortopathy, exercise recommendations for individuals with BAV are
identical to those in individuals with tricuspid aortic valve
dysfunction.

5.3.5 Primary mitral regurgitation
Most individuals with mitral valve disease have primary mitral regurgitation (MR) from myxomatous disease. [326] MR is confirmed and quantified by echocardiography. General recommendations regarding
exercise and sports are based on symptomatic status, severity of MR,
LV function, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), and the presence or absence of arrhythmias during exercise. Both athletic training
and MR may be associated with an enlarged LV cavity; however, an
enlarged LV that is disproportionate to the level of exercise may be
suggestive of severe MR and an indication to refrain from competitive
or leisure sports involving moderate- or high-intensity exercise. . [................................]


Asymptomatic individuals with mild or moderate MR may compete in all sports if they have good functional capacity, preserved LV
function, sPAP < 50 mmHg and absence of complex arrhythmias during exercise. Individuals with symptomatic MR and reduced exercise
capacity or individuals with MR with exercise-induced complex
arrhythmias should not participate in competitive or leisure sport;
however, low-intensity aerobic exercise should be encouraged to
improve functional capacity and general well-being. Individuals on
long-term anticoagulation therapy for AF should not engage in contact/collision sport.

5.3.5.1 Mitral valve prolapse
Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is characterized by fibro-myxomatous
changes of the mitral valve leaflets and has a prevalence of
1�2.4%. [328,329] The diagnosis of MVP is defined as >2 mm displacement of one or both leaflets of the mitral valve beyond the annulus
within the left atrium in end-systole. [330] MVP is generally benign with
a 10-year mortality risk of 5%. [331] The majority of individuals are identified incidentally during cardiac auscultation, or echocardiography.
The most common complication of MVP is the progression to

�
chronic severe MR, in 5 10% of individuals with MVP. Other complications include HF from chronic MR, pulmonary hypertension, infective endocarditis, supraventricular and VAs, and, occasionally,
SCD. [313] In the Italian cardiac pathology registry of 650 SCDs in young
adults, 7% were attributed to MVP. [332] Most decedents showed scar
ring in the infero-basal wall and papillary muscles and bi-leaflet prolapse. Myocardial scarring, mitral valve annular disjunction (i.e. an
abnormal atrial displacement of the mitral valve leaflet hinge point
during systole), [333] T-wave inversion in the inferior leads and VAs arising from the LV [right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology]
were high-risk features for SCD. [334] The mechanical strain of MVP on
papillary muscles and adjacent myocardium is thought to be responsible for the myocardial scarring, which may be a possible mechanism
for life-threatening arrhythmias in some individuals. [335,336]

In general, exercising individuals with MVP have an excellent prognosis. In a recent Italian study of 7449 young competitive athletes,
MVP was identified in 2.9%. During a follow-up period of 8 ± 2 years
there were no fatalities. [337] Adverse events, including progressive MR

with LV dilatation, ischaemic stroke, and AF occurred at a rate of

0.5% per annum and were more common in older athletes with baseline mitral valve disjunction or VAs.

Individuals with MVP should be evaluated with an exercise test and
24-hour ECG. Individuals with inferior T-wave inversion or . [................................................................................................]


ventricular premature beats arising from the LV should undergo a
CMR imaging scan to check specifically for myocardial fibrosis affecting the infero-basal wall. Other potentially high-risk markers include
evidence of mechanical dispersion detected by speckled tracking
echocardiography, [338] coexisting prolongation of the QT interval and
mitral annular disjunction. [333]

Given the relatively benign nature of MVP, asymptomatic patients
with mild or moderate MR can participate in all competitive sports
and leisure sports in the absence of the aforementioned risk factors
(Figure 8). Asymptomatic patients with severe MR but none of the
above high-risk markers may compete in low- to moderate-intensity
sports after detailed discussion with their specialist in the presence of
LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) <60 mm (or <35.5 mm/m [2] in
men and <40 mm/m [2] in women) with LVEF >_ 60%, resting sPAP <
50 mmHg, and normal exercise test.
Symptomatic patients with MVP and any of the aforementioned
high-risk features (Figure 8) should not participate in recreational
or competitive sports; however, low-intensity aerobic exercise
should be encouraged to improve functional capacity and general
well-being.

5.3.6 Mitral stenosis

Although rheumatic valve disease is uncommon in the western
world, the increase in emigration patterns means that cardiologists
may encounter individuals with rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) who
aspire to exercise. Individuals with advanced MS are usually symptomatic and incapable of engaging in exercise regimens with a high CV
demand. The risk stratification of exercising individuals with MS is
based largely on a detailed echocardiogram with specific interest in
the severity of the lesion and accompanying systolic PAP. In addition,
assessment should include a maximal exercise stress test to identify
concealed symptoms and functional capacity.

ESC Guidelines 53


Asymptomatic individuals with mild MS [mitral valve area (MVA)
1.5�2.0 cm [2] ] and moderate MS (MVA 1.0�1.5 cm [2] ) who are in sinus
rhythm and demonstrate good functional capacity on exercise testing
and a normal sPAP may participate in all competitive and leisure
sports. Mildly symptomatic individuals with severe MS (MVA < 1.0
cm [2] ) may only participate in leisure exercise involving physical effort
of low intensity. Individuals with symptomatic MS should be referred
for intervention and advised to abstain from participation in sports
and recreational exercise of moderate or high intensity. Individuals
with AF should be anticoagulated and avoid contact/collision sport. In
cases of balloon mitral valvuloplasty with good results (i.e. MVA > 2.0
cm [2] ) regular exercise and competitive sport may be considered in
asymptomatic individuals with good functional capacity. . [.......................................]


Mild TR is common in athletes and accompanied by physiological
dilatation of the inferior vena cava, which is easily collapsible with
inspiration. Severe TR is characterized by increasing tricuspid annular
dilatation and RV remodelling that eventually leads to RV dysfunction
and a non-reactive inferior vena cava. Individuals with severe TR may
also have a reduced exercise capacity due to an impaired cardiac output response with exercise. [339] Furthermore, they may experience
increased right- and left-sided filling pressures during exercise, the latter being due to diastolic ventricular interaction. [340]

In general, asymptomatic patients with TR who have good functional capacity, non-dilated right ventricle, preserved ventricular function, sPAP<40 mmHg, and absence of complex arrhythmias may
compete in all competitive and recreational sports.

5.4 Exercise recommendations in
individuals with aortopathy

5.4.1 Introduction

Thoracic aortic aneurysms are largely asymptomatic until a sudden
and catastrophic event, including aortic rupture or dissection, occurs,

54 ESC Guidelines


which can be rapidly fatal. Advanced age, male sex, long-term history
of arterial hypertension, and the presence of aortic aneurysm confer
the greatest population attributable risk for aortic dissection.
However, patients with genetic connective tissue disorders such as
Marfan (MFS), Loeys Dietz, Turner, or Ehlers Danlos (EDS) syndromes, and patients with BAV are at increased risk at a much

�
younger age. BAV has a prevalence of about 1 2% in the general
population. These patients have a relatively low risk for aortic dissection in comparison with patients with hereditary thoracic aortic disease (HTAD). Having a family history of aortic dissection or sudden
death is a risk factor and a larger diameter of the aorta carries a higher
risk, although dissection can occur at any diameter and especially in
EDS patients there is no clear association with aortic
diameter. [341][�][343]

A dilated aortic root (>40 mm) is not a feature of athlete’s heart,
with only a small minority of young athletes (0.3%) having an enlarged
aortic root diameter. [344][�][347] During follow-up no progressive
enlargement of the aortic diameter was observed in these athletes,
and no aortic events occurred during a 5-year period. [347]

5.4.2 Risk of dissection

Because of the increase in BP and wall stress associated with intensive

exercise and sports, such activities are potentially associated with an
enhanced risk of expansion of the aorta and acute aortic dissection.
However, daily exercise is important in maintaining an ideal BP, heart
rate, and body weight and a sedentary lifestyle is an important modifiable risk factor for CV disease and mortality. Physical activity is
advised in all patients with aortic pathology, even when the aorta is

dilated.

There are no randomized controlled trials on competitive sports
in patients with thoracic aortic disease, or any prospective data
regarding the risks of competitive athletics in patients after surgical
correction; however, even after aortic root replacement, patients
with MFS and other HTAD remain at risk of aortic complications.

effects of a 3-week rehabilitation training programme in 19 MFS
patients with a mean age of 47 years. During the 1-year follow-up,
there were no adverse events but there was improvement in physical
fitness and reduction in psychological distress. These effects were
detectable after 3 weeks of rehabilitation, and mostly persisted
through the 1-year follow-up. Unfortunately, no information on
aortic diameters was provided. [348]

5.4.3 Sporting disciplines

Exercise-related acute thoracic aortic dissections are described in

the literature in a total of 49 case reports. Of these, 42 patients suffered Stanford type A thoracic aortic dissections. In the majority (26/
49) weightlifting was associated with aortic dissection. [349]

Furthermore, a recently published retrospective cohort study of 615
patients with acute type A aortic dissection found that 4.1% cases
were related to sports activities. The type of sports most often
reported was golf (32%), but this was not corrected for the percentage of participants in the sport and probably reflects that golfers are
frequently older with an increased risk of hypertension and hence
the potential for dissection. [350]

5.4.4 Effect on aortic diameter and wall stress

One cross-sectional study, which included 58 competitive athletes

with BAV, showed no correlation between aortic dimensions and
duration of training. [351] Two studies compared athletes and sedentary
individuals with BAV and reported no difference in aortic growth
rate between the two groups.
Two MFS mouse models investigating the effects of mildmoderate dynamic exercise on the aortic wall showed a reduction in
the growth rate of the aortic diameter in mice with MFS that performed mild to moderate dynamic exercise compared to sedentary
mice with MFS. [352,353] Among exercising mice, the aortic wall became
stronger and a larger mechanical stress was required to induce aortic
rupture. An optimum protective effect was found at a training intensity level of 55�65% of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2max ).


A dilated aortic root (>40 mm) is not a feature of athlete’s heart,
with only a small minority of young athletes (0.3%) having an enlarged
aortic root diameter. [344][�][347] During follow-up no progressive
enlargement of the aortic diameter was observed in these athletes,
and no aortic events occurred during a 5-year period. [347]


5.4.2 Risk of dissection

Because of the increase in BP and wall stress associated with intensive

exercise and sports, such activities are potentially associated with an
enhanced risk of expansion of the aorta and acute aortic dissection.
However, daily exercise is important in maintaining an ideal BP, heart
rate, and body weight and a sedentary lifestyle is an important modifiable risk factor for CV disease and mortality. Physical activity is
advised in all patients with aortic pathology, even when the aorta is

dilated.

There are no randomized controlled trials on competitive sports
in patients with thoracic aortic disease, or any prospective data
regarding the risks of competitive athletics in patients after surgical
correction; however, even after aortic root replacement, patients
with MFS and other HTAD remain at risk of aortic complications.
One small prospective cohort study evaluated the feasibility and

5.4.5 Recommendations

Regular exercise has a well-documented benefit for fitness, psychological well-being, and social interaction, as well as a positive effect on
hypertension and concomitant future risk of dissection. Most individuals with aortic pathology benefit from a certain minimal exercise
programme and can at least participate in recreational sports
(Table 14). Some lesions are not compatible with endurance training
and athletic sports, due to their high risk of dissection or rupture.
Recommendations for exercise and sports should be individualized
and based on the underlying diagnosis, the aortic diameter, family history for dissection or sudden death (risk factor), and the pre-existing
fitness and experience. An exercise test with an assessment of blood
pressure response is recommended before engaging in sports.

5.5 Exercise recommendations in
individuals with cardiomyopathies,
myocarditis, and pericarditis
Cardiomyopathies are an important cause of SCD/SCA in young individuals and exercise has been implicated as a trigger for fatal
arrhythmias. [17][�][19,28] The detection of a cardiomyopathy in an individual has important implications with respect to ongoing participation
in exercise. The advent of preventive strategies for SCD has led to a
significant expansion in the number of predominantly asymptomatic
young patients with cardiomyopathies who aspire to exercise. When
advising such individuals, it is essential to strike a balance between
protecting patients from the potentially adverse effects of exercise

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


5.5.1 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
The diagnosis of HCM is based on the presence of unexplained LV
hypertrophy, defined as a maximum end-diastolic wall thickness >_15
mm, in any myocardial segment on echocardiography, CMR, or CT
imaging. [355] HCM may also be considered in individuals with a lesser
degree of LV hypertrophy (wall thickness >_13 mm) in the context of
a family history of definite HCM or a positive genetic test. [355]

5.5.1.1 Risk stratification in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Circumstantial evidence and a large systematic collection of young
SCDs in sports in the US suggest that exercise increases the risk of
SCD/SCA in individuals with HCM. [18] Consistently, previous consen
sus recommendations have restricted all athletes with HCM from
competitive sports. [1,356,357]

More recently, relatively small longitudinal clinical studies indicate
that the risk of SCD during exercise may be considerably lower than
initially considered. Lampert et al. reported that individuals with
HCM who continued participating in sports after implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation did not reveal an increased
number of shocks during exercise. [358,359] In a cross-sectional study of
187 patients with HCM, vigorous exercise was not associated with
the occurrence of VAs. [358] Pelliccia et al. reported outcomes in a
cohort of 35 athletes with HCM, engaged in training and competitions for 5 to 31 years (mean 15 ± 8). During a 9-year follow-up
period, there were no differences in the incidence of symptoms or
major events between athletes who ceased exercise (n = 20) compared with athletes who continued competitive sports (n = 15). [360] In
a post-mortem series, only 23% of 194 deaths from HCM occurred
during sport, and affected males with a mean age of 30 years. [361]

Finally, individuals with HCM who participated in rehabilitation programmes demonstrated a significant improvement in functional
capacity without adverse events. [362,363]

In conclusion, there is limited evidence to indicate that all individu
als with HCM are vulnerable to fatal arrhythmias during exercise and
sport participation. In this regard, systematic restriction from competitive sports in all affected individuals is probably unjustified and a
more liberal approach to sports participation is reasonable in some
individuals after careful evaluation. [3] This is particularly important for
the majority of individuals with HCM who wish to participate in amateur sports or leisure-time exercise to maintain their physical and
psychological well-being.

5.5.1.2 Baseline assessment of patients with HCM
A systematic approach is required when assessing an individual with
HCM who requests exercise advice. The baseline evaluation should
include a comprehensive personal and family history with consideration of the age of the individual and years of exercise prior to diagnosis, assessment of the severity of the HCM phenotype, and the
presence of any conventional risk factors for SCD/SCA. In older
patients with HCM, the physician should review the presence of cardiac comorbidities such as hypertension and ischaemic heart disease,
which may confer a worse prognosis in HCM. [364,365]

5.5.1.3 History
The presence of symptoms attributed to HCM should prompt more
conservative exercise recommendations. Individuals with a history of
cardiac arrest or unheralded syncope and individuals with exercise

5.5 Exercise recommendations in
individuals with cardiomyopathies,
myocarditis, and pericarditis
Cardiomyopathies are an important cause of SCD/SCA in young individuals and exercise has been implicated as a trigger for fatal
arrhythmias. [17][�][19,28] The detection of a cardiomyopathy in an individual has important implications with respect to ongoing participation
in exercise. The advent of preventive strategies for SCD has led to a
significant expansion in the number of predominantly asymptomatic
young patients with cardiomyopathies who aspire to exercise. When
advising such individuals, it is essential to strike a balance between
protecting patients from the potentially adverse effects of exercise
and depriving them of the multiple benefits of exercise.

56 ESC Guidelines


induced symptoms should be advised to engage in low-intensity recreational sports only.

5.5.1.4 Resting and ambulatory ECG
The resting 12-lead ECG has limited value in risk stratification.
Ambulatory ECG monitoring, preferably for 48 h, is important for
detecting ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. The monitoring period should include an exercise session. Asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) confers considerable risk of
SCD in younger individuals (<_35 years). [355] Paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias may pose significant implications for functional
capacity and, in the case of AF, for stroke prevention. [366]

5.5.1.5 Echocardiography

In relation to risk stratification for SCD the clinician should assess the

following echocardiographic indices: (i) LV wall thickness; (ii) LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient; and (iii) left atrial diameter. [355] All individuals should have the LVOT gradient assessed at rest, during the
Valsalva manoeuvre, on standing suddenly, and after light exercise on
the spot, such as repeated squats. By convention, LVOT obstruction
is defined as a peak pressure gradient >_30 mmHg at rest or during
physiological provocation. A gradient >_50 mmHg is considered to be
haemodynamically important. Exercise stress echocardiography
should be considered in individuals with exertional symptoms who
have resting systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets but
who do not reveal LVOT obstruction or show only mild to moderate

LVOT obstruction with the aforementioned manoeuvres.

5.5.1.6 Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
CMR imaging is increasingly recognized as a necessary tool for confirming diagnosis and to assess risk stratification in individuals with
HCM. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), indicative of myocardial
fibrosis, may be present in up to 75% of patients with HCM and, by
itself, is a poor discriminator of outcomes. However, the presence of
extensive (>_15% of LV myocardium) LGE may identify individuals at
increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and SCD. [367][�][370]

5.5.1.7 Exercise testing
Exercise testing (or CPET) should be part of the routine evaluation
to assess functional capacity in an individual with HCM who intends
to exercise. In addition, an abnormal BP response to exercise
(defined as <20 mmHg increase in SBP from baseline, or exerciseinduced hypotension) [371,372] and the presence of exercise-induced
symptoms or arrhythmias are markers of high risk and should result

in more conservative exercise recommendations.

5.5.1.8 Genetic testing
Currently genetic testing is reserved for familial cascade screening. It
does not inform decisions relating to the risk of SCD/SCA and should
not be performed for exercise risk stratification.

5.5.1.9 ESC risk score in HCM

The ESC risk score uses seven variables (age, syncope, family
history of SCD from HCM, maximal LV wall thickness, left atrial . [...................................................................................................................................................................]


diameter, LV outflow obstruction, NSVT) to assess the risk
of SCD of patients with HCM. [355,373] This information can be
inserted into an online calculator (https://doc2do.com/hcm/
webHCM.html) to estimate individualized 5-year risk to provide
guidance on whether a prophylactic ICD is indicated. For
the purposes of these Guidelines the risk of SCD is defined as low
if <4%, moderate if between >_4% and <6%, and high if >_6% in
5 years.

On completion of the baseline evaluation, the physician should consider: (i) the presence of symptoms; (ii) ESC risk score; (iii) presence
of resting or inducible LVOT obstruction during exercise; (iv) the
haemodynamic (BP) response to exercise; and (v) the presence of
resting or exercise-induced arrhythmias before recommending the
appropriate form and intensity of exercise.
Although these Guidelines advocate for a more liberal approach
to sports participation, it is indisputable that even the absence of
all major risk factors does not convey immunity to SCD. [374] In addition, the ESC risk score relies on evidence derived from predominantly non-athletic cohorts. [373] Whereas there are no data to
suggest that this approach to risk estimation is less valid in athletic
individuals, one has to consider that it may not accurately reflect
the risk of SCD in individuals exposed to the haemodynamic and
metabolic stresses of high-intensity sports. Therefore, when advising an individual with HCM regarding participation in high-intensity
exercise programmes and competitive sports, this consideration
should be an integral part of the discussion during the shared
decision-making process.

5.5.1.11 Special considerations
The age of an individual may have an impact on risk. The mean age
of death in the largest series of SCD from the US was 18 years,
with 65% of deaths occurring in athletes <_17 years. [354] Although
young age should not exclude an individual from high-intensity

exercise in the absence of additional risk factors, it should be con
sidered in the discussion with the individual and the parents or
guardians. In addition, specific sports may pose a higher risk for

�
SCD, such as highly dynamic, start stop sports like basketball and
football. [17,58]

Individuals who have a positive genotype but who do not reveal
any phenotypic structural or arrhythmia features of HCM may engage
in all sports. Such individuals should be assessed annually for phenotypic features and risk stratification purposes.

5.5.1.12 Follow-up
Annual follow-up is recommended for most individuals with HCM
who exercise on a regular basis. More frequent (6-monthly) followup should be considered in adolescent individuals and young adults
whose phenotype, and therefore risk of SCD, may still be evolving
and who are more vulnerable to exercise-related SCD. [58,239] Follow
up evaluation should focus on assessment of disease progression and
risk stratification. New symptoms should prompt interruption of

exercise and re-evaluation.


5.5.1.4 Resting and ambulatory ECG
The resting 12-lead ECG has limited value in risk stratification.
Ambulatory ECG monitoring, preferably for 48 h, is important for
detecting ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. The monitoring period should include an exercise session. Asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) confers considerable risk of
SCD in younger individuals (<_35 years). [355] Paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias may pose significant implications for functional
capacity and, in the case of AF, for stroke prevention. [366]


5.5.1.5 Echocardiography

In relation to risk stratification for SCD the clinician should assess the

following echocardiographic indices: (i) LV wall thickness; (ii) LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient; and (iii) left atrial diameter. [355] All individuals should have the LVOT gradient assessed at rest, during the
Valsalva manoeuvre, on standing suddenly, and after light exercise on
the spot, such as repeated squats. By convention, LVOT obstruction
is defined as a peak pressure gradient >_30 mmHg at rest or during
physiological provocation. A gradient >_50 mmHg is considered to be
haemodynamically important. Exercise stress echocardiography
should be considered in individuals with exertional symptoms who
have resting systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets but
who do not reveal LVOT obstruction or show only mild to moderate

LVOT obstruction with the aforementioned manoeuvres.


5.5.1.6 Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
CMR imaging is increasingly recognized as a necessary tool for confirming diagnosis and to assess risk stratification in individuals with
HCM. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), indicative of myocardial
fibrosis, may be present in up to 75% of patients with HCM and, by
itself, is a poor discriminator of outcomes. However, the presence of
extensive (>_15% of LV myocardium) LGE may identify individuals at
increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and SCD. [367][�][370]


5.5.1.7 Exercise testing
Exercise testing (or CPET) should be part of the routine evaluation
to assess functional capacity in an individual with HCM who intends
to exercise. In addition, an abnormal BP response to exercise
(defined as <20 mmHg increase in SBP from baseline, or exerciseinduced hypotension) [371,372] and the presence of exercise-induced
symptoms or arrhythmias are markers of high risk and should result

in more conservative exercise recommendations.


5.5.1.8 Genetic testing
Currently genetic testing is reserved for familial cascade screening. It
does not inform decisions relating to the risk of SCD/SCA and should
not be performed for exercise risk stratification.


5.5.1.9 ESC risk score in HCM

The ESC risk score uses seven variables (age, syncope, family
history of SCD from HCM, maximal LV wall thickness, left atrial

ESC Guidelines 57


be agreed, it can be considered as an umbrella term for a family of diseases that are characterized by biventricular myocardial abnormalities, including fibro-fatty infiltration and scarring, identified by
pathological examination and/or cardiac imaging and VA.
The term arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is used
throughout these recommendations; however, it is important to recognize that most of the literature on the influence of exercise on disease progression and risk of SCD is derived from cohorts with
classical ARVC. This is reflected in the recommendations provided in
these Guidelines. It is possible therefore that the recommendations
may not accurately reflect predominantly LV disease, which constitutes a small proportion of the disease spectrum where the impact of
exercise on disease phenotype and risk is less clarified than the RV
variant. Where appropriate, guidance is provided for other conditions that can be reasonably considered under the umbrella of ACM

[including subtypes of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)].

5.5.2.1 Risk stratification in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
ACM accounts for a significant proportion of SCDs in young and athletic individuals. [28] Established risk factors for SCD that should

prompt consideration for an ICD include aborted SCD, unheralded
syncope, ventricular tachycardia, and impaired RV and/or LV systolic
function. [379] A novel risk prediction model for VAs has recently been
proposed but is yet to be validated. [380] Regular and high-intensity
exercise programmes are associated with acceleration of the disease
process and worse outcomes. [381][�][389]

In an experimental model of heterozygous plakoglobin-deficient
mice, exercise training accelerated RV dysfunction and arrhythmias. [382] Similar results have been confirmed in human desmosomal

mutation carriers participating in vigorous (>70% VO 2max ) endurance
sports. [384] Similar findings were reported in patients with ACM and
asymptomatic gene-positive family members, despite a more conservative definition of athletic status (exercise with intensity >_6 METs
for >_4 h/week for >_6 years). [386] Recently, the results from the North
American multidisciplinary study reported that patients engaging in
competitive sports were at two-fold increased risk of ventricular
tachyarrhythmias or death and earlier presentation of symptoms,
compared with patients who participated in recreational sports and
sedentary individuals. [385] Among patients engaging in competitive
sports, early age of sports initiation was associated with premature
presentation of symptoms and adverse clinical profile. Reducing exercise intensity was associated with a substantial decrease in the risk of
ventricular tachyarrhythmias or death, to the same level as inactive
patients. [385] Finally, in a multinational registry of 393 competitive athletes implanted with an ICD who continued to participate in regular
competitions, 20% of athletes with ACM received a shock during
exertion compared to 10% at rest, during a median follow-up of 44
months. The diagnosis of ACM was the only variable associated with
receiving appropriate shocks during competition. [359,389]

5.5.2.2 Baseline assessment of patients with arrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy
A systematic approach is required when assessing individuals with
ACM who request exercise advice. The baseline evaluation should
include a comprehensive history of symptoms and family history of
ACM or SCD, assessment of the severity of the ACM phenotype,
and the presence of any conventional risk factors for SCD/SCA.

5.5.2 Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is defined
pathologically by the presence of fibro-fatty replacement of the right
ventricle and clinically by life-threatening VAs. The condition was initially recognized as a predominantly RV disease, and diagnosis is currently based on probabilistic Task Force Criteria that encompass
electrophysiological, anatomical, functional, and clinical features of
the disease. [375] Since its first description, the concept of ARVC has
evolved to include concealed or subclinical phenotypes and biventric
ular disease. It is now well established that both ventricles are
affected in most cases. [376][�][378] This has led to the development of a
new term, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, that embraces an array
of diagnostic terms for different (genetic and acquired) pathologies.
Although the definition of ‘arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy’ is yet to

58 ESC Guidelines


5.5.2.3 History
Syncope due to presumed arrhythmia is an important risk marker
for SCD/SCA and a predictor of future appropriate ICD
therapies. [390][�][394] The presence of symptoms attributed to ACM

should reinforce the conservative exercise recommendations.

Individuals with a history of cardiac arrest or unheralded syncope
and individuals with exercise-induced symptoms should be
advised to engage only in low-intensity recreational exercise

programmes.

5.5.2.4 Resting and ambulatory ECG
Apart from its diagnostic utility, the 12-lead ECG may provide useful
information relating to risk stratification in ACM. The presence of extensive T-wave inversion affecting >_3 precordial leads or T-wave inversion

in two of the three inferior leads confers some additional risk for SCD/
SCA. [395,396]

Ambulatory ECG monitoring is important for detecting VAs.
Every effort should be made for the monitoring period to
include the proposed exercise session. The presence of NSVT or
significant burden of ventricular ectopy (>_1000/24 h), even in
asymptomatic individuals, confers an increased risk of fatal . [...............................................................]
arrhythmias. [392,393,397]

5.5.2.5 Echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

In relation to risk stratification for SCD, the clinician should

assess the severity of RV and LV involvement in terms of ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction. CMR imaging is more useful than echocardiography for assessing RV wall motion
abnormalities and can also quantify the degree of myocardial fat

infiltration and/or scar. The more extensive the disease the
higher the arrhythmic risk. [398,399]

5.5.2.6 Exercise testing
Exercise testing should be part of the routine assessment of every
individual with ACM who wishes to exercise, as it can provide information regarding functional capacity and risk stratification. Exercise
testing in patients with ACM should not be performed during ‘hot
phases’. The presence of exercise-induced symptoms or arrhythmias

should result in more conservative recommendations.

5.5.2.7 Genetic testing
Genotype may also be of prognostic value. In the ARVC variant, a
number of studies have reported that carriers of multiple pathogenic
variants in the same desmosomal gene or mutations in >_2 genes may
have an almost four-fold higher arrhythmic risk than those with a single mutation. [400] Particular genotypes such as DSP and TMEM43, but
also LMNA and FLNC, associated with other ACM phenotypes (see
section 5.5.4) have a propensity for high arrhythmic burden that can
pre-date the structural phenotype. [401,402]

5.5.2.8 Exercise recommendations

The overall scientific evidence supports the concept that in patients
with ACM participation in high-intensity sports should be discouraged, because it is associated with accelerated disease progression,
greater risk of VAs and major events. This recommendation is also
applicable to genetic carriers of pathogenic variants for ACM even in
the absence of overt disease phenotype.

Refer to Table 4 for different indices of exercise intensity and training zones.


5.5.2.9 Special considerations
Young age of presentation and male sex are associated with
increased risk of malignant arrhythmias in ACM. [379] Although young
age should not exclude an individual from moderate-intensity exercise in the absence of high-risk features, age should be considered in
the discussion with the patient and the parents. In addition, one

�
should consider that specific highly dynamic, start stop sports, such
as basketball and football, may pose a higher risk of SCD particularly
in athletes who compete at the highest level. [17,365]

5.5.2.10 Follow-up
An annual follow-up is recommended for most individuals
with ACM who exercise on a regular basis. More frequent (6monthly) follow-up should be considered for adolescent and
young adults whose ACM phenotype, and therefore risk of SCD,
may still be evolving, particularly if they engage in moderate- to
high-intensity exercise. More frequent follow-up should also be
considered in individuals with high arrhythmic risk genotypes such
as DSP, TMEM43, and carriers of multiple pathogenic variants.
New symptoms should prompt interruption of exercise and re
evaluation.

Recommendations for exercise and sports participation
in individuals with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy







ESC Guidelines 59


5.5.3 Exercise recommendations in individuals with left

ventricular non-compaction
LV non-compaction (LVNC) is an unclassified cardiomyopathy characterized by prominent trabeculation and deep recesses that communicate with the LV cavity. [403,404] Clinical presentation of LVNC
includes progressive LV systolic dysfunction, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. [404]

Athletes often demonstrate LV hypertrabeculation and up to 8% fulfil
the echocardiographic criteria for a diagnosis of LVNC. [405] It is hypothesized that an increased cardiac preload may unmask LV trabecular morphology. [406] Therefore, among athletic individuals, the suspicion of
LVNC should only be considered in those who fulfil echocardiographic
criteria for LVNC but also have either LV systolic dysfunction (EF <
50%), symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease, or a positive family history of LVNC. [407][�][409] Additional echocardiographic criteria include a
very thin compacted epicardial layer (5 mm in end-diastole on CMR, or
<8 mm in systole) and abnormal myocardial relaxation (average E’ < 9
cm/s on tissue Doppler imaging). [404,405,410,411] Such athletes will require
further assessment with CMR, exercise echocardiography, and Holter
monitor to assess the presence of LV fibrosis, cardiac thrombi, contractile reserve, and exercise-induced complex arrhythmias. [405,406]

5.5.3.1 Risk stratification
The clinical outcomes of LVNC are determined by the presence of
symptoms, severity of LV dysfunction, and the nature of the VAs.
There are no reported adverse cardiac events in the absence of LV
dysfunction regardless of the severity of LV trabeculation. [405][�][409]

5.5.3.2 Follow-up
Regular follow-up is recommended for individuals with LVNC. New
symptoms should prompt interruption of exercise and re-evaluation.

5.5.4 Exercise recommendations in individuals with

dilated cardiomyopathy
DCM is characterized by LV or biventricular systolic dysfunction with
or without dilatation that are not explained by abnormal loading conditions or CAD. Possible causes include genetic predisposition, myocarditis, drugs, toxins, peripartum cardiomyopathy, and, in some
cases, the cumulative effect of more than one factor. [412]

The clinical spectrum of disease may range from a mild phenotypic
expression characterized by absence of symptoms, isolated LV dilatation and normal or low-normal systolic function, to an overt disease
phenotype with limiting symptoms and significant systolic dysfunction. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in DCM, particularly in
individuals with previous myocarditis, or with lamin A/C mutations
and filamin C mutations. [413,414] The risk of SCD in DCM is 2�3% per
year and increases with lower EF and higher NYHA class. [415] Exercise
training improves functional capacity, ventricular function, and quality
of life in patients with DCM and should therefore be considered as
an integral part of the management of affected individuals. [416,417]

However, intensive exercise and competitive sports are reported as
a cause of SCD in DCM. [28,46,58,413,418]

LV cavity enlargement in trained individuals that is not associated
with systolic dysfunction and outside the context of a familial disease,
represents a benign physiological adaptation if it is consistent with the
type of sports participated (usually, endurance sports) and the body size

�
of the athlete. Conversely, a mildly reduced EF (45 50%) in an athlete
with an enlarged LV cavity should not merely be considered as a normal
adaptation. In such cases assessment of LV function during exercise may
provide important diagnostic clues. [319] Failure to increase EF at peak
exercise by >10% compared with the baseline value may suggest a
pathological condition. [319,419,420] The presence of diastolic dysfunction
or reduced peak oxygen consumption on CPET may also provide supporting information for the differential diagnosis. CMR has emerged as
an important tool for the diagnosis and risk stratification of DCM.

Specifically, the presence of LGE, with the typical mid-wall distribution,
has been associated with increased risk of VAs and SCD. [319,419,421][�][424]

5.5.4.1 Baseline assessment of patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy
Clinical evaluation of affected individuals who request exercise advice
should aim to: (i) ascertain the potential aetiology; (ii) assess the clinical status including exercise history and functional capacity; (iii)
review the degree of LV dilatation and dysfunction; (iv) assess the
haemodynamic response to exercise; and (v) assess the presence of
exercise-induced symptoms or arrhythmias.
In general, symptomatic individuals with DCM should abstain from
most competitive and leisure sports or recreational exercise associated
with moderate or high exercise intensity. A select group of asymptomatic individuals with DCM who have mildly impaired LV function

�
(LVEF 45 50%) without exercise-induced arrhythmias or significant
myocardial fibrosis may participate in most competitive sports.

5.5.4.2 Special considerations
Although the natural history of most pathogenic variants is unknown, it
would be reasonable to permit intensive exercise and competitive
sports in most individuals with pathogenic variants implicated in DCM in
the absence of overt features of DCM. Special consideration, however,
should be given to individuals with pathogenic variants that are associated with an increased risk of life-threatening arrhythmias such as lamin
A/C or filamin C mutations. There is emerging evidence that exercise
may have an adverse effect on cardiac function and risk for potentially
fatal arrhythmias in individuals harbouring pathogenic variants in lamin
A/C. [425][�][427] Affected individuals should not engage in any competitive
sports or recreational exercise of high or very high intensity irrespective
of the severity of LV dysfunction and dilatation. [428,429]

symptoms should prompt interruption of exercise and re-evaluation

5.5.5 Exercise recommendations in individuals with

myocarditis and pericarditis
5.5.5.1 Myocarditis
Myocarditis is a non-ischaemic inflammatory disease of the myocardium, which may cause cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias.
Myopericarditis is defined as a primary pericarditis with associated
myocardial inflammation and biomarker evidence of myocyte
necrosis. [430,431] The aetiology of myocarditis is heterogenous, but
viral infection is the most common cause in the developed world.
Enterovirus, Coxsackie B virus, parvovirus B-19, and human herpesvirus 6 are the most frequently responsible infectious pathogens. [432,433]

In the context of young individuals, toxins such as cocaine and
amphetamine-based supplements should also be evaluated in the
clinical history. [430]

The clinical presentation is highly variable and the diagnosis can be
challenging. The illness may be proceeded by coryzal symptoms and
athletic individuals may present with non-specific features of general
malaise, fatigue, or diarrhoea. [430,431] At the other extreme, myocarditis
may simulate MI or present with symptomatic supraventricular and
VAs unexplained by other causes, HF, cardiogenic shock, or SCD.
Approximately 50% of individuals reveal full resolution of LV function within 30 days, 25% show persistent cardiac dysfunction, and
12�25% progress to fulminant HF. LV dysfunction is an important
prognostic factor in the long term. [28,434]

ESC Guidelines 61


5.5.5.2 Diagnosis
Serum cardiac troponin is usually elevated in myopericarditis and is a
sensitive marker of cardiac inflammation-induced myocyte
necrosis. [435]

The ECG has low sensitivity and electrical anomalies are nonspecific. ECG patterns vary from non-specific T-wave and STchanges to ST-segment elevation mimicking MI, left bundle branch
block (LBBB), or frequent and/or complex ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, or atrioventricular block, or low QRS voltages in
the presence of a pericardial effusion. [436]

Recognized echocardiographic features of overt myocarditis
include a non-dilated LV cavity with increased myocardial wall thickness (when oedema is present), or mildly dilated LV cavity with a
thinned myocardial wall, usually with regional wall motion abnormalities. [437] The global LV systolic function may range from being almost
normal to severely depressed. Regional wall motion abnormalities
may be present. [438]

CMR is the most useful diagnostic tool and has excellent sensitivity
for detecting myocardial hyperaemia, inflammation, oedema and/or
focal scar. [439,440] The Lake Louise Criteria and LGE are now complemented by CMR techniques of T1/T2 mapping and extracellular volume fraction (ECV). [440][�][442] The extent and distribution of LGE with
non-ischaemic pattern are independent predictors of CV events during follow-up. [439,440,443][�][447] Namely, a 10% increase of LGE volume
conveys a 79% increase in the risk of major CV events. [448,449]

Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of
myocarditis. [450,451] A histological diagnosis allows distinction
between the different types of inflammatory processes, (i.e. giant
cell myocarditis), and guides treatment in life-threatening presentations. [430,445,452] The diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy
can be improved by analysing the viral genome through DNARNA extraction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification, which has the advantage of identifying the disease-causing pathogen. [445]

5.5.5.3 Risk stratification
Case series have established myocarditis as a risk factor for SCD,
which accounts for up to 2�20% of sudden death in athletes. [17,18,28,430,453,454] Murine models have shown that daily exercise

in mice infected with Coxsackie virus is associated with increased
viral titres, fulminant myocarditis, and sudden death. [455] These animal
models provide some insight into the mechanisms of SCD with exercise, which appears to cause an accelerated and progressive inflammatory response. [455][�][458]

5.5.5.4 Exercise recommendations for individuals with myocarditis
Athletic individuals with a probable or definitive diagnosis of recent
myocarditis should be advised to abstain from competitive sports or
leisure sports while active inflammation is present, regardless of age,
sex, or extent of LV systolic dysfunction. [459,460]

The duration of myocardial inflammation can be highly variable
and may take several months for full resolution. Both the ESC and
AHA recommend abstinence from moderate- to high-intensity

exercise for a period of 3 6 months, [459,460] although the precise
timing for return to competitive or recreational sports involving

presence of inflammation on T2-weighted images and LGE uptake
on CMR. [3,461]

Individuals with myocarditis should have a comprehensive evaluation
after complete recovery to assess the risk of exercise-related SCD.
Imaging studies, exercise stress test, and Holter monitor provide essential information for risk stratification. Depressed LV function, presence
of LGE and complex VAs during exercise or Holter monitoring are
recognized risk markers for adverse outcomes. [455,462,463]

Repeat evaluation should consist of measurement of troponin and
biomarkers of inflammation, echocardiography, and prolonged ECG
monitoring. Individuals without evidence of ongoing inflammation
should undergo an exercise stress test. A CMR should be repeated if
myocardial oedema or LGE was present during the acute illness.
Return to sporting activities should be considered, in asymptomatic
individuals, with normal troponin and biomarkers of inflammation,
normal LV systolic function on echocardiography and CMR, no evidence of ongoing inflammation or myocardial fibrosis on CMR, good
functional capacity, and absence of complex arrhythmias during exercise on prolonged ECG monitoring . [430,434,453,459,460,464]

Individuals with previous myocarditis are at risk of recurrence and
silent clinical progression, and the presence of LGE during the acute
presentation is associated with increased incidence of major adverse
cardiac events; therefore, periodic re-evaluation is advised on an
annual basis. [443,445,454,463]

Among individuals with healed myocarditis with persistence of

�
LGE on CMR but no myocardial oedema at 3 6 months, those who
are asymptomatic, with normal troponin and biomarkers of inflammation, normal LV systolic function, no evidence of ongoing inflammation on CMR, and absence of complex arrhythmias during
exercise on prolonged ECG monitoring (48 h Holter ECG and exercise stress testing), should be evaluated on a case by case basis and
may return to competitive sports on an individual basis. In contrast,
individuals with extensive myocardial scar (>20% LGE) and persistent
LV dysfunction should abstain from exercise programmes and sports
activities involving moderate or high physical intensity.

5.5.6 Pericarditis

Pericarditis is defined as an inflammatory disorder of the pericardium, [430,465] which may be preceded by upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. As with myocarditis, viral pathogens are the most
commonly implicated pathogens in the western world.

5.5.6.1 Diagnosis
The ECG is non-specific but may reveal characteristic concave STsegment elevation in most leads and/or PQ depression in the acute
phase. Echocardiography may reveal a pericardial effusion. CMR
should be considered in individuals with raised cardiac troponin levels
to assess for concomitant myocardial inflammation. Furthermore,
CMR will identify active inflammation of the pericardium, thickened
pericardial layers, and any signs of pericardial constriction.

5.5.6.2 Risk stratification
Pericarditis is generally associated with an excellent prognosis. [430,465,466]

However, there are a subset of patients who may be at greater risk of
recurrence and these include individuals with a temperature >38 [�] C at


The ECG has low sensitivity and electrical anomalies are nonspecific. ECG patterns vary from non-specific T-wave and STchanges to ST-segment elevation mimicking MI, left bundle branch
block (LBBB), or frequent and/or complex ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, or atrioventricular block, or low QRS voltages in
the presence of a pericardial effusion. [436]

Recognized echocardiographic features of overt myocarditis
include a non-dilated LV cavity with increased myocardial wall thickness (when oedema is present), or mildly dilated LV cavity with a
thinned myocardial wall, usually with regional wall motion abnormalities. [437] The global LV systolic function may range from being almost
normal to severely depressed. Regional wall motion abnormalities
may be present. [438]

CMR is the most useful diagnostic tool and has excellent sensitivity
for detecting myocardial hyperaemia, inflammation, oedema and/or
focal scar. [439,440] The Lake Louise Criteria and LGE are now complemented by CMR techniques of T1/T2 mapping and extracellular volume fraction (ECV). [440][�][442] The extent and distribution of LGE with
non-ischaemic pattern are independent predictors of CV events during follow-up. [439,440,443][�][447] Namely, a 10% increase of LGE volume
conveys a 79% increase in the risk of major CV events. [448,449]

Endomyocardial biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of
myocarditis. [450,451] A histological diagnosis allows distinction
between the different types of inflammatory processes, (i.e. giant
cell myocarditis), and guides treatment in life-threatening presentations. [430,445,452] The diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy
can be improved by analysing the viral genome through DNARNA extraction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification, which has the advantage of identifying the disease-causing pathogen. [445]


5.5.5.3 Risk stratification
Case series have established myocarditis as a risk factor for SCD,
which accounts for up to 2�20% of sudden death in athletes. [17,18,28,430,453,454] Murine models have shown that daily exercise

in mice infected with Coxsackie virus is associated with increased
viral titres, fulminant myocarditis, and sudden death. [455] These animal
models provide some insight into the mechanisms of SCD with exercise, which appears to cause an accelerated and progressive inflammatory response. [455][�][458]


5.5.5.4 Exercise recommendations for individuals with myocarditis
Athletic individuals with a probable or definitive diagnosis of recent
myocarditis should be advised to abstain from competitive sports or
leisure sports while active inflammation is present, regardless of age,
sex, or extent of LV systolic dysfunction. [459,460]

The duration of myocardial inflammation can be highly variable
and may take several months for full resolution. Both the ESC and
AHA recommend abstinence from moderate- to high-intensity

presentation, large pericardial effusion, and those who are resistant to
therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. [465,466]

5.5.6.3 Exercise recommendations for individuals with pericarditis
Exercise should be avoided in individuals during active pericarditis.
Individuals can return to exercise after complete resolution of the
active disease. [467] Individuals with a milder clinical course and rapid
resolution can return to sporting activities within 30 days. However,
in more severe cases, it may be necessary to wait for a period of 3
months for complete resolution followed by re-evaluation before

returning to sports.
Asymptomatic individuals with a small pericardial effusion occasionally detected on echocardiography in the absence of clinical correlates should be monitored with periodic surveillance, but should
not be restricted from sports participation. Competitive sports and/
or moderate- to high-intensity leisure-time activities should be
avoided in individuals with constrictive pericarditis. Individuals with
myopericarditis should be managed according to the recommendations for myocarditis.

5.6 Exercise recommendations in
individuals with arrhythmias and
channelopathies
5.6.1 A general management framework
When individuals with known arrhythmias or with a potentially
arrhythmogenic condition want to engage in sports activity, three
principle questions should guide management: (1) is there an
increased risk for life-threatening arrhythmias?; (2) how does one
control symptoms due to arrhythmias, during sports, but also at
rest?; and (3) what is the impact of sports on the natural progression
of the arrhythmogenic condition? The general view on the association between sports and arrhythmias is that exercise sets the stage
for an arrhythmia in the context of an underlying and pre-existing
condition, be it structural, electrical, inherited, or acquired. Moreover,
regular exercise programmes may induce or accelerate the progression of ARVC, [382,384] even among those without underlying mutations. [383,387,468] Conceptually, all the structural and functional cardiac
adaptations to regular intensive exercise may contribute to the development of arrhythmias, at the atrial, nodal, and ventricular level. [469]

This concept explains why recommendations for sports participation
in individuals with arrhythmogenic conditions are so complex.

5.6.2 Atrial fibrillation

5.6.2.1 Patients without atrial fibrillation
Moderate, regular PA is a cornerstone in the prevention of AF
through modifying many of its predisposing factors. [297,470][�][473]

Patients at risk of AF should therefore be motivated to exercise (see
section 4.2). Conversely, AF is more prevalent in active and former
male master athletes and those performing high-intensity endurance
sports, suggesting a U-shaped relationship between habitual exercise
and AF. [471,474][�][477 478][�][481] This association has not been confirmed in
women. [474]

5.6.2.2 Prognostic and symptomatic relevance of AF during sports
Underlying structural heart disease or pre-excitation should always
be excluded before advising sports activity in individuals with recognized AF. It is also important to exclude hyperthyroidism, alcohol
abuse, and (illicit) drug use. Intensive sports participation should be
temporarily stopped until an identified underlying cause is corrected.
Rapid atrioventricular nodal conduction of AF during exercise may
lead to symptoms, including dizziness, syncope, fatigue, or impaired
physical performance. Therefore, the individual should be instructed to
stop PA on the emergence of symptoms and rate control should be
optimized. Rapid 1: 1 conduction can occur, especially during atrial
tachycardia or atrial flutter (AFL); therefore, if AFL has been documented, prophylactic cavo-tricuspid isthmus ablation should be considered. If there is evidence for adequate rate control while in AF through
an exercise stress test or ECG monitoring during training or competition, all sports participation is possible in asymptomatic individuals.
Achieving adequate rate control can be difficult, however. Betablockers are the logical choice but may not be tolerated due to their
impact on physical performance. Calcium-channel blockers and digitalis are usually not potent enough when used alone. Often a combination of individually titrated negatively chronotropic agents is
needed, while avoiding sinus bradycardia at rest or chronotropic
incompetence during exercise.
Rhythm control is equally complicated. Class III antiarrhythmic drugs
are usually insufficient for control (sotalol) or relatively contraindicated
in a young population (amiodarone). Although class I drugs may be able
to prevent recurrences of AF, they should not be used in monotherapy,
since these may increase the propensity to develop AFL (‘class I AFL’),
which in the absence of adequate rate control may lead to 1: 1 atrioventricular conduction, high ventricular rates, and very profound intraventricular conduction slowing, with haemodynamic compromise. [482,483]

Therefore, prophylactic cavo-tricuspid-isthmus ablation should be considered if class I drugs are prescribed in monotherapy in athletes.
In patients with sporadic AF, class I drugs may be considered only
for acute cardioversion, i.e. as a ‘pill-in-the-pocket’ approach. These
patients should refrain from sports as long as AF persists, and until
two half-lives of the antiarrhythmic drug have passed. [484]

Prescription of oral anticoagulants (OAC) depends on the clinical
risk profile (mainly CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score). [485] Sports with direct bodily
contact or prone to trauma should be avoided in patients on OAC. [486]

Catheter ablation by pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) should be considered if drug therapy fails or as first-line therapy if drug therapy is not
desired. [487] Several small series have shown that the outcome of PVI in

athletes with paroxysmal AF is similar to that in non-athletic
patients. [488,489]

5.6.2.3 Impact of sports continuation on the natural progression of atrial
fibrillation after ablation

If there are no recurrences of AF within 1 month of a successful abla
tion procedure, sports activity may be resumed. It is unknown
whether continuation of sports after successful PVI might progress
the disease process and lead to recurrence of non-pulmonary veindependent AF in the future. Therefore, no firm recommendation can
be made about the ‘safe’ dose of sports after ablation.

5.6.3 Supraventricular tachycardia and Wolff-ParkinsonWhite syndrome
The term paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) includes
(i) atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT; most common); (ii) atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT) involving an
accessory pathway; or (iii) atrial tachycardia.
Ventricular pre-excitation on the resting ECG is due to an accessory pathway (AP) with antegrade conduction. The prevalence of
pre-excitation in the general population varies from 0.1�0.3%. [491,492]

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is defined as the presence
of paroxysmal arrhythmias in a patient with pre-excitation.

5.6.3.1 Prognostic and symptomatic relevance of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia without pre-excitation
PSVT without pre-excitation and without associated structural heart
disease is not life-threatening, although the arrhythmia may result in
dizziness and exhaustion that requires cessation of exercise. Syncope
is uncommon. Pre-excitation, however, may be associated with sudden death (see later); therefore, it is important to exclude the presence of latent pre-excitation, by performing carotid sinus massage or
an adenosine-test in sinus rhythm. [493]

Athletes with PSVT should stop exercise in the event of palpitations since rapid heart rates may cause (pre)syncope. Individuals with
proven PSVT without pre-excitation should be educated on how to
safely perform vagal manoeuvres (such as carotid sinus massage or,
preferably, Valsalva manoeuvre) to facilitate termination of the
arrhythmia. [494] Exercise may be resumed after termination of the
arrhythmia. Prophylactic drug treatment with beta-blockers or calcium antagonists with atrioventricular nodal blocking properties can
be considered, although it has limited efficacy. Class I drugs have no
role in the management of PSVT, since they can cause lifethreatening arrhythmias (see earlier).
If competitive athletic activity is desired, curative treatment by
ablation should be considered. Ablation outcome is equally safe and
has similar acute success rates in athletes and non-athletes. [495] If the

PSVT is only sporadic and transient and not associated with haemodynamic consequences, even when it develops during exercise, or in

. [..................................................................................................................]


excludes non-intermittent latent pre-excitation. Pre-excitation may be
intermittent, which usually indicates low risk properties of the pathway.
However, some accessory pathways may be potentiated by adrenergic
stimuli. Therefore, exercise testing excluding pre-excitation at peak
exercise is recommended before clearance for sports.
Ablation of the AP is recommended in competitive and recreational athletes with pre-excitation and documented arrhythmias. In
the event of transient, infrequent well-tolerated arrhythmia (even
during exercise), good anticipation of an ablation procedure with
increased risk (e.g. anteroseptal AP), or reluctance of the athlete to
undergo ablation, management should be guided by assessment of
the antegrade conduction characteristics of the AP using either noninvasive tests or an invasive electrophysiological (EP) study.
Non-invasive investigation examines for intermittent preexcitation on ECG or Holter, for abrupt disappearance of preexcitation after administration of a low dose of class I drugs, or for its
abrupt disappearance during an exercise test. [497] In cases of a long
refractory period and hence low risk for sudden death, continuation
of sports activity is permitted without ablation on the understanding
that sporting activity should be stopped in the event of recurrence of
palpitations.
In competitive athletes with asymptomatic pre-excitation an EP
study is warranted to evaluate the risk for sudden death. In the event
of a high-risk finding (Table 15), ablation of the AP is recommended.
For athletes who refuse ablation, or if the procedure is associated
with high risk, such as an anteroseptal accessory pathway, participation in competitive sports activities can be discussed on an individual
case by case basis including the use of pharmacological therapy,
although there are currently no data about its efficacy. Sports in
which the potential loss of consciousness could be fatal should be
discouraged.
In recreational athletes with asymptomatic pre-excitation, risk
assessment may first be pursued via non-invasive testing. [497] The sensitivity of non-invasive screening for AP properties that facilitate a fast
ventricular response to AF/AFL is good, but its specificity is low. [498]

Of note, in children younger than 12 years, the risk of AF-induced
VF and sudden death is very low. Generally, a conservative approach

If competitive athletic activity is desired, curative treatment by

has similar acute success rates in athletes and non-athletes. [495] If the

PSVT is only sporadic and transient and not associated with haemodynamic consequences, even when it develops during exercise, or in
cases where ablation is not desired or unsuccessful, sports activity is
permissible when there is no increased risk of a fatality from a potential loss of consciousness (such as motorsports drivers, parachute
jumpers, divers, and so on).


5.6.3.2 Prognostic and symptomatic relevance of pre-excitation
It has been estimated that one third of patients with WPW syndrome
may develop AF and, in such cases, rapid conduction over the AP can
lead to ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden death. Given the fact
that AF is more common in athletes, pre-excitation constitutes a
prognostic concern in athletes. The risk for sudden death in patients
with pre-excitation varies in population-based studies from
0.15�0.20%, and usually presents during exercise or emotional
stress. [496]

Evaluation of the athlete with ventricular pre-excitation should

exclude associated structural cardiac disease, such as HCM or Ebstein

anomaly. Minimal or ‘latent’ pre-excitation can be unmasked on a 12lead ECG during sinus rhythm by vagal manoeuvres or intravenous
administration of adenosine. Prolongation of the PR interval without a
change in the QRS morphology, or transient atrioventricular block,

ESC Guidelines 65


is recommended in this age group, although one study [499] suggested
that prophylactic assessment and ablation reduces the risk of sudden
death. There is a knowledge gap in the benefit/risk ratio of this
approach and large-scale studies are required to address the issue.
Leisure-time and low- to medium-intensity exercise programmes
can generally be resumed 1 week after ablation if there is no particular risk of recurrence of arrhythmia.

�
Resuming competitive sports is possible after 1 3 months, with
further ECG follow-up at 6 months and 1 year (given the very small
risk for late recurrence of pre-excitation).
Although there may be an association between (type of) AVNRT
and history of sports, there are no data about higher recurrence rate
post ablation when sports are resumed or not, and hence no reason
to limit exercise programmes for such reason.

unfavourable prognosis even in asymptomatic individuals. Specific

apex or free wall of the LV or RV), high burden, complexity (e.g. couplets, triplets, or non-sustained runs), multifocal origin, and/or
increasing frequency with exercise should alert to the possibility of
electrical, ischaemic, or structural heart disease. [505,506]

There is no absolute threshold of the number of PVCs that can be

used as a cut-off for underlying disease. One study has shown that in
asymptomatic athletes with >2000 PVCs per day, there was a 30%
chance of finding an underlying structural or cardio-genetic
disease. [503]

5.6.4.2 Morphology of premature ventricular contractions
The morphology of the PVCs may provide important prognostic
information since some foci of origin are recognized as benign. The
most prevalent entity in this respect are PVCs originating from the
right or left ventricular outflow regions (RVOT/LVOT), showing a
clear inferior axis with high voltages in the inferior limb leads. Early
precordial transition (in V2, and certainly when V1 shows a right bundle branch morphology) suggests a left-sided origin. [507] RVOT/LVOT
PVCs are thought to be the result of triggered activity, i.e. a local cellular cause, which has no negative prognostic implications. Although
these RVOT/LVOT arrhythmias usually occur in structurally normal
hearts, they may be the expression of subclinical arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Cardiac imaging tests can help exclude structural heart

disease in such athletes.

Less common locations of focal PVCs are around the mitral or tri
cuspid annulus, most often in a postero-septal location. These have a
superior axis with LBBB or RBBB morphology. The PVCs originating
from the His-Purkinje system typically have relatively narrow QRS
complex with RBBB morphology and either left anterior or left posterior hemi-block. Lastly, intramyocardial foci may occur, often
related to the papillary muscles or moderator band. [508]

PVCs of differing morphologies from the RV (i.e., wide LBBB and
superior axis) in individuals with normal LV function should prompt
investigations to exclude arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy or sarcoidosis. Similarly, wide RBBB pattern, with superior axis and multifocal
PVCs of LV origin should trigger investigations for non-ischaemic
cardiomyopathy.
Very rarely, otherwise ‘benign’ PVCs arising from the Purkinje network may give rise to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) or
VF due to their short coupling interval. [509,510] In such patients, the
malignant electrical presentation mandates aggressive treatment.
Finally, frequent but otherwise benign PVCs (usually defined as
>10�15% of the total number of beats per 24 h) can impair LV function over time (PVC-induced cardiomyopathy), which may be reversible with medical treatment or catheter ablation. [511,512]

5.6.4.3 Premature ventricular contractions: response to exercise
Reduction or resolution of PVCs with increasing exercise load is typical of idiopathic and benign VAs, particularly those with an outflow
tract morphology. [513,514] PVCs induced by exercise should be considered as a ‘red flag’, because VAs associated with heart diseases are
often made worse by adrenergic stimulation. [19,502,511,512,515][�][520] A
higher prevalence of myocardial substrates (mainly mid-wall or subepicardial non-ischaemic LV scars) was found in a CMR study among
athletes with exercise-induced PVCs compared to those with
exercise-suppressed VAs (56% vs. 21%). [516]

Of note, exercise-induced isolated or repetitive PVCs with multiple morphologies, especially with beat-to-beat alternating morphologies (so-called ‘bi-directional’ pattern), may be the expression of
catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, which can degenerate into
VF. [518,521]

5.6.4.4 Practical management of cardiac patients with premature ventricular contractions or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia who want

to engage in sports
The most important task in individuals with PVCs or NSVT who
want to engage in sports is to exclude underlying structural or familial
arrhythmogenic conditions, since sports activity may trigger sustained
VT. It has been suggested that the presence of >_2 PVCs on a baseline
ECG (or even >_1 PVC in the case of high-endurance athletes) should
prompt a more thorough evaluation. [522] Work-up includes a family
history, assessment of the number, morphology, and complexity of
PVCs by Holter and 12-lead ECG, inducibility by exertion (via exercise test or long-term ECG recording during sports activities), and
tailored additional imaging. [1] Further diagnostic evaluation with
molecular genetic testing may be indicated in selected cases if the suspicion for familial disease is high. Finally, repeat evaluation may be
needed after 6 months to 2 years. Recommendations for sports participation of athletes with PVC should be individualized based on
evaluation for underlying cardiac conditions as described earlier, and
often requires shared decision making.

5.6.5 Long QT syndrome
The QT and corrected QTc intervals vary by sex and
physical training. Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) should be
distinguished from acquired forms, i.e. due to circumstances, which
can be reversed and prevented. Once acquired LQTS is established,
sports activity should be prohibited until the underlying cause is

corrected.
A definitive diagnosis of congenital LQTS is often difficult. [523]

Congenital LQTS should be suspected on a routine ECG or 4 min
into recovery after an exercise stress test, [524] if the corrected QTc
interval according to Bazett’s formula is >_470 ms or >_480 ms in
asymptomatic male or female athletes, respectively. [525] A QTc of
>_500 ms is diagnostic. [526] In the case of a borderline long QTc
interval and a negative personal and familial history, subclinical
arrhythmias should be excluded by exercise testing and long-term
ECG recording.
Since the risk of cardiac events during sports activities is largely
gene-specific, genetic testing and cascade screening of family members
should be performed following a clinical diagnosis of LQTS. Individuals
with LQT1 are at highest risk during stressful exercise. [527,528]

Symptomatic athletes should not engage in competitive sports.
Individuals with LQT1 should not engage in sports that involve diving into cold water since this is associated with increased risk of
arrhythmias. General precautions include avoidance of QTprolonging drugs, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Betablocker therapy is extremely effective in LQT1 and additional
therapies are only needed to control more severe cases or specific
genotypes. [529]

Survivors of SCA (certainly while taking beta-blocker therapy)
should be referred for an ICD. Similarly, individuals who have experienced sudden syncope despite beta-blocker therapy should also be
referred for an ICD or sympathetic cardiac denervation. [530] ICD
implantation does not constitute clearance for intensive or competitive sports. Continued sports participation with an ICD is possible,
but specific recommendations apply (see section 5.5.6). American
guidelines are more lenient with respect to participation in competitive sport (except for LQT1), provided that precautions include the
presence of an automatic external defibrillator (AED) ‘as part of the
athlete’s personal sports safety gear’. [531] We consider such obligation
to be impractical (e.g. winter sports, water sports), and it places an
added responsibility on clubs or other bystanders, which cannot be
justified by a medical recommendation for an individual athlete.
Moreover, although LQTS-related cardiac arrest is uncommon, even
during competitive sports, [527] AED efficacy is not 100% in such
cases. [532]

In asymptomatic LQTS mutation carriers without a prolonged QT
interval, i.e. <470 ms in men and <480 ms in women (‘genotype positive/phenotype negative’), shared decision making is required, balancing the risk for arrhythmias with psychological well-being. A negative
exercise stress test has no predictive value.

pattern, preventive measures are recommended, such as avoidance
of triggering drugs (www.brugadadrugs.org), electrolyte imbalance,
and increases in core temperature >39 [�] C (e.g. by minimizing immersion in hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms; by avoiding sports in
warm/humid conditions; or by abstaining from prolonged endurance
events such as triathlons and marathons). During febrile illness, fever
should be treated aggressively. [247,511]

One could speculate that an enhanced vagal reaction during recovery [550] and a predominant vagal tone at rest [551] may increase the susceptibility of highly trained individuals to develop arrhythmias during
recovery or at rest. However, there are no reports directly linking
exercise or sports training to cardiac events and there are no large
prospective studies evaluating the effect of exercise and sports in

BrS.

Asymptomatic patients with the spontaneous type I BrS ECG pattern may compete in all sports except endurance sports associated
with an increase in core temperature >39 [�] C (e.g. marathon running
and triathlons). Similar rules apply to asymptomatic genotypepositive/phenotype-negative individuals and those with the concealed

form of BrS.

If treated with an ICD, provided precautionary measures are taken
and the patient has been asymptomatic for >_3 months, resumption
of all sport, including competitive sport, may be considered, after
shared decision making, and also taking into consideration the findings
from the ICD registry (see later).

5.6.6 Brugada syndrome
The Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited cardiac ion channel dis
order with an elevated risk of VF and SCD in individuals with a structurally normal heart. [533,534] Although BrS was initially described as a
purely electrical disease, minor structural RV abnormalities have
been described, [535][�][538] suggesting that the disease may be the result
of early repolarization or delayed depolarization. [509] The diagnosis is
based on the presence of the type 1 Brugada pattern on the 12-lead
ECG (coved-type ST-segment elevation >_2 mm followed by a negative T-wave in >_1 mm of the right precordial leads positioned in the
fourth, third, or second intercostal space), either spontaneously or
following provocation by a sodium ion channel blocker. [523,539,540]

Most individuals with BrS remain asymptomatic throughout their
lives. In the majority of cases, events occur during sleep or rest, during febrile states or, occasionally, from heat stroke. [541][�][549] Patients
who have suffered a SCA or an arrhythmic syncope should undergo
ICD implantation. [247,511] Risk stratification in the asymptomatic population with spontaneous type 1 ECG pattern is more challenging. [247,511] There is controversial evidence that exercise testing
showing an aggravating phenotype during exercise or early recovery,
or EP study, are efficient at detecting individuals at risk of SCD. In
asymptomatic patients with only inducible type 1 Brugada ECG

5.6.7 Following device implantation

5.6.7.1 Pacemakers

Pacemaker (PM) implantation is common. Generally, individuals
implanted with a PM have less severe disease and comorbidities than
patients with an ICD. Moreover, there is less risk of malfunction for a
PM than for an ICD during sports. [552] For all these reasons, recommendations for sports practice are more liberal in patients with a PM
than in patients with an ICD. Patients with a PM may participate in
competitive or recreational sports in the absence of structural or
other heart disease for which exercise may be prohibited.
In the first weeks after device implantation, sports activities that
increase the risk of lead dislocation (e.g. strong upper extremity
movements) should be avoided. Exercise testing and/or Holter monitoring during sports may improve individualized programming of the
upper sensor and the tracking rate and exclude inappropriate rate
acceleration in other circumstances (e.g. horse riding). [553]

For all patients with cardiac devices (PM, cardiac resynchronization
therapy, and ICD), sports activities associated with a risk of chest
trauma should be avoided. [554][�][557] Some sports such as soccer, basketball, and baseball may be possible while wearing appropriate padding. It is noteworthy that sports with pronounced arm movements
such as volleyball, basketball, tennis, golf, and climbing may increase
the risk for late lead damage due to subclavian crush (with insulation
or conductor failure). [554,558,559] Implantation on the contralateral side
of the dominant arm, fixation within the pocket, or submuscular
placement may improve durability of the system. It is not known
whether subcostal or epicardial implant techniques provide longterm benefit. Electromagnetic interference is unlikely with modern
devices, and no cases have been reported, but it should always be
suspected and closely evaluated in specific athletic environments
with electronic equipment (e.g. fencing). Myopotential inhibition may
result in inhibition of pacing, a problem that is more common with
unipolar electrodes, although it can usually be corrected with appropriate reprogramming of the device. [560,561] Bipolar leads are less sensitive to this problem, but may have a reduced longevity.

5.6.7.2 Implantable cardioverter defibrillators
A large multinational ICD Sports Safety Registry has shown that after
a median follow-up of 44 months, there were no deaths or arrhythmia or shock-related physical injury in 440 athletes who continued
organized competitive or high-risk sports after ICD implantation. [359,389] An additional analysis in 82 non-professional recreational
athletes confirmed these reassuring outcomes, [562] which is relevant
for the many ICD recipients who want to continue recreational
sports activities after implantation. Therefore, shared decision making
is appropriate when deciding whether or not to continue sports and
the level of participation with an ICD.

. [...............................................................................................................................................]


However, three important considerations come into play. First, if
sport is contraindicated because it can contribute to the progression
of the underlying disease (such as in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy
or lamin A/C mutations), [384,425] an ICD cannot be considered as a
substitute for sports restriction, and participation in moderate- and
high-intensity exercise should be discouraged. Recommendations in
such circumstances should have a lifetime perspective and be based
on the optimal preservation of structural cardiac integrity. The ICD,
however, may allow for light to moderate exercise without concerns
about risk of arrhythmia or shocks, and may help individuals to regain
autonomy and overcome fears relating to exercising unattended.
The second consideration is that ICD shocks in general, even
when appropriate and safe, will have a psychological impact on the

�
athlete; 30 40% of the athletes who experienced shocks in the multinational ICD Sports Safety Registry stopped participation, at least
temporarily, out of fear of repeat shocks. [389] Moreover, the proportion of athletes with appropriate and inappropriate shocks during
exercise was higher in competitive than in recreational sports,
emphasizing the known triggering effect of high-intensity exercise. [562]

Considering that ICD therapy is lifelong, where quality of life is not
only dependent on the ability to perform sports activities, but also
and mostly on continued trust in the device, physicians should be
aware that their own belief in the effectiveness and safety of ICD
therapy during sports should not implicitly put pressure on the athlete to continue sports. Again, informed decision making needs to reevaluate all options of the athlete aftershocks, including continuing,
reducing, or stopping sports. [563,564]

Third, situations where loss of focus or loss of consciousness could

cause harm to a third party or the athlete (such as in motor sports,
diving, mountain climbing, even cycling) should be avoided.
The athlete must be aware of the programmed detection rate cutoffs to be able to avoid reaching those during exercise. Conversely,
detection zones need to be programmed sufficiently high to allow for
adequately high heart rates during the desired exercise levels. This
practice proved safe and reduced the occurrence of shocks in the
ICD Sports Safety Database. [565] The most common cause of inappropriate shocks in individuals with an ICD is the occurrence of sinus
tachycardia and supraventricular arrhythmias. [566,567] Underlying heart
disease and endurance sport itself carries a higher risk for developing
AF. [474,480,568] Implantation of a dual system ICD for the sole reason of
atrial arrhythmia detection and discrimination is not warranted
because it is usually not effective. [565,569][�][572] Given the fact that many
of these athletes are young, there is a higher risk for long-term lead
complications when more leads are implanted; therefore, implantation of more complex ICD systems, and their indication, should be
weighed in every patient. Routine inclusion of athletes in remote
monitoring programmes is highly recommended.


For all patients with cardiac devices (PM, cardiac resynchronization
therapy, and ICD), sports activities associated with a risk of chest
trauma should be avoided. [554][�][557] Some sports such as soccer, basketball, and baseball may be possible while wearing appropriate padding. It is noteworthy that sports with pronounced arm movements
such as volleyball, basketball, tennis, golf, and climbing may increase
the risk for late lead damage due to subclavian crush (with insulation
or conductor failure). [554,558,559] Implantation on the contralateral side
of the dominant arm, fixation within the pocket, or submuscular
placement may improve durability of the system. It is not known
whether subcostal or epicardial implant techniques provide longterm benefit. Electromagnetic interference is unlikely with modern
devices, and no cases have been reported, but it should always be
suspected and closely evaluated in specific athletic environments
with electronic equipment (e.g. fencing). Myopotential inhibition may
result in inhibition of pacing, a problem that is more common with
unipolar electrodes, although it can usually be corrected with appropriate reprogramming of the device. [560,561] Bipolar leads are less sensitive to this problem, but may have a reduced longevity.

defect, its physiological consequences, and the effect of surgical or

transcatheter intervention.

5.7.2 The increasing numbers of athletes with congenital

heart disease

Athletes with CHD include those with minor unoperated lesions and
palliated and repaired CHD. Some athletes will be diagnosed with
CHD for the first time during pre-participation screening.
Approximately 1 in 150 adults have a congenital heart defect. This is an
increase of over 50% in the last 10 years and reflects improved diagnosis and long-term survival. [575] Overall 90% of adults with CHD are in
NYHA functional class I or II. [576] The number of professional and recreational athletes with CHD is unknown but the elite athlete population is likely to be small. In a study of 2352 Olympian athletes, only nine
(0.4%) had a congenital heart defect. [577] However, many more CHD
patients compete at a recreational level. It is likely that the number of
athletes with CHD is increasing due to improved survival, better
understanding of the benefits of exercise, and the increased number of
professional athletes from countries where poorly developed healthcare systems are associated with under-diagnosis of CHD. [573,574]

5.7.3 Non-cardiac abnormalities in congenital heart disease and Paralympic sport
CHD has a multifactorial aetiology, but there is a significant genetic
component and a recurrence risk of 2�5%. [578] The genetic origin
may be due to a chromosome anomaly, a heritable syndrome with
Mendelian pattern, or sporadic with variable penetrance. [578]

Approximately 14% of patients with CHD have additional noncardiac abnormalities. [579] Thus, 44% of ACHD patients have lung
function abnormalities. [580] This can make advising sports participation
for the ACHD athlete more difficult. There is no specific classification
for CHD in Paralympic sport.

5.7.4 General considerations in the congenital heart

disease athlete

There is considerable variation in the haemodynamic consequences
and prognosis of different CHD lesions. Furthermore, the consequences of any individual lesion can vary hugely between individuals. Thus,
Ebstein’s anomaly may present in infancy with pulmonary hypoplasia
due to compression by a giant right atrium or may present in late middle age with supraventricular tachycardia and minimal haemodynamic
consequences. Similarly, a ventricular septal defect may be small and
asymptomatic, or large presenting with HF in infancy, or may present
with extreme cyanosis, reduced exercise capacity, and Eisenmenger
syndrome in the adult. Consequently, these recommendations are
based on a physiological assessment rather than underlying anatomic
diagnosis. An understanding of the range of severity and a lesion-based
knowledge of potential complications is essential. The cardiologist
should work in conjunction with a CHD specialist. Athletes with CHD
who participate in regular training and competitive sports should
undergo a comprehensive annual assessment that includes clinical
examination, ECG, echocardiogram, and exercise stress test, ideally

CPET.

Many athletes with CHD will have undergone corrective or palliative surgery. In young adults with post-surgical CHD, valve

5.7 Exercise recommendations in
individuals with adult congenital heart
disease

5.7.1 Introduction

�
Congenital heart disease (CHD) has a prevalence of 8 9 per 1000
live births and is the most common birth defect. [573] Most children

with CHD survive to adulthood, including over 85% with complex
disease. Regular exercise is important for adults with congenital heart
disease (ACHD) and exercise participation should be discussed at
every patient encounter. [574] However, CHD represents a spectrum
of conditions with widely varying physiological consequences.
Individualized assessment is essential before advising on sports participation. This requires detailed understanding of the congenital heart


. [.......................................................................................................................................................................]

70 ESC Guidelines


incompetence and arrhythmias are common problems, but with
increasing age arrhythmias and HF predominate. In master athletes,
problems related to previous corrective or palliative surgery become
prevalent. These include cardiac arrhythmias, systemic ventricular
dysfunction, valvar incompetence, and prosthetic conduit obstruction. Redo valve or conduit surgery and arrhythmia ablation due to
re-entry arrhythmias (secondary to surgical scar) are frequent in this
age group. In addition, with increasing age, acquired CVD may
develop. [581,582] This is of particular relevance in the assessment of the

master athlete with CHD.

5.7.5 Sudden death during sport
SCD in CHD is rare (<0.1% per year) [583] and only 8% of deaths occur
during exercise. [584] Many complex CHD patients at highest risk of
SCD have reduced exercise tolerance and cannot participate in significant athletic activity. However, some diagnostic groups, e.g. post
tetralogy of Fallot repair, carry a risk of SCD but can still compete in
elite sport. [585] Other high-risk congenital lesions such as anomalous
coronary origin, mitral valve prolapse, and aortopathy are described
in sections 5.1, 5.3, and 5.4, respectively. In a large population-based
study of SCD in CHD patients under 35 years, 87% of SCD was due
to a presumed arrhythmia and 41% occurred in patients with undiagnosed CHD. [586] Activity-related SCD was more common in the
undiagnosed group (18% vs. 4%), which supports the case for preparticipation athletic screening. [586] It is not known whether exercise
intensity is a risk factor for SCD in CHD. There is reasonable evidence that moderate to vigorous exercise is safe in most ACHD

�
patients even when symptomatic (NYHA II III). [576,587,588] However,
cardiac arrhythmias are a common cause of hospital admission in
ACHD and extreme exercise may expose a latent arrhythmic
substrate. [589,590]

5.7.6 Exercise in athletes with congenital heart disease:
current guidelines and recommendations
Regular structured exercise is safe and effective therapy for most
patients with CHD. This is true for most diagnostic groups, including
symptomatic patients, and includes aerobic and strength-based exercise. [588,591][�][596] Exercise intolerance in CHD is a strong predictor of
both outcome and SCD. [576] Specific precautions are necessary in
extreme environments including underwater sports and this is considered below (see Supplementary Data, section 4). This is particularly
true if there is a potential for a right to left shunt. Guidelines are available for exercise assessment and prescription in both children and
adults with CHD, although these are not specifically designed for the
athlete. [597,598] The paediatric guidelines are based primarily on the
underlying anatomical diagnosis, but the teenage and young adult
CHD guidelines have taken a functional approach based on underlying haemodynamics and arrhythmia risk. This latter approach is better
suited for assessment of the ACHD athlete (Figure 9).

5.7.7 Assessment of the athlete with congenital heart

disease

The guidelines for exercise prescription in adolescents and adults
with CHD use a structured methodology described by Budts et al. [597]

This can be modified for use in the assessment of athletes with CHD. . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Stage 1. A full history and physical examination are carried out.
This should include details of underlying CHD diagnosis, any transcatheter or surgical interventions, current medications and CV symptoms (at rest and on exercise). Attention should be paid to any
associated non-cardiac diagnoses including pulmonary dysfunction. A
full exercise and sports participation history should be taken including
precise details of current training schedule and any dietary supplements. Details of the planned or current sports activity should be
established to include an assessment of the static component and
intensity as described in section 4.1 (see Figure 2). If necessary, advice
should be sought from a sports fitness coach or sports medicine
specialist.
Stage 2. The following five baseline parameters should then be
evaluated [597] (Table 16).

(1) Ventricular function

Assessment of ventricular function can usually be achieved using
echocardiography. The aim is to establish whether function is

�
reduced (EF < 55%), and if so, is it mild (45 55%), moderate

�
(30 45%), or severe (<30%). This is used for baseline assessment
and subsequent monitoring of the effects of exercise training.
Echocardiography can also evaluate inflow and outflow abnormalities,
which may become more severe during acute exercise (e.g. LV outflow obstruction or systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation).
CMR scanning may be a preferable modality in complex disease. This
has the additional benefit of evaluating intracardiac scar, which may
inform the assessment of arrhythmia risk. [599,600]

(2) Pulmonary artery pressure

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is diagnosed when the mean PAP is

�
>20 mmHg. [601] PH may occur in the context of a chronic left right
shunt (e.g. atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus
arteriosus) that allows unrestricted volume/pressure overload.
Eventually this can result in supra-normal PAP with reversal of shunting and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (Eisenmenger syndrome). An increased RV afterload limits the ability to increase
cardiac output by increasing stroke volume and can impair LV function through disruption of normal RV�LV interaction.
Few CHD patients with significant PH will take part in competitive
sports due to reduced exercise capacity. However, some athletes
with CHD will have mild elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance
that may be exacerbated by factors such as altitude training. [602] PAP
rises during exercise. This rise is accentuated with increasing age and
may be exaggerated in CHD athletes due to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. [603] In addition, valvar pulmonary stenosis or distal
stenoses in branch pulmonary arteries may cause exercise-related
RV hypertension. The non-invasive assessment of PH can be difficult
and full assessment guidelines have been published. [604,605] Further
information can be gained by CPET and a VO 2 of >25.2 mL/min/kg
makes significant PH unlikely. [606] As PH can also be a late postoperative complication after surgical correction of CHD [607] the assessment
of PAP should be part of every echocardiographic examination in athletes with CHD. Although exercise training is generally regarded as
safe in PH, competitive sport is not recommended. [1,608]

(3) Aortic assessment

Many CHD patients are at risk of aortic dilatation, in particular,
patients with tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta and certain


5.7.5 Sudden death during sport
SCD in CHD is rare (<0.1% per year) [583] and only 8% of deaths occur
during exercise. [584] Many complex CHD patients at highest risk of
SCD have reduced exercise tolerance and cannot participate in significant athletic activity. However, some diagnostic groups, e.g. post
tetralogy of Fallot repair, carry a risk of SCD but can still compete in
elite sport. [585] Other high-risk congenital lesions such as anomalous
coronary origin, mitral valve prolapse, and aortopathy are described
in sections 5.1, 5.3, and 5.4, respectively. In a large population-based
study of SCD in CHD patients under 35 years, 87% of SCD was due
to a presumed arrhythmia and 41% occurred in patients with undiagnosed CHD. [586] Activity-related SCD was more common in the
undiagnosed group (18% vs. 4%), which supports the case for preparticipation athletic screening. [586] It is not known whether exercise
intensity is a risk factor for SCD in CHD. There is reasonable evidence that moderate to vigorous exercise is safe in most ACHD

�
patients even when symptomatic (NYHA II III). [576,587,588] However,
cardiac arrhythmias are a common cause of hospital admission in
ACHD and extreme exercise may expose a latent arrhythmic
substrate. [589,590]


5.7.6 Exercise in athletes with congenital heart disease:
current guidelines and recommendations
Regular structured exercise is safe and effective therapy for most
patients with CHD. This is true for most diagnostic groups, including
symptomatic patients, and includes aerobic and strength-based exercise. [588,591][�][596] Exercise intolerance in CHD is a strong predictor of
both outcome and SCD. [576] Specific precautions are necessary in
extreme environments including underwater sports and this is considered below (see Supplementary Data, section 4). This is particularly
true if there is a potential for a right to left shunt. Guidelines are available for exercise assessment and prescription in both children and
adults with CHD, although these are not specifically designed for the
athlete. [597,598] The paediatric guidelines are based primarily on the
underlying anatomical diagnosis, but the teenage and young adult
CHD guidelines have taken a functional approach based on underlying haemodynamics and arrhythmia risk. This latter approach is better
suited for assessment of the ACHD athlete (Figure 9).


5.7.7 Assessment of the athlete with congenital heart

disease

The guidelines for exercise prescription in adolescents and adults
with CHD use a structured methodology described by Budts et al. [597]

This can be modified for use in the assessment of athletes with CHD.

ESC Guidelines 71

syndromes such as 22q11 microdeletion and Turner syndrome.
However, aortic dissection is very rare in CHD. [609] Athletes have
mildly increased aortic dimensions in comparison to sedentary con
trols, but it is not known if this has a cumulative effect in CHD athletes with aortic dilatation. [345] The presence of ascending aorta

dilatation should lead to assessment for coarctation of the aorta as

this can be associated with severe coarctation, which may be missed
on clinical assessment but may cause severe exercise-related hypertension. [610] Exercise risks in aortopathy are described in detail in section 5.4. Contact sports should be avoided in patients with dilated

aortas >5 cm.

(4) Arrhythmia assessment

Arrhythmias are responsible for 25% of CHD hospital admissions.
Over 80% are atrial but life-threatening VAs can occur. [611]

Independent risk factors include increasing age, male gender, double
outlet right ventricle, atrioventricular septal defect, HF, obstructive
sleep apnoea, transposition of the great arteries, congenitally corrected transposition, and tetralogy of Fallot. [599] Assessment of the
CHD athlete should include a symptom history with evaluation of
palpitations, presyncope and syncope, particularly during exercise.

Arrhythmias may be the first sign of underlying haemodynamic deterioration and new-onset arrhythmias should lead to a full haemody. [......]
namic assessment. Detailed guidelines for the assessment and
treatment of arrhythmias in CHD are available. [612] In the athlete,
arrhythmia therapy may be complicated by the need to minimize the
negative chronotropic effects of antiarrhythmic treatment, which
may affect performance. If symptomatic arrhythmias are present then
an exercise ECG, prolonged ECG monitoring, loop recorder implantation, and even electrophysiology testing might be required. This
should be coordinated by an electrophysiologist with expertise in

CHD.

(5) Assessment of saturations/lung function

CHD athletes should be assessed for the potential of an underlying
intracardiac right to left shunt. This can be assessed using pulse oximetry, but a resting saturation >95% does not exclude exerciserelated central cyanosis, and exercise assessment is essential. The
potential for a pulmonary cause of cyanosis must be considered and
lung function should be assessed as part of a cardiopulmonary exercise test. Even after surgical correction of the cardiac defect there
may be residual intracardiac shunting.
Stage 3. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
CPET is invaluable in risk stratifying the adult with CHD and can
predict outcome. [613,614] It is also extremely useful in the evaluation of
the athlete with CHD as it allows an assessment of PAP, respiratory
problems, cardiac output, exercise-related haemodynamics, and
arrhythmias. This should be used in conjunction with an evaluation of
effort such as the Borg scale. [615] Normal CPET values are available for
non-athlete CHD patients. [616] CPET should be carried out in conjunction with a 12-lead ECG to allow detection of arrhythmias and
evaluate chronotropic incompetence. Reduced VO 2max and peak
oxygen pulse may reflect reduced stroke volume and are found in
complex CHD as well as in other forms of CHD, including repaired
tetralogy of Fallot, aortic regurgitation, and coarctation of the aorta.
In CHD, ventilatory anaerobic threshold may be reduced and this
impairs gas exchange efficiency in dynamic and endurance sports.
This may relate to previous thoracotomy or lung disease. Similarly,
there may be an elevated minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO 2 ) slope, [601] indicating an inadequate pulmonary vascular bed. [610,611,613][�][616] Reduced skeletal muscle mass is common in

adults with CHD and can contribute to decreased tissue oxygen
uptake. The extent to which this is modified in athletes with CHD
has not been evaluated. However, even in complex disease, regular
resistance exercise participation improves muscle mass and regular
exercise participation is a dominant factor in determining long-term
outcome. [593,617]

Stage 4. Exercise intensity and prescription
An assessment of the athlete’s sports and exercise participation
should take place as discussed in the introduction (Table 16). This
should include an assessment of the intensity, aerobic and resistance
components (isometric and dynamic), and the overall volume of
exercise, which should include training and competition. The haemodynamic consequences should be considered in light of an understanding of known lesion-specific consequences and individual
athlete-specific changes identified on assessment.
Stage 5. Follow-up and repeat assessment

In the CHD athlete, serial assessment should be carried out—usu
ally on an annual basis—while participating in sport. This recognizes


the age-related changes that occur in the CHD athlete and the
potential for onset of degenerative CVD.

### 6. Key messages

CV screening before participation in recreational and competitive
sports is aimed at the detection of disorders associated with SCD
and has the potential to lower CV risk through disease-specific and
individualized patient management.
CV screening in adult and senior athletes should target the higher
prevalence of atherosclerotic CAD including an assessment of CVD
risk factors and exercise stress test. CAC scoring may be performed
in asymptomatic athletes with a moderate atherosclerotic risk
profile.
Healthy adults of all ages and individuals with known cardiac disease should exercise on most days, totalling at least 150 min/week of
moderate-intensity exercise.

Individuals with CAD, at low risk for exercise-induced adverse

events, should be considered eligible for competitive or leisure sports
activities, with few exceptions.
Competitive sports are not recommended in individuals with
CAD, at high risk of exercise-induced adverse events or those with
residual ischaemia, with the exception for individually low-intensity
skill sports.
Exercise programmes in HF improve exercise tolerance and quality of life and have a modest effect on all-cause and HF-specific mortality, and all-cause hospitalization and HF-specific hospitalization.

ESC Guidelines 73


Asymptomatic individuals with mild valvular heart disease may participate in all sporting activities including competitive sports.
A select group of asymptomatic individuals with moderate valve
disease who have good functional capacity and no evidence of myocardial ischaemia, complex arrhythmias, or haemodynamic compromise on a maximal exercise stress test may be considered for
competitive sports after careful discussion with an expert
cardiologist.
Implementation of healthy lifestyle behaviours including sports participation decreases the risk of CV events and mortality in individuals
with aortopathies.
Individuals with acute myocarditis or pericarditis should abstain
from all sports while active inflammation is present.
Individuals with cardiomyopathy or resolved myocarditis or pericarditis, who wish to participate in regular sports, should undergo
comprehensive evaluation, including an exercise test, to assess the
risk of exercise-induced arrhythmias.
Individuals who are genotype positive/phenotype negative or have
a mild cardiomyopathy phenotype and absence of symptoms or any
risk factors, may be able to participate in competitive sports. A notable exception is arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy where highintensity exercise and competitive sports should be discouraged.
Managing sports participation in individuals with arrhythmogenic
conditions is guided by three principles: (i) preventing life-threatening
arrhythmias during exercise; (ii) symptom management to allow
sports; and (iii) preventing sports-induced progression of the arrhythmogenic condition. In each case, these three basic questions need to

be addressed.

Pre-excitation should be excluded in all athletes with PSVT, and

ablation of the accessory pathway is recommended if present.
In individuals with PVCs who want to engage in sports, underlying
structural or familial arrhythmogenic conditions must be excluded,
since sports activity may trigger more malignant arrhythmias if those
underlying conditions are present.
Athletes with electrical abnormalities of genetic origin, such as the
inherited ion channelopathies, require assessment and shared decision making in which cardiogeneticists are involved, given the complex interplay of genotype, phenotype, potential modifiers, and

exercise.

Individuals with pacemakers should not be discouraged from participation in sport because of the device but need to tailor their
sports participation according to the underlying disease.
Participation in leisure-time and competitive sport in patients with
an ICD may be considered, but requires shared and individualized
decision making, based on a higher likelihood of appropriate and inappropriate shocks during sports, and the potential consequences of
short episodes of loss of consciousness.
Patients with CHD should be encouraged to exercise and should
be given a personalized exercise prescription.

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


Prospective outcomes data, including the occurrence of major CV
events and other CV morbidity, is needed to better guide risk stratification, management, and eligibility recommendations for athletes
diagnosed with CVD.

Cardiovascular evaluation in master athletes. Current

methods for screening individuals for atherosclerotic CAD are based
on symptoms and a maximal exercise test; however, they do not
identify individuals with mild to moderate atherosclerotic plaques.
More knowledge on the optimal pre-participation screening algorithm for identifying individuals at risk of adverse cardiac events during exercise is required.
Safety of high-intensity exercise in cardiovascular disease.
There are limited data on the safety of high-intensity exercise training
and sports participation in healthy individuals with a high burden of
risk factors; more information can be gained through high-quality
prospective studies in the future.
Risk of anomalous origins of the coronary arteries in
older individuals. Although AOCA from the opposite sinus of
Valsalva are a recognized cause of mortality in young athletes, more
knowledge is required on the risk of high-intensity exercise in older
individuals (>40 years old), with this congenital abnormality.
Risk of myocardial bridge. The precise significance of MB in
causing MI or sudden death during exercise is unknown.
Benefit of regular exercise on survival in chronic heart
failure. Although exercise improves functional capacity and quality
of life in individuals with HF, strong evidence on the benefit of regular
exercise on survival is still lacking.
Role of high-intensity exercise in chronic heart failure.
The impact of high-intensity exercise in asymptomatic individuals
with HF with reduced and preserved systolic function is unknown
and large multicentre studies are required to facilitate exercise prescription in the future.
Initiation of an exercise programme after decompensated heart failure. The start time of an exercise programme of
moderate-high intensity and return to sports after an acute event in

HF is unknown.

Aquatic exercise in heart failure. The safety of aquatic exercise in HF needs to be confirmed by larger trials.
Effect of exercise on the natural history of valvular heart
disease. There is a paucity data on the effects of regular intensive
exercise in individuals with valvular heart disease. Large-scale longitudinal studies are required to provide more evidence-based guidelines
on exercise prescription in individuals with valvular heart disease.
Effect of exercise on the natural history of aortopathies.
There is a lack of knowledge on the impact of sport on progression
of aortic disease and risk of dissection or aortic rupture among individuals with aortopathy. The impact of beta-blockers on progression
of aortic disease among individuals with aortopathy who participate
in regular exercise is unknown and should be investigated in a

randomized controlled trial.

Optimal safe exercise dose in cardiomyopathy. With an
exception for arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, current practice
relating to exercise recommendations in individuals with cardiomyopathy or following myopericarditis are largely based on circumstantial evidence. Large, adequately powered randomized prospective
studies are necessary to provide evidence-based recommendations
for optimal exercise prescription without compromising safety. Such

Exercise and atrial fibrillation. The threshold lifetime sports
activity for increasing the risk of developing AF is unknown. It is also
unknown whether ongoing participation in vigorous exercise at the
same intensity after successful AF ablation is associated with a higher

risk of AF recurrence.

Benefit of invasive electrophysiological studies in adolescents with accessory pathways. The benefit/risk ratio of early
invasive EP evaluation of AP conduction properties in young athletes

with asymptomatic pre-excitation (<12 14 years old), and prophylactic ablation, remains unclear and requires large-scale studies for

clarification.

Exercising with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.
Although an international registry has shown absence of sportsrelated sudden death or injury in individuals with an ICD who perform competitive, high-intensive recreational or high-risk sports,
many data are sparse and have not examined specific athletic populations with reduced LV function, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT.
Moreover, the long-term physical and psychological impact of appropriate and inappropriate shocks, which become more frequent with
increasing sports intensity, is unknown.
Arrhythmic risk of exercise in adult congenital heart disease. The relationship between intensity of exercise and risk of
arrhythmias in individuals with CHD is unknown and further research
is needed. Although exercise prescription is recommended in CHD
patients, further studies are necessary to identify the optimal method
of improving adherence to an exercise prescription.
### 8. Sex differences

For many years sports participation, especially at the highest echelons, has been dominated by males, but the last four decades have
witnessed an increasing number of females participating in a large
variety of sporting disciplines at elite level. Females constituted 45%
of all athletes at the 2016 Rio Olympics and participated in 26 of the
28 different sporting disciplines including those that were traditionally
considered to be ‘male sports’, such as footfall, rugby, and boxing.
Although the guidelines in this document are applicable to both
sexes, there are some pertinent sex-based differences relative to
exercise and sport including: (i) the incidence of SCD during exercise;
(ii) quantitative differences in CV adaptation to regular intensive
exercise and the overlap with cardiomyopathy; (iii) the predilection
of adverse events with specific CVDs in women; and (iv) the additive
haemodynamic effects of exercise in pregnant women with a structurally abnormal heart.
Current evidence suggests a significantly lower prevalence of
exercise-related SCD in females who represent a small minority of
athletes dying suddenly with a male to female ratio ranging from 3 to
10: 1. [17,18,46,49,52,620] This disproportionately lower incidence of SCD
among young competitive female athletes also holds true for older
recreational athletes where deaths in males are 20-fold greater than

in females.

Apart from a lower incidence of exercise-related SCD, there
appear to be sex differences related to the diseases predisposing to

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


HCM. In the US National Registry, females comprised only 3% of the
302 individuals who died from HCM. [621] Potential determinants of

this disproportionate prevalence of death in males may include a
lower absolute volume and intensity of training load in females, which
could make them less susceptible to ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
However, it is also plausible that certain protective metabolic or hormonal mechanisms could reduce the arrhythmic risk during intense
physical exertion in females with HCM. This observation is relevant
to prescription of intensive exercise or competitive sports in HCM,
which is relatively conservative, but could be of less concern and
more liberal in affected females in the future. The diagnosis of HCM
in an athlete is also relevant in this regard, because male athletes, particularly those competing in endurance sports, show quantitatively
great structural changes within the heart including LV hypertrophy.
Approximately 2% of white male athletes and 13% of black male athletes show a LV wall thickness of 12�15 mm that overlaps with morphologically mild HCM and can pose a diagnostic dilemma. In
contrast female athletes rarely reveal a LV wall thickness >12 mm or
concentric LV remodelling, hence the diagnosis of HCM is clear-cut. [3]

In contrast, a different scenario is represented in females with
MVP, where recommendation for participation in intensive exercise
warrants a more detailed risk stratification. In the Italian pathology
registry of 650 SCDs, 7% were attributed to MVP. Of these, the
majority (60%) were female who presented a marked elongation of
both leaflets due to an extensive myxomatous degeneration. [332]

It is also noteworthy that the majority of exercise-related SCDs in
young females are associated with a structurally normal heart at
autopsy. This observation from several registries suggests that genetic
electrical diseases (namely, LQTS, Brugada syndrome, or catecholaminergic polymorphic VT) are likely responsible for a significant proportion of these deaths. Differences in cardiac repolarization
between men and women have been reported in healthy subjects
and in individuals with LQTS. [622] Healthy females also have a longer
QTc interval compared with males. Therefore, they are more often
clinically affected by the syndrome than men, despite the equal sex
distribution of the disease genotype. Females are also at a higher risk
than males of developing arrhythmias in response to QT-prolonging
drugs, and electrolyte disturbances compared with males.
Furthermore, female sex is an independent risk factor for cardiac
events in LQTS. [623] Unfortunately, little is known about the influence
of sex hormones on cardiac repolarization, except that androgens
may shorten the QTc interval. Based on these considerations, we
recommend particular caution when advising competitive sports in
women with a probable or definite diagnosis of LQTS.
Pregnancy is associated with a 50% increase in plasma volume and
cardiac output. The stresses of exercise in pregnant women with
structural heart disease have the potential to cause haemodynamic
compromise. Moderate aerobic exercise is generally safe in all
women and is associated with a lower prevalence of excessive weight
gain, post-partum obesity, gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia.
Female athletes may continue training intensively during pregnancy,
although it is recommended that women do not exceed a heart
rate of >90% of the maximum predicted for age to reduce the risk
of foetal bradycardia. Pregnant women with known structural heart
disease require evaluation before embarking on intensive exercise
programmes. Exercise or sports involving forceful physical contact,
risk of falling or abdominal trauma, heavy lifting, scuba diving, and
