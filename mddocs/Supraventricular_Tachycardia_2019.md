responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient
and caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other societies and organisations. Because of their impact on clinical practice,
quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be
[found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)

[ing-ESC-Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official posi-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
tion of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.

The ESC carries out a number of registries which are essential to
assess, diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources and adherence to Guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world, based
on data collected during routine clinical practice.
The guidelines are developed together with derivative educational
material addressing the cultural and professional needs for cardiologists and allied professionals. Collecting high-quality observational
data, at appropriate time interval following the release of ESC
Guidelines, will help evaluate the level of implementation of the
Guidelines, checking in priority the key end points defined with the

ESC Guidelines and Education Committees and Task Force members

in charge.
The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in
order to represent professionals involved with the medical care of
patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a
comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of
a given condition according to ESC Committee for Practice
Guidelines (CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the
risk�benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and
graded according to predefined ESC scales, as outlined in tables 1 and

2 below.

The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. These forms were
[compiled into one file and can be found on the ESC website (http://](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[www.escardio.org/guidelines). Any changes in declarations of interest](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC and
updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from
the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.

The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
Guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement
process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive
review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions
the Guidelines are approved by all the experts involved in the Task
Force. The finalized document is approved by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The Guidelines were developed
after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge
and the evidence available at the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation
of educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary

### 1 Preamble

(smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus, for more
detailed information, the user should always access to the full

Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in
the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic
or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines do
not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of
health professionals to make appropriate and accurate decisions in
consideration of each patient’s health condition and in consultation

with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or
necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify
the rules and regulations applicable in each country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.
### 2 Introduction
. [.......................]

Supraventricular arrhythmias are common and patients are often
symptomatic, requiring management with drugs and electrophysiological procedures. The ESC published management Guidelines for
supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) in 2003 [1] ; corresponding US
guidelines have also been published, the most recent being in 2015. [2]

There is a need to provide expert recommendations for professionals participating in the care of patients presenting with SVT. In addition, several associated conditions where SVTs may coexist need to
be explained in more detail. To address this topic, a Task Force was
convened by the ESC, with the remit to comprehensively review the
published evidence and to publish Guidelines on the management of
patients with SVT, with up-to-date consensus recommendations for
clinical practice. This document summarizes current developments in

the field, with a focus on advances since the last ESC Guidelines were

published, and provides general recommendations for the management of adults with SVT based on the principles of evidence-based

medicine.

2.1 Evidence review

Members of the Task Force were asked to perform a detailed literature review, weigh the strength of evidence for or against a particular
treatment or procedure, and include estimates of expected health
outcomes where data exist. Patient-specific modifiers, comorbidities,
and issues of patient preference that might influence the choice of
particular tests or therapies were considered, as were frequency of
follow-up and cost-effectiveness. In controversial areas, or with
regard to issues without evidence other than usual clinical practice,
consensus was achieved by agreement of the expert panel after thorough deliberation. The document was peer-reviewed by official

external reviewers.

The strengths of the recommendations and levels of evidence of
particular management options were weighed and graded according
to predefined scales, as outlined above in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

Overall, these Guidelines include evidence and expert opinions
from several countries. The pharmacological and nonpharmacological antiarrhythmic approaches discussed may therefore
include drugs that do not have the approval of governmental regulatory agencies in all countries.

2.2 Relationships with industry and other
conflicts of interest

It is ESC policy to sponsor position papers and Guidelines without
commercial support, and all members volunteered their time. Thus,
all members of the writing group, as well as the reviewers, have disclosed any potential conflicts of interest in detail. The details of these
declarations will be posted on the ESC website upon publication of

these Guidelines.


2.3 What is new in the 2019 Guidelines?

2.3.1 Change in recommendations from 2003 to 2019
Owing to the fact that the previous Guidelines on SVT were published 16 years ago, many drugs that were recommended at that time
are not considered in the 2019 Guidelines. In addition, techniques
and indications of ablation techniques have changed. These recommendation changes are indicated for each section in Table 3 below.

essence, a supraventricular rhythm (Table 5). The term ‘narrow QRS
tachycardia’ indicates those with a QRS duration <_120 ms. A wide
QRS tachycardia refers to one with a QRS duration >120 ms
(Table 6). In clinical practice, SVT may present as narrow or wide QRS
tachycardias, most of which, although not invariably, manifest as regular rhythms. These Guidelines do not cover AF, which is the subject of
separate clinical Guidelines [4] and various consensus documents. [5][�][7]
### 4 Electrophysiological mechanisms of supraventricular tachycardia

Arrhythmia can originate from abnormal impulse initiation in an individual myocyte or, more realistically, in a close cluster of myocytes. This
can occur in non-pacemaker cells through a mechanism similar to the
physiological automaticity of pacemaker cells [sinus node and AV node
(AVN)], and is thus named ‘abnormal’ or ‘enhanced automaticity’. An
alternative form of abnormal impulse initiation involves oscillations of

membrane potential, named early or delayed ‘after-depolarizations’. In
such cases, the resulting arrhythmias take the name of ‘triggered activity’. [8] Arrhythmias resulting from enhanced automaticity and triggered
activity are defined as ‘non-re-entrant’. Arrhythmias can also arise
when myocardial regions activated later in propagation re-excite
regions that have already recovered excitability. This results from
abnormal propagation of the excitation wavefront and/or of tissue
refractoriness. This mechanism, named ‘re-entry’, is based on the syncytial nature of myocardial tissue and is thus radically different from
focal impulse initiation. [8] A detailed discussion and schematic represen[tation of common SVT circuits is provided in the Supplementary Data.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehz467#supplementary-data)

### 6 Epidemiology of supraventricular tachycardia

Epidemiological studies on the SVT population are limited. In the general population, the SVT prevalence is 2.25/1000 persons and the
incidence is 35/100000 person-years. Women have a risk of developing SVT that is two times greater than that of men, and persons aged
>_65 years or have more than five times the risk of developing SVT
than younger individuals. Patients with lone paroxysmal SVT vs. those
with cardiovascular disease are younger, have a faster SVT rate, have
an earlier onset of symptoms, and are more likely to have their condition first documented in the emergency department. [9] In a paediatric

�
cohort study of 1 967 911 live births between 2000 08, 2021
patients (51.6% male, overall incidence 1.03/1000) had SVT

[Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome accounted for 16.2%].
By the age of 15 years, the annual risk of sudden death was 0.01% per
patient-year. [10]

In specialized centres, AVNRT is the most frequently treated substrate after AF, followed by atrial flutter and AVRT, in patients
referred for catheter ablation. [11][�][13] Women are more likely to be
affected by AVNRT than men (ratio �70:30), [14][�][16] while the converse is true for AVRT (ratio 45:55). [14] A relationship with the
monthly cycle has been suggested, [17] and episodes are more frequent
during pregnancy in women with pre-existing SVT. [18]

In the general population, the prevalence of a WPW pattern on

. [...........................................................................................................]


various questionnaires are useful in the audit of ablation techniques.
Women are more often prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs before ablation for SVT than men, [28] and recurrence rates following AVNRT
ablation are higher in young women. [29] However, overall, no significant differences in health-related quality of life or access to healthcare
resources between men and women have been reported. [28]
### 7 Clinical presentation

The impact of SVT on an individual is based on a range of factors and
may result in palpitations, fatigue, light-headedness, chest discomfort,
dyspnoea, and altered consciousness. [30] Rapid rhythms are more
likely to present with a clear history and acutely than less-rapid
rhythms, but SVT usually produces symptoms. [31] The duration of
symptoms and the patient’s age at onset are important. An individual
with an onset in the teenage years or younger is less likely to have AT
or AF continuing into adulthood. Such a long history will point
towards a re-entrant mechanism. [32] Dyspnoea, or other clinical signs
and symptoms of HF, can occur when the patient has developed
TCM. Light-headedness in association with SVT is not infrequent. [30]

Presyncope and syncope are less common, [33][,][34] and tend to be associated with presentation in older individuals. [32] In older patients,
symptoms may be more extreme—with dizziness, presyncope, and
syncope—in view of the less-accommodating characteristics of the
circulation; drops in blood pressure are usually immediate and tend
to recover. [35] In some patients, a description of polyuria (possibly due
to atrial stretch-induced atrial natriuretic peptide activity) can be elucidated, although this is infrequent. [36] Direct risks due to SVT are
unusual, but in specific situations (e.g. in patients with WPW syndrome and AF, [22] or after atrial switch operation [37] ) may lead to sud
den cardiac death.

A sudden onset more likely points to AVNRT or AVRT, although
an AT may also present in this way. [32] Characteristics in terms of the
regularity or irregularity are helpful. The duration of individual episodes may help in terms of differentiation. Re-entrant tachycardias

By the age of 15 years, the annual risk of sudden death was 0.01% per
patient-year. [10]

In specialized centres, AVNRT is the most frequently treated substrate after AF, followed by atrial flutter and AVRT, in patients
referred for catheter ablation. [11][�][13] Women are more likely to be
affected by AVNRT than men (ratio �70:30), [14][�][16] while the converse is true for AVRT (ratio 45:55). [14] A relationship with the
monthly cycle has been suggested, [17] and episodes are more frequent
during pregnancy in women with pre-existing SVT. [18]

In the general population, the prevalence of a WPW pattern on
surface electrocardiogram (ECG) ranges from 0.15�0.25%, [19]

increasing to 0.55% among first-degree relatives of affected
patients. [20] However, not all patients develop SVT and
intermittent pre-excitation is not rare. Compared with the remaining
population, the pre-excitation population is generally younger, predominantly male, and has less comorbidity. [21][,][22] The proportion of
patients with AVRT decreases with age, whereas the proportion of
those with AVNRT and AT increases with age. [14]

The epidemiology of atrial flutter is not known with certainty, as
atrial flutter and AF can coexist. The prevalence of AF before flutter
ablation ranges from 24�62%, and after ablation could be 30�70%.
The overall incidence of atrial flutter is 88/100 000 person-years in
the US population annually. Adjusted for age, the incidence of atrial
flutter in men (125/100 000) is >2.5 times that of women (59/
100 000) and increases exponentially with age. Patients with atrial
flutter are more likely to have been smokers, have a longer PR interval, history of myocardial infarction (MI), and history of heart failure
(HF). [23]

Catheter ablation is now used extensively for most varieties of
SVT, and patient-reported outcome measures have shown that
patients experience significant improvements in their quality of life
following ablation. [24][�][27] Patient-reported outcome measures using

ESC Guidelines 665


tend to last longer than AT episodes, which may occur in a series of
repetitive runs. [32] Clear descriptions of pounding in the neck (the socalled ‘frog sign’) or ‘shirt flapping’ would point to the possible competing influences of atrial and ventricular contraction on the tricuspid
valve, and to AVNRT as a likely cause. [15][,][38][,][39]

SVT may be unrecognized at initial medical evaluation and the clinical characteristics can mimic panic disorder. [40] In patients with possible sinus tachycardia in association with anxiety and postural
orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), it is important to rule out
the possibility of a re-entrant tachycardia.
### 8 Initial evaluation of patients with supraventricular tachycardia

Complete history taking, including family history, and physical examination are essential. As discussed, clinical history is especially relevant
in cases of palpitations without ECG documentation of the tachycardia. Initial evaluation points to a re-entrant arrhythmia when the

mode of onset/termination is sudden, is often associated with a

change of position, and the tachycardia is perceived as regular.
Initiation of the episode(s), frequency, and conditions of triggering
the arrhythmia are important clues for a specific diagnosis. [3] There
may be evidence that specific actions lead to arrhythmia termination.
These could include standard vagal manoeuvres, [41] but also abortive
measures such as drinking a glass of iced water. Also, responses to
the administration of drugs (e.g. adenosine or verapamil), where termination has been observed but ECGs are missing, may provide diagnostic help.

Full blood counts and a biochemistry profile—including renal function, electrolytes, and thyroid function tests—can be useful in specific
cases (Table 7). An ECG recorded during tachycardia is ideal, and
patients should be encouraged to seek medical assistance and
recording of their ECG during episodes. A 12 lead resting ECG and
baseline echocardiographic assessment are necessary. It may be useful to do 24 h ECG recordings, but tachycardia episodes are usually
sporadic and may not be frequent enough to be recorded on ambulatory monitoring. Transtelephonic monitoring, mobile recording devices, or, very rarely, an implantable loop recorder may be required.
Wrist-worn, optically based heart rate monitors are user-friendly,
but appropriate validation of the device used is imperative. [42] A tolerance exercise test may also be useful in patients with apparent preexcitation and in cases of catecholamine-dependent arrhythmias.
Myocardial ischaemia testing is also needed in patients with angina or
significant risk factors for coronary artery disease. [43] An electrophysiology study (EPS) is usually necessary to establish the diagnosis, particularly when catheter ablation is anticipated.
### 9 Differential diagnosis of tachycardias

9.1 Narrow QRS (�120 ms) tachycardias
Narrow QRS complexes are due to rapid activation of the ventricles
via the His�Purkinje system (HPS), which suggests that the origin of

. [............................................................................................................................................................................]


activation of the His bundle can also occur in high septal VTs, thus

�
resulting in relatively narrow QRS complexes (110 140 ms). [44]

9.1.1 Electrocardiographic differential diagnosis
In the absence of an ECG recorded during the tachycardia, a 12 lead
ECG in sinus rhythm may provide clues for the diagnosis of SVT and
should be scrutinized for any abnormality. The presence of preexcitation in a patient with a history of regular paroxysmal palpitations is
generally suggestive of AVRT. The absence of apparent pre-excitation
does not rule out the diagnosis of AVRT, as it may be due to a concealed accessory pathway (AP) that conducts only retrogradely or to
an atypical (Mahaim) pathway, which is latent at sinus rhythm.
An ECG taken during tachycardia is very useful in the efficient diagnosis of SVT, although it may fail to lead to a specific diagnosis. [45] It
may not be available in patients with very short or infrequent periods
of palpitations.

9.1.1.1 Initiation and termination of the tachycardia
Sudden prolongation of the PR interval occurs in typical AVNRT after
an atrial ectopic beat. An AT may also be initiated by an atrial ectopic
beat, but is not dependent on marked PR prolongation. Automatic,
focal ATs are characterized by gradual acceleration (warm-up phenomenon) followed by deceleration (cool-down phenomenon), [46]

and may also be incessant with short interruption by sinus beats.
Premature atrial or ventricular beats may trigger AVRT. Premature
ventricular complexes are a common trigger of atypical AVNRT, but
rarely induce typical AVNRT, and only exceptionally AT.

9.1.1.2 Regularity of tachycardia cycle length
The regularity of the RR interval should be assessed (Figure 1).
Irregular tachycardias may represent focal or multifocal AT, focal AF,
and atrial flutter with varying AV conduction. Patterns of irregularity

can sometimes be found, such as in atrial flutter conducted with

Wenckebach periodicity. Irregular arrhythmias, such as multifocal
AT, typically display variable P-wave morphologies, and varying PP,

RR, and PR intervals. Atrial flutter can have fixed AV conduction and

present as a regular tachycardia, and even AF may appear almost regular when very fast. Re-entrant tachycardias, whether micro� or
macro-re-entries, are usually regular. Incessant tachycardias may be
the so-called permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT),
focal AT, or, rarely, atypical AVNRT. Cycle length (CL) alternans
(also called RR alternans) may be seen in AVNRT, but these changes
are <15% of the tachycardia CL. [47] If the irregularity exceeds 15% of
the CL, a focal arrhythmia is much more likely. [48] QRS alternans is a
rare phenomenon in slow SVTs, which may not be related to CL
alternans, and has been initially described with AVRT. [49][,][50] However,
this may be seen in any fast SVT. [51]

A change in ventricular CL preceded by a change in atrial CL is
seen in AT or atypical AVNRT. A change in ventricular CL preceding
a change in subsequent atrial CL favours typical AVNRT or
AVRT. [47][,][52] A fixed ventriculoatrial (VA) interval in the presence of
variable RR intervals excludes AT. [45]

9.1.1.3 P/QRS relationship
According to their P/QRS relationships, SVTs are classified as having
short or long RP intervals. Short-RP SVTs are those with RP intervals


SVT may be unrecognized at initial medical evaluation and the clinical characteristics can mimic panic disorder. [40] In patients with possible sinus tachycardia in association with anxiety and postural
orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), it is important to rule out
the possibility of a re-entrant tachycardia.

### 8 Initial evaluation of patients with supraventricular tachycardia


Complete history taking, including family history, and physical examination are essential. As discussed, clinical history is especially relevant
in cases of palpitations without ECG documentation of the tachycardia. Initial evaluation points to a re-entrant arrhythmia when the

mode of onset/termination is sudden, is often associated with a

change of position, and the tachycardia is perceived as regular.
Initiation of the episode(s), frequency, and conditions of triggering
the arrhythmia are important clues for a specific diagnosis. [3] There
may be evidence that specific actions lead to arrhythmia termination.
These could include standard vagal manoeuvres, [41] but also abortive
measures such as drinking a glass of iced water. Also, responses to
the administration of drugs (e.g. adenosine or verapamil), where termination has been observed but ECGs are missing, may provide diagnostic help.

Full blood counts and a biochemistry profile—including renal function, electrolytes, and thyroid function tests—can be useful in specific
cases (Table 7). An ECG recorded during tachycardia is ideal, and
patients should be encouraged to seek medical assistance and
recording of their ECG during episodes. A 12 lead resting ECG and
baseline echocardiographic assessment are necessary. It may be useful to do 24 h ECG recordings, but tachycardia episodes are usually
sporadic and may not be frequent enough to be recorded on ambulatory monitoring. Transtelephonic monitoring, mobile recording devices, or, very rarely, an implantable loop recorder may be required.
Wrist-worn, optically based heart rate monitors are user-friendly,
but appropriate validation of the device used is imperative. [42] A tolerance exercise test may also be useful in patients with apparent preexcitation and in cases of catecholamine-dependent arrhythmias.
Myocardial ischaemia testing is also needed in patients with angina or
significant risk factors for coronary artery disease. [43] An electrophysiology study (EPS) is usually necessary to establish the diagnosis, particularly when catheter ablation is anticipated.

### 9 Differential diagnosis of tachycardias


9.1 Narrow QRS (�120 ms) tachycardias
Narrow QRS complexes are due to rapid activation of the ventricles
via the His�Purkinje system (HPS), which suggests that the origin of
the arrhythmia is above or within the His bundle. However, early

666 ESC Guidelines















Figure 1 Differential diagnosis of narrow QRS tachycardia. Recording of a retrograde P wave should be sought by obtaining a 12 lead
Electrocardiogram and, if necessary, using the Lewis leads or even an oesophageal lead connected to a pre-cordial lead (V1) with use of alligator clamps.
The 90 ms cut-off is a rather arbitrary number used for surface electrocardiogram measurements if P waves are visible and is based on limited data. In the
electrophysiology laboratory, the cut-off of the ventriculoatrial interval is 70 ms. Junctional ectopic tachycardia may also present with atrioventricular dis
sociation.

ESC Guidelines 667


shorter than one-half the tachycardia RR interval, whereas long-RP
SVTs display RP>_PR (Figure 1). Rarely, recording of U waves during
typical AVNRT may simulate a long-RP tachycardia. [53]

On EPS, a very short VA interval (<_70 ms) usually indicates typical
AVNRT, or less commonly focal AT, but has also been reported in . [..............]
AVRT. [54] For surface ECG measurements, a cut-off interval of 90 ms
has been shown to be useful and can be used if P waves are visible, [55]

but data on actual RP measurements during various types of SVT are

scarce.

P waves similar to those in normal sinus rhythm suggest appropriate or inappropriate sinus nodal tachycardia, sinus nodal re-entrant
tachycardia, or focal AT arising close to the sinus node. P waves different from those in sinus rhythm, and conducted with a PR interval
equal to or longer than the PR in sinus rhythm, are typically seen in
focal AT. In AT, the conduction to the ventricles may be fast (1:1) or
slow (3:1 or 4:1). The possibility of atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction
should also be considered if the ventricular rate during SVT is �150
b.p.m., as the atrial activity is usually 250 - 330 b.p.m. In the presence
of antiarrhythmic medication in this setting, lowering the atrial rate
may result in a higher ventricular rate in the absence of AV nodal

blockade.

In the case of relatively delayed retrograde conduction that allows
the identification of retrograde P waves, a pseudo r deflection in lead
V1 and a pseudo S wave in the inferior leads are more common in
typical AVNRT than in AVRT or AT. [56][,][57] These criteria are specific
(91�100%) but modestly sensitive (58 and 14%, respectively). [56] A

difference in RP intervals in leads V1 and III >20 ms is also indicative
of AVNRT rather than AVRT due to a posteroseptal pathway. [57] The
presence of a QRS notch in lead aVL has also been found to be a reliable criterion suggesting AVNRT, [58] while a pseudo r in aVR has been
shown to have greater sensitivity and specificity than a pseudo r in V1
for the diagnosis of typical AVNRT. [59] However, in all referenced
studies, cases of AT or atypical AVNRT were limited or entirely

absent.

AV block or dissociation during narrow QRS tachycardia is not

often seen, but it rules out AVRT as both atria and ventricles are

parts of the circuit. The development of bundle branch block (BBB)
during SVT may also be helpful in the diagnosis of AVRT. BBB ipsilateral to the AP can result in CL prolongation due to VA prolongation,
as the ventricular arm of the circuit is prolonged by conduction
through the interventricular septum from the conducting bundle
branch. [60] However, it should be noted that lengthening of the VA
interval may not necessarily result in CL prolongation, due to a
potential switch of antegrade conduction from the slow to the fast
AV nodal pathway.

9.1.2 Vagal manoeuvres and adenosine
Vagal manoeuvres (such as carotid sinus massage) and adenosine
injection may help in clinical diagnosis, particularly in situations in
which the ECG during tachycardia is unclear. Possible responses to
vagal manoeuvres and adenosine are shown in Table 8 and Figure 2.
Termination of the arrhythmia with a P wave after the last QRS
complex is very unlikely in AT, and most common in AVRT and typical AVNRT. Termination with a QRS complex is often seen in AT,
and possibly in atypical AVNRT. Adenosine does not interrupt macro-re-entrant ATs (MRATs). [61] Fascicular VTs, in particular, are


verapamil- but not adenosine-sensitive. Most VTs, as opposed to
SVTs, do not respond to carotid sinus massage, but a narrow QRS
VT originating at the left bundle branch and terminated with carotid
sinus massage has been reported. [62]

to vagal manoeuvres and adenosine

(1) Slowing of AVN conduction and induction of intermittent AV block.

Atrial electrical activity can thus be unmasked, revealing dissociated P

waves (focal AT, atrial flutter, or AF waves).

(2) Temporary decrease in the atrial rate of automatic tachycardias (focal

AT, sinus tachycardia, and JET).

(3) Tachycardia termination. This can happen by interrupting the re-entry

circuit in AVNRT and AVRT by acting on the AVN that is part of the

circuit. More rarely, sinus nodal re-entry and ATs due to triggered

activity can slow down and terminate.

(4) No effect is observed in some cases.

9.1.3 Electrophysiology study
Several electrophysiological techniques and manoeuvres can be
employed in the electrophysiology laboratory for differential diagnosis of regular narrow QRS tachycardia. [45] A detailed discussion is
beyond the scope of these Guidelines.

9.2 Wide QRS (>120 ms) tachycardias
Wide QRS tachycardias can be VT, SVT conducting with BBB aberration, or antegrade conduction over an AP, with reported proportions
of 80, 15, and 5%, respectively. [63] The correct diagnosis of a VT is critical to management, as misdiagnosis and administration of drugs usually utilized for SVT can be harmful for patients in VT. [64] Therefore,
the default diagnosis should be VT until proven otherwise. The
differential diagnosis includes: [65]

(1) SVT with BBB. This may arise due to pre-existing BBB or the devel
opment of aberrancy during tachycardia (so-called phase 3 block),

which is more commonly, although not invariably, a right BBB

(RBBB) pattern due to the longer RP of the right bundle branch.

(2) SVT with antegrade conduction over an AP, ‘pre-excited SVT’,

which participates in the circuit (antidromic AVRT) or is a bystander

during AF, focal AT/atrial flutter, or AVNRT.

(3) SVT with widening of QRS interval induced by drugs or electrolyte

disturbances. Class IA and IC drugs cause use-dependent slowing of

conduction, and class III drugs prolong refractoriness at

His�Purkinje tissue more than in the ventricular myocardium. They

can both result in atypical BBB morphologies during SVT that

mimics VT.

(4) Pacemaker-related endless loop tachycardia and artefacts, which

can also mimic VT.

9.2.1 Electrocardiographic differential diagnosis
If the 12 lead ECG is available in sinus rhythm, it can provide useful
diagnostic information. Specifically, if the QRS morphology is identical
during sinus rhythm and tachycardia, the arrhythmia is most likely not
a VT. However, bundle branch re-entrant VTs and high septal VTs
exiting close to the conduction system can have similar morphologies
to sinus rhythm. The presence of a contralateral BBB pattern in sinus
rhythm is more indicative of VT.

9.2.1.1 Atrioventricular dissociation

The presence of either AV dissociation or capture/fusion beats in the
12 lead ECG during tachycardia are key diagnostic features of VT. AV
dissociation may be difficult to recognize because P waves are often
hidden by wide QRS and T waves during a wide QRS tachycardia. P
waves are usually more prominent in inferior leads and in modified
chest lead placement (Lewis lead). [63]

The relationship between atrial and ventricular events is 1:1 or
greater (more atrial than ventricular beats) in most SVTs (Table 9).
AVNRT can be associated with 2:1 conduction, [66] but this is rare.

Although VA conduction can be found in <_50% of patients with VT
and a 1:1 relationship is possible, most VTs have a relationship <1:1
(more QRS complexes than P waves).

a RS: beginning of R to deepest part of S.

9.2.1.2 QRS duration

A QRS duration >140 ms with RBBB or >160 ms with left BBB

(LBBB) pattern suggests VT. These criteria are not helpful for differentiating VT from SVT in specific settings, such as pre-excited SVT,
or when class IC or class IA antiarrhythmic drugs are administered. [67]

9.2.1.3 QRS axis
As VT circuits (especially post-MI or in cardiomyopathies) frequently
lie outside the normal His�Purkinje network, significant axis shifts
are likely to occur, enabling diagnosis. Therefore, in patients with SVT
and aberrancy, the QRS axis is confined between -60 and þ120 [�] . In
particular, extreme axis deviation (axis from -90 to ±180 [�] ) is strongly
indicative of VT, both in the presence of RBBB and LBBB. [65]

9.2.1.4 Chest lead concordance

The presence of negative chest lead concordance (all QRS complexes negative V1�V6) (Figure 3) is almost diagnostic of VT, with a
specificity >90%, but is only present in 20% of VTs. Positive concordance can be indicative of VT or an antidromic tachycardia utilizing a
left posterior or left lateral AP. [68]

ESC Guidelines 669

concordance concordance

AVRT = atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia; VT = ventricular tachycardia.


9.2.1.5 Right bundle branch block morphology
Lead V1: Typical RBBB aberrancy has a small initial r’, because in
RBBB the high septum is activated primarily from the left septal bundle. Therefore, the following patterns are evident: rSR [0], rSr [0], or rR [0] in
lead V1. However, in VT, the activation wavefront progresses from
the left ventricle (LV) to the right precordial lead V1, in a way that a
prominent R wave (monophasic R, Rsr [0], biphasic qR complex, or
broad R >40 ms) will be more commonly seen in lead V1.
Additionally, a double-peaked R wave (M pattern) in lead V1 favours
VT if the left peak is taller than the right peak (the so-called ‘rabbit
ear’ sign). A taller right rabbit ear characterizes the RBBB aberrancy

but does not exclude VT.

Lead V6: A small amount of normal right ventricular voltage is
directed away from lead V6. As this is a small vector in RBBB aberrancy, the R:S ratio is >1. In VT, all of the right ventricular voltage, and
some of the left, is directed away from V6, leading to an R:S ratio <1
(rS and QS patterns). An RBBB morphology with an R:S ratio in V6 of
<1 is seen rarely in SVT with aberrancy, mainly when the patient has
a left axis deviation during sinus rhythm.
Differentiating fascicular VT from SVT with bifascicular block
(RBBB and left anterior hemiblock) is very challenging. Features that
indicate SVT in this context include QRS >140 ms, overall negative
QRS in aVR, and an R/S ratio >1 in V6. [44]

9.2.1.6 Left bundle branch block morphology

Lead V1: As stated above for RBBB, for the same reasons, the
presence of a broad R wave, slurred or notched-down stroke of . [.................................................................................]


the S wave, and delayed nadir of the S wave are strong predictors

of VT.

Lead V6: In true LBBB, no Q wave is present in the lateral precordial leads. Therefore, the presence of any Q or QS wave in lead V6
favours VT, indicating that the activation wavefront is moving away
from the LV apical site.
These morphology criteria are not fulfilled in any lead in 4% of
SVTs and 6% of VTs, and in one-third of cases when one lead (V1 or
V6) favours one diagnosis, the other favours the opposite diagnosis
(VT in one lead and SVT in the other, and vice versa). [69][,][70]

A number of algorithms have been developed to differentiate
VT from SVT. [69][,][71][,][72] Detailed presentation and comments are
beyond the scope of these Guidelines, and can be found in the
2018 European Heart Rhythm Association/Heart Rhythm
Society/Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society/Sociedad
Latinoamericana de Estimulacion Card� �ıaca y Electrofisiolog�ıa
consensus document. [3]

All of these criteria have limitations. Conditions such as bundle

branch re-entrant tachycardia, fascicular VT, VT with exit site close
to the His�Purkinje system, and wide QRS tachycardia occurring
during antiarrhythmic drug treatment are difficult to diagnose using
the mentioned morphological criteria. Differentiating VT from antidromic AVRT is extremely difficult for the very fact that the QRS
morphology in antidromic AVRT is similar to that of a VT, with its origin at the insertion of the AP in the ventricular myocardium. An algorithm has been derived for differential diagnosis, based on the analysis
of 267 wide QRS tachycardias, consisting of VT and antidromic

670 ESC Guidelines


AVRT. The derived criteria were found to offer sensitivity of 75% and
specificity of 100%, [73] and the algorithm was also validated in another
study, [74] but experience is still limited.

In fact, several independent studies have found that various ECGbased methods have specificities of 40�80% and accuracies of
�75%. [44][,][68][,][75][�][80] Indeed, a similar diagnostic accuracy of �75% would
be achieved effortlessly by considering every wide QRS tachycardia

�
to be a VT, because only 25 30% are SVTs. Therefore, emerging
approaches to integrate these algorithms and provide more accurate
scoring systems are being evaluated. [81] Furthermore, conventional
ECG criteria have reduced the sensitivity to distinguish VT from SVT
with aberrancy in patients with idiopathic VT. This is most pronounced in VTs originating from septal sites, particularly Purkinje sites
and the septal outflow tract regions. [82]

9.2.2 Electrophysiology study
On certain occasions, an EPS is necessary for diagnosis.

9.3 Irregular tachycardias
An irregular ventricular rhythm most commonly indicates AF, multi
focal AT, or focal AT/atrial flutter with variable AV conduction, and

may occur in the context of both narrow and broad QRS complexes.
When AF is associated with rapid ventricular rates, the irregularity of
this ventricular response is less easily detected and can be misdiagnosed as a regular SVT. [83] If the atrial rate exceeds the ventricular
rate, then atrial flutter or AT (focal or multifocal) is usually present.
Polymorphic VT and, rarely, monomorphic VT may also be irregular.
Occasionally, a junctional, non-re-entrant tachycardia may have a var
iable rate.

Specifically, the differential diagnosis of an irregular wide QRS
tachycardia is either pre-excited AF or polymorphic VT, or AT
with variable block in the context of aberrancy. Pre-excited AF
manifests itself by irregularity, a varying QRS morphology, and a
rapid ventricular rate (owing to the short RP of the AP). The
changing QRS morphology results from varying degrees of fusion

due to activation over both the AP and the AVN, which also result

in variation in the width of the delta wave. A further cause of varying QRS morphology in this context will be if more than one antegrade AP is present with intermittent conduction over each. The
ventricular rate tends to be higher than in those with non-preexcited AF. [84]
### 10 Acute management in the absence of an established diagnosis

10.1 Regular tachycardias
10.1.1 Narrow QRS (�120 ms) tachycardias
Patients with SVT are common and potentially recurrent attenders
in emergency departments, with an estimated 50 000 visits each
year in the USA. [85] The initial approach to acute management tends
to be non-drug-based, with escalation to intravenous (i.v.) drugs
or electrical cardioversion in the absence of early correction
(Figure 4).

10.1.1.1 Haemodynamically unstable patients
Immediate direct-current (DC) cardioversion is the first choice in
haemodynamically compromised patients with narrow QRS
tachycardia. [86][�][88][,][101]

10.1.1.2 Haemodynamically stable patients
Vagal manoeuvres can be used to terminate an episode of narrow
QRS SVT. [41] The effectiveness of conventional vagal manoeuvres in
terminating SVT, when correctly performed, has been reported as
between 19 and 54%. [41][,][89][�][91,102][,][103] Vagal manoeuvres include different techniques used to stimulate the receptors in the internal carotid
arteries. This stimulation causes a reflex stimulation of the vagus
nerve, which results in the release of acetylcholine, which may in turn
slow the electrical impulse through the AVN and slow the heart rate.
Many of these manoeuvres can be performed with minimal risk at the
bedside or in an office setting, and can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. The Valsalva manoeuvre is a safe and internationally recommended first-line emergency treatment for SVT, although a recent
Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support or refute its
utility. [89] The Valsalva manoeuvre has generally been shown to be

most effective in adults, and in AVRT rather than AVNRT. A modified

than smaller distal veins. [108] Dosing should then be incremental, starting at 6 mg in adults followed by 12 mg. An 18 mg dose should then
be considered, also taking into account tolerability/side effects in the
individual patient. Adenosine has a very short plasma half-life due to
enzymatic deamination to inactive inosine being achieved in seconds,
with end-organ clinical effects complete within 20�30 s. [107] Thus,
repeat administration is safe within 1 min of the last dose. [2,3] The dose
range between patients may be very wide, [107] with >90% success generally expected. [94][,][109] Some drugs (e.g. dipyridamole and theophylline) may on occasion affect dose requirements, but any influence of
recent intake of caffeinated beverages is disputed. [110][,][111]

Transient dyspnoea is common with increased ventilation, and is
more likely to result from the stimulation of pulmonary vagal C
fibres. [112] Facial flushing may occur, associated with vasodilatation and
increased skin temperature. [107] Chest pain, variable in terms of radiation over the thorax, may suggest ischaemic or oesophageal origins,
and has been associated with increased coronary sinus blood flow so
may well be of cardiac origin. [107]

Depression of sinoatrial node function is to be expected based on
established pharmacology, but prolonged bradycardia is
unusual. [105][,][107] Nonetheless, adenosine administration should be
approached cautiously in those with known sinus node disease. [113]

Perceived risks of bradycardia in recipients of denervated orthotropic
heart transplants, in whom SVT is common, have prompted a relative
contraindication. [114][,][115] However, more recent substantive evidence
supports adenosine use in this group with no particular cautions. [116]

AF may occur following adenosine administration as a result of either
direct pulmonary vein (PV) triggering [117] or increasing heterogeneity
of repolarization, [118] and appears more commonly associated with
AVRT than AVNRT. [93] Adenosine may also occasionally cause or
accelerate pre-excited atrial arrhythmias. [119][,][120]

Clinically important bronchoconstriction has been rarely reported
in those receiving i.v. adenosine for SVT, [121] and this observation is
further supported by the large experience obtained when adenosine
infusions have been given for cardiac stress testing. [105][,][122][,][123]

Furthermore, despite inhaled adenosine producing bronchoconstriction in people with asthma, [124] i.v. administration has had no impact
on the airways in clinical experimental studies. [125] There have been
isolated reports of clinically well-documented bronchoconstriction
occurring in patients with or without respiratory disease, thus suggesting that care is required in patients with asthma. [121][,][126][,][127]

However, adenosine can be used cautiously in those with asthma,
although verapamil may be a more appropriate choice in patients

with severe asthma.

Adenosine triphosphate may also be used but clinical experience is

limited.

Calcium channel blockers (verapamil/diltiazem i.v.) and betablockers (e.g. esmolol and metoprolol i.v.) are of value, particularly
in patients with frequent atrial or ventricular premature beats.
Verapamil [0.075 - 0.15 mg/kg i.v. (average 5 - 10 mg) over 2 min] or
i.v. diltiazem [0.25 mg/kg (average 20 mg) over 2 min] has been
shown to terminate SVT in 64�98% of patients, but is associated
with a risk of hypotension. [92,94][�][98,128] These drugs should be avoided
in patients with haemodynamic instability, HF with reduced LV ejection fraction (<40%), a suspicion of VT, or pre-excited AF. Betablockers (i.v.), such as short-acting esmolol (0.5 mg/kg i.v. bolus or

�
0.05 - 0.3 mg/kg/min infusion) or metoprolol (2.5 15 mg given i.v. in

approach to the Valsalva manoeuvre provides a considerable
enhancement of conversion success rates (43 vs. 17% conversion
rate). [41] This enhanced method requires the Valsalva to be completed
semi-recumbent, with supine repositioning and passive leg raise after
the Valsalva strain. Blowing into a 10 mL syringe with sufficient force
to move the plunger may standardize the approach. [104] Carotid sinus
massage is performed with the patient’s neck in an extended position, with the head turned away from the side to which pressure is
applied. It should always be unilateral as there is a potential risk with
bilateral pressure, and it should be limited to 5 s. The patient should
be monitored. This technique should be avoided in patients with previous transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and in patients with carotid
bruits. [3]

Other manoeuvres, such as facial immersion in cold water or

forceful coughing, are rarely used now.

is the first drug of choice. [92][�][94] Pharmacologically relevant electrophysiological influences are mediated through cardiac adenosine A 1
receptors. [105][,][106] Clinical EPSs have documented progressive doserelated prolongation of AV conduction [due to effects on the
atrial�His (AH) interval, and none on the HV interval], culminating in
transient AV block that is then responsible for tachycardia
termination. [107]

The mean dose required for termination is �6 mg. To achieve efficient rhythm correction, injection should be as a rapid bolus with
immediate saline flush. Large, centrally located (e.g. antecubital) veins
are likely to deliver more effective drug concentrations to the heart

2.5 mg boluses), are more effective in reducing the tachycardia rate
than in terminating it. [97][,][99][,][100][,][128] Although evidence for the effectiveness of beta-blockers in terminating SVT is limited, they have an
excellent safety profile in haemodynamically stable patients. Betablockers are contraindicated in patients with decompensated HF.

Caution is needed with concomitant use of i.v. calcium channel block
ers and beta-blockers, because of possible potentiation of hypotensive and bradycardic effects. In the first clinical trial of etripamil, a
short-acting L-type calcium channel blocker with a rapid onset of

action after intranasal administration, conversion rates from SVT to
sinus rhythm ranged from 65�95%. [129]

10.1.2.2 Haemodynamically stable patients
In a patient with wide QRS tachycardia who is haemodynamically stable, the response to vagal manoeuvres may provide insight into the
mechanism responsible for the arrhythmia. SVT with aberrancy, if
definitively identified, may be treated in the same manner as narrow
complex SVT, with vagal manoeuvres or drugs (adenosine and other
AVN-blocking agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel
blockers). [117][�][119][,][129]

Some drugs used for the diagnosis or treatment of SVT (e.g. verapamil) can cause severe haemodynamic deterioration in patients with
a previously stable VT. [64][,][133][,][134] Thus, they should only be used for
the treatment of patients in whom the diagnosis of SVT is fully established and secure. Adenosine may be helpful by means of allowing a
diagnosis or interrupting an adenosine-sensitive VT, but it must be
avoided if pre-excitation on resting ECG suggests a pre-excited
tachycardia. There is a risk that in antidromic re-entry, adenosine
may precipitate cardiac arrest if there is induction of AF by adenosine,
as may occasionally occur. [135]

For pharmacological termination of a haemodynamically stable
wide QRS-complex tachycardia of unknown aetiology, i.v. procainamide or amiodarone can be used in-hospital. [132][,][136][�][138] In the

11.1.1 Sinus tachycardia
Sinus tachycardia is defined as a sinus rate >100 b.p.m. On the ECG,
the P wave is positive in leads I, II, and aVF, and biphasic/negative in

lead V1.

11.1.1.1 Physiological sinus tachycardia

physiological (effort, stress, or pregnancy), and may also arise secondary to other medical conditions or drugs (Table 10). The 12 lead
ECG shows P-wave morphology typical of normal sinus rhythm.
Physiological sinus tachycardia is treated by identifying and eliminating

the cause.

11.1.1.2 Inappropriate sinus tachycardia
IST is defined as a fast sinus rhythm (>100 b.p.m.) at rest or minimal
activity that is out of proportion with the level of physical, emotional,
pathological, or pharmacological stress. [139] The tachycardia tends to
be persistent, and most of the affected patients are young and female,

[140] . [.....................................................................................................................................]


mechanism of IST remains poorly understood and is likely to be multifactorial (e.g. dysautonomia, neurohormonal dysregulation, and
intrinsic sinus node hyperactivity). Recently, a gain-of-function mutation of the pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotidegated 4 (HCN4) channel has been reported in a familial form of
IST. [141] There is also evolving evidence that immunoglobulin G antibeta receptor antibodies are found in IST. [142] The prognosis of IST is
generally considered benign [140] and the arrhythmia has not been associated with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

11.1.1.2.1 Diagnosis. Patients with IST have a wide spectrum of clinical
presentations ranging from usually asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic palpitations to dyspnoea, exercise intolerance, dizziness, and
light-headedness. The diagnosis of IST is one of exclusion of POTS,
sinus re-entrant tachycardia, or focal AT from the superior part of
the crista terminalis or right superior PV. Characteristically, 24 h
Holter monitoring demonstrates a mean heart rate >90 b.p.m. with
an exaggerated heart rate response >100 b.p.m. during waking
hours. [140] Tolerance exercise testing might also be considered to
document the exaggerated heart rate or blood pressure response to
minimal exercise. An EPS is generally not required in making the diagnosis, and should not be routinely performed unless, rarely, sinus
node re-entry is suspected.

11.1.1.2.2 Therapy. Reassurance and lifestyle interventions such as
exercise training, volume expansion, and avoidance of cardiac stimulants should be tried before drug treatment (Figure 6). [139][,][143][,][144] As
the prognosis of IST is benign, treatment is aimed at symptom reduction and may not be necessary. Beta-blockers have been used in
patients with IST for several years, but may be needed at doses high
enough to cause intolerable side effects such as chronic fatigue. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may also be used, but at
doses that may cause hypotension, and the evidence regarding these
drugs is limited. [139][,][145] Ivabradine, a selective blocker of the ‘pacemaker current’ (I f ) in sinoatrial myocytes that directly slow the heart

rate, has been found to be safe and effective in several small trials. [146][�][150] However, blockade of the I f may perturb the feedback
loop underlying baroreceptor control of autonomic balance, thereby
increasing sympathetic activity to the heart. [151] If this effect occurred
chronically at therapeutic dosages, it would be a matter of concern
for its remodelling and pro-arrhythmic potential. Ivabradine should
be preferably co-administered with a beta-blocker when possible;
this combination may also be more beneficial than each drug alone
for IST. [152] Ivabradine should not be taken during pregnancy or

breastfeeding. [153] As a substrate of cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A4,

ivabradine should be avoided or used with caution with concomitant

administration of CYP44A inhibitors (ketoconazole, verapamil, diltiazem, clarithromycin, and grapefruit juice) or inducers (rifampin and
carbamazepine). [154] The limited and disappointing evidence, reported
from small observational studies, suggests that catheter ablation
should not be considered as part of the routine management of most
patients with IST. [155][�][161]

Recommendations for the therapy of sinus tachycardias
















Figure 6 Therapy of sinus tachycardias.

11.1.1.3.2 Therapy. Medical treatment is empirical, and no drugs have
been studied in controlled trials. Verapamil and amiodarone have

demonstrated variable success, whereas beta-blockers are often ineffective. [163] Sinus node re-entrant tachycardia may be effectively and
safely treated with catheter ablation targeting the site of earliest atrial
activation with respect to the P wave. This approach has been shown
to be feasible with a good long-term outcome. [164][�][166]

11.1.1.4 Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome
POTS is defined as a clinical syndrome usually characterized by an
increase in heart rate of >_30 b.p.m. when standing for >30 s (or >_40
b.p.m. in individuals aged 12 - 19 years) and an absence of orthostatic
hypotension (>20 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure). [177][,][178]

The prevalence of POTS is 0.2% and it represents the most common cause of orthostatic intolerance in the young, [178] with most
patients aged between 15 and 25 years, and >75% being female.
Although the long-term prognosis of POTS has been poorly
explored, �50% of patients spontaneously recover within 1 - 3 years.
A number of mechanisms have been described in patients with
POTS, including autonomic nervous system dysfunction,
peripheral autonomic denervation, hypovolaemia, hyperadrenergic
stimulation, diabetic neuropathy, deconditioning, anxiety, and
hypervigilance. [178][�][181]

11.1.1.3 Sinus node re-entrant tachycardia
Sinus node re-entrant tachycardia arises from a re-entry circuit
involving the sinus node and, in contrast to IST, is characterized by
paroxysmal episodes of tachycardia. [176] This uncommon arrhythmia
may be associated with paroxysmal symptoms of palpitation, dizziness, and light-headedness. On the ECG, the polarity and configuration of the P waves are similar to the configuration of sinus
P waves. [163]

monitoring. The evaluation of a patient suspected of having POTS
should eliminate other causes of sinus tachycardia such as hypovolaemia, anaemia, hyperthyroidism, pulmonary embolus, or pheochromocytoma. [178] The clinical history should focus on defining
the chronicity of the condition, possible causes of orthostatic
tachycardia, modifying factors, impact on daily activities, and
potential triggers.

11.1.1.4.2 Therapy. Non-pharmacological treatments should be
attempted first in all patients. These include withdrawing medications
that might worsen POTS, such as norepinephrine transport inhibitors, increasing blood volume with enhanced salt and fluid intake,
reducing venous pooling with compression garments, and limiting
deconditioning. Patients should engage in a regular, graduated, and
supervised exercise programme featuring aerobic reconditioning
with some resistance training for the thighs. Initially, exercise should
be restricted to non-upright exercise, including the use of rowing
machines and swimming, to minimize orthostatic stress on the
heart. [180][�][182]

If non-pharmacological approaches prove ineffective, pharmacological therapies may be targeted at specific aspects. Patients strongly

�
suspected of having hypovolaemia should drink >_2 3 L of water per
day, and dietary salt intake should be increased to �10�12 g/day if
tolerated. Midodrine significantly reduces orthostatic tachycardia but
to a lesser degree than i.v. saline. [170] Midodrine has a rapid onset with
only brief effects and is usually administered three times daily. The
drug should only be administered during daytime hours as it can
cause supine hypertension. To reduce unpleasant sinus tachycardia

�
and palpitations, low-dose propranolol [10 20 mg per os (p.o.)]
acutely lowers standing heart rate and improves symptoms in
patients with POTS, while higher doses of propranolol are less well
tolerated. [172] Long-acting propranolol does not improve the quality
of life of patients with POTS. [167] Non-selective beta-blockers are
preferable because they additionally block epinephrine-mediated

beta-2-vasodilation, but other beta-blockers have not been

adequately studied. Pyridostigmine, a cholinergic agonist that works
by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, can increase parasympathetic autonomic tone and has a lower risk of hypertension compared with
other medications. Potential side effects include abdominal cramping,
diarrhoea, and muscle cramps. [173][,][174] Ivabradine slows sinus rates
without affecting blood pressure, and in an open-label study �60% of
patients with POTS had symptomatic improvement. [175] Ivabradine
should ideally be administered with concomitant beta-blockers for
long-term therapy. [151]

11.1.2 Focal atrial tachycardia
Focal AT is defined as an organized atrial rhythm >_100 b.p.m. initiated
from a discrete origin and spreading over both atria in a centrifugal
pattern. The ventricular rate varies, depending on AV nodal conduction. In asymptomatic young people (<50 years of age), the prevalence of focal AT has been reported to be as low as 0.34% with an
increased prevalence of 0.46% in symptomatic arrhythmia patients. [183]

Most studies have reported no influence of sex.

Symptoms may include palpitations, shortness of breath, chest

sustained or incessant. Dynamic forms with recurrent interruptions
and reinitiations may be frequent.
In patients with PV-related AT, the focus is located at the ostium
of the vein (or within 1 cm of the designated ostium) [184] rather than

�
further distally (2 4 cm). [185]

11.1.2.1 Diagnosis
P wave identification from a 12 lead ECG recording during tachycardia is critical (Figure 7). Depending on the AV conduction and AT
rate, the P waves may be hidden in the QRS or T waves. The P waves
are monomorphic with stable CL, which helps to rule out organized
AF. Adenosine injection can help by slowing the ventricular rate or,
less frequently, by terminating focal AT. A discrete P wave with an
intervening isoelectric interval suggests a focal AT. However, distinguishing focal from macro-re-entrant arrhythmias by surface ECG is
not always possible. The presence of an isoelectric line does not rule
out a macro-re-entrant mechanism, particularly in the presence of
scar atrial tissue (from structural heart disease or previous extensive
ablation/surgery procedures). In a normal heart and in the absence of
previous ablation, the usual ECG localization rules apply, [186] but their
value in localizing the origin of the arrhythmia is also limited in this
context. Focal AT may arise from any site in both atria, but particular
sites of predilection in the normal heart rate are the crista terminalis,
the tricuspid and mitral valve annulus, and within the thoracic veins
joining the atria. [46][,][186] A negative P wave in lead I and aVL suggests an
LA origin. V1 is negative when the arrhythmia source or exit is in the
lateral right atrium, while septal right atrial (RA) and LA origins show
biphasic or positive P waves (Figure 7). Negative P waves in the inferior leads suggest a caudal origin, whereas positive P waves in those
leads favour a superior location.

11.1.2.2 Acute therapy
Hard data for an evidence-based choice of drugs for the acute therapy of focal AT are scarce. In general, acute therapy may be initiated
with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, which may terminate
focal ATs or slow the ventricular rate (Figure 8). [92][,][94][,][187][,][188]

Adenosine (i.v.) may terminate AT [delayed after-depolarizations
(DAD)-triggered AT], but the tachycardia may also continue with AV
block. Class IA, IC, and III drugs may also be effective, by prolonging
refractoriness or suppressing automaticity. [189][�][191] Amiodarone may
also be used for cardioversion or slowing of the ventricular rate, [192]

but the efficacy of rate control is unproven in critically ill patients
with atrial arrhythmias. [193] DC cardioversion is usually effective in
acutely terminating the tachycardia, irrespective of the mechanism.

However, in incessant forms of focal AT due to enhanced automatic
ity, the arrhythmia reinitiates, and repeating DC cardioversion is
unlikely to be appropriate.

11.1.2.3 Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation is the treatment of choice for recurrent focal

AT, especially for incessant AT due to which TCM ensues
(Figure 9). [196] Distinguishing macro-re-entrant from focal ATs is
critical for the ablation strategy. Focal ATs, as well as localized/
micro-re-entry ATs, display a centrifugal activation pattern that
spreads throughout the atria. Mapping and ablation of focal ATs is
based on determining the earliest activation site. In PV-related AT,
focal ablation may be performed, but electrical isolation of both

suspected of having hypovolaemia should drink >_2 3 L of water per
day, and dietary salt intake should be increased to �10�12 g/day if
tolerated. Midodrine significantly reduces orthostatic tachycardia but
to a lesser degree than i.v. saline. [170] Midodrine has a rapid onset with
only brief effects and is usually administered three times daily. The
drug should only be administered during daytime hours as it can
cause supine hypertension. To reduce unpleasant sinus tachycardia

and palpitations, low-dose propranolol [10 20 mg per os (p.o.)]
acutely lowers standing heart rate and improves symptoms in
patients with POTS, while higher doses of propranolol are less well

of life of patients with POTS. [167] Non-selective beta-blockers are
preferable because they additionally block epinephrine-mediated

beta-2-vasodilation, but other beta-blockers have not been

adequately studied. Pyridostigmine, a cholinergic agonist that works
by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, can increase parasympathetic autonomic tone and has a lower risk of hypertension compared with
other medications. Potential side effects include abdominal cramping,
diarrhoea, and muscle cramps. [173][,][174] Ivabradine slows sinus rates
without affecting blood pressure, and in an open-label study �60% of

11.1.2.4 Chronic therapy
Studies addressing chronic therapy are also limited, and thus firm

conclusions cannot be drawn. Beta-blockers and calcium channel


blockers may be effective, and there is a low risk of side effects
(Figure 9). [188] Class IC drugs may be effective if first-line therapy has
failed. [189][,][190][,][198] Ivabradine may also be effective in focal AT, [199][,][200] and
ideally should be given with a beta-blocker. Amiodarone has been
tried in the young and paediatric populations, [201][,][202] and theoretically
should be attractive in patients with impaired LV function. However,
its long-term efficacy is limited by its side effects.

11.1.3 Multifocal atrial tachycardia
Multifocal AT is defined as a rapid, irregular rhythm with at least three
distinct morphologies of P waves on the surface ECG. Multifocal AT is
commonly associated with underlying conditions, including pulmonary
disease, pulmonary hypertension, coronary disease, and valvular heart
disease, as well as hypomagnesaemia and theophylline therapy. [209] It
may also be seen in healthy infants under 1 year of age, and carries a
good prognosis in the absence of underlying cardiac disease. [210]

It may be difficult to distinguish multifocal AT from AF on a single
ECG trace, so a 12 lead ECG is indicated to confirm the diagnosis.
On the ECG, the atrial rate is >100 b.p.m. Unlike AF, there is a distinct isoelectric period between visible P waves. The PP, PR, and RR
intervals are variable. Although it is assumed that the variability of
P-wave morphology implies a multifocal origin, there have been very
few mapping studies of multifocal AT.

11.1.3.1 Therapy
The first-line treatment is management of the underlying condition.
Magnesium (i.v.) may also be helpful in patients, even in those with
normal magnesium levels. [211] Antiarrhythmic medications, in general,
are not helpful in suppressing multifocal AT. [209] Management often
involves slowing conduction at the AVN level to control heart rate.
Verapamil has some efficacy in patients with multifocal AT who do
not have ventricular dysfunction, sinus node dysfunction, or AV
block. [212][,][213] Metoprolol has been found to be superior to verapamil, [214] and beta-blockers can be used with caution to treat multifocal

AT in the absence of respiratory decompensation, sinus node

dysfunction, or AV block. There has also been a case report on the
successful use of ibutilide. [215] In symptomatic and medically refractory
cases in which LV deterioration is seen, AV nodal modification may
be used for the control of ventricular rate. [216]

11.1.4 Macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardias
Atrial flutter and focal AT are traditionally defined according to the
ECG appearance: continuous regular electrical activity, most commonly
a saw-tooth pattern, vs. discrete P waves with an isoelectric line in
between. ECGs with flutter-like appearances are mostly due to macrore-entrant atrial circuits but micro-re-entry is also possible. However,
MRATs with a significant part of the activation of the circuit in protected areas may display a focal AT pattern, with discrete P waves. [220]

11.1.4.1 Cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent macro�re-entrant AT

11.1.4.1.1 Typical atrial flutter: common (counter-clockwise) and
reverse (clockwise). Typical common atrial flutter is the most frequent cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)-dependent flutter, i.e. a macro-reentry circuit around the tricuspid annulus using the CTI as a critical
passage at the inferior boundary. Activation goes downward in the RA
free wall, through the CTI, and ascends in the right septum. Activation
of the LA is passive. The upper part of the circuit may be anterior or
posterior to the superior vena cava. This activation is also known as
counter-clockwise (or anticlockwise) when seen from the apex.
When the circuit is activated in the opposite direction, i.e. clockwise,
it results in a different ECG pattern, then called typical reverse flutter.

11.1.4.1.2 Diagnosis. In counter-clockwise flutter, the circuit results in

�
regular atrial activation from 250 330 b.p.m., with negative sawtooth waves in inferior leads and positive waves in V1 (Figure 10). In

clockwise flutter, ECG flutter waves in inferior leads look positive
and broad, and are frequently bimodal negative in V1. [220][,][221] Typical
atrial flutter has a strong reproducible anatomical dependence, [222]

resulting in the morphological reproducibility of the ECG. However,
this well-recognized ECG pattern may be significantly changed when
atrial activation has been modified, as it is in cardiac surgery involving
atrial tissue, after extensive radiofrequency ablation, or in advanced
atrial disease. [223][,][224] Antiarrhythmic drugs may also modify the typical
ECG pattern. [225] In these situations, an atypical ECG does not rule
out a circuit of typical flutter using the CTI. [226]

Typical flutter is related to AF in clinical practice, with both being
associated with similar clinical settings and coexisting in the same
patients: AF may trigger atrial flutter, and after typical flutter ablation
AF is frequent. [23][,][227][�][229] Typical flutter may also frequently occur in
patients treated for AF with class IC drugs or amiodarone. In this
case, flutter rate may be reduced to <200 b.p.m. facilitating 1:1 AV
conduction. The action of antiarrhythmic drugs on ventricular activation may result in wide QRS tachycardia. [230][�][232] . [......................................................]


Beyond symptoms associated with high-rate and loss of atrial kick,
reversible systolic dysfunction and subsequent TCM are not
unusual. [233][,][234]

11.1.4.1.3 Acute therapy. Although the first step should be rate control when the ventricular rate is high, this may be difficult to achieve.
AV nodal blocking drugs, [235][�][238] including amiodarone applied mostly
in HF or critically ill patients, [239][,][240] may be of help, but cardioversion
may be necessary (Figure 11).

In some cases, presenting with 2:1 AV block, the diagnosis of atrial
flutter may not be obvious on the ECG. In these situations, i.v. adenosine may increase the degree of AV block and reveal the typical ECG
pattern. However, adenosine can produce a rebound increase in AV
conduction to 1:1 and may also precipitate AF. [271][,][272] Thus, it should
only be used if deemed necessary for diagnosis and resuscitation
equipment is available.

Rate control should be the first step in very symptomatic patients
with rapid ventricular rates. This is a particularly difficult goal in atrial

flutter and even the combination of AVN-blocking drugs (digoxin,
beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers) [235][�][238] may fail, making cardioversion to sinus rhythm necessary. Dofetilide and ibutilide, pure class III antiarrhythmic drugs, are generally effective in
interrupting atrial flutter in i.v. administration (dofetilide may be
also given orally for this purpose), while class IA and IC drugs have
little or no effect. [250][�][257] Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs should not
be used in the absence of AV-blocking agents because of the risk
of slowing the atrial rate, which may result in 1:1 AV conduction. [273][,][274] Amiodarone may not be very effective acutely to reestablish sinus rhythm, but it does help to control the ventricular
rate if it is too fast. [275][,][276] Low-energy electrical cardioversion is
commonly used with haemodynamic compromise or after failure
of previous actions, but it could be the first choice due to its high
efficacy. Electrical cardioversion for atrial flutter is more effective
and less energy is required, compared with AF. [248][,][249] When atrial
electrodes are in place, high-rate stimulation can be used to convert flutter, sometimes through AF. [258][,][259] If pacing induces AF,
this may allow better control of the ventricular rate than flutter.
Atrial stimulation can also be done with percutaneous endocardial
electrodes or from the oesophagus; this is mostly done in paediatrics. [261] Pre-treatment with procainamide may facilitate conversion of atrial flutter by atrial pacing. [277] Data on pre-cardioversion
anticoagulation are lacking, but most probably patients should be
treated the same as those with AF. [4][,][278]

11.1.4.1.4 Catheter ablation. Catheter ablation is the most effective

therapy to maintain sinus rhythm, and is clearly superior to amiodarone. [262][,][263] Ablation of CTI with confirmed bidirectional conduction block results in a <10% rate of recurrence. [279] However,
the incidence of AF is high in the long-term. [280] When typical CTIdependent atrial flutter ensues during antiarrhythmic drug therapy
(class IC or amiodarone) for AF, CTI ablation is a reasonable
choice to ensure that antiarrhythmic drugs can be continued for
AF control. [262][,][263]

Although no procedure-related mortality had been detected in
early studies, [203][,][204] in recent studies, mortality and stroke rates of
0.2 - 0.34 and 0.19 - 0.5%, respectively, have been reported
(Table 11). [12][,][206] In a recent registry, ablation for flutter had a higher
mortality than that for AF (0.3 vs. 0.05%), but this might have been
due to the comorbidities or advanced ages of patients referred for
flutter ablation. [207]

11.1.4.1.5 Chronic therapy. Rate control is part of the therapeutic
approach, using AV nodal blocking agents such as diltiazem, verapamil,
or beta-blockers (Figure 12). When ablation is not feasible or the
patient’s preference, antiarrhythmic drugs may also be used to maintain
sinus rhythm. Dofetilide [257] and sotalol [281] are useful, but there are concerns about pro-arrhythmia. Amiodarone may have a role, [263] but it
should be restricted to cases of HF or significant structural heart disease.

11.1.4.1.6 Anticoagulation. Data about the embolic risk of atrial
flutter have usually been derived in the presence of concomitant
AF, thus making individualized risk stratification difficult. Left
atrial (LA) appendage ‘stunning’ and thrombi seem to be lower . [.......................................................................................................................................................................]


11.1.4.1.4 Catheter ablation. Catheter ablation is the most effective

therapy to maintain sinus rhythm, and is clearly superior to amiodarone. [262][,][263] Ablation of CTI with confirmed bidirectional conduction block results in a <10% rate of recurrence. [279] However,
the incidence of AF is high in the long-term. [280] When typical CTIdependent atrial flutter ensues during antiarrhythmic drug therapy
(class IC or amiodarone) for AF, CTI ablation is a reasonable
choice to ensure that antiarrhythmic drugs can be continued for
AF control. [262][,][263]

Although no procedure-related mortality had been detected in
early studies, [203][,][204] in recent studies, mortality and stroke rates of
0.2 - 0.34 and 0.19 - 0.5%, respectively, have been reported
(Table 11). [12][,][206] In a recent registry, ablation for flutter had a higher
mortality than that for AF (0.3 vs. 0.05%), but this might have been
due to the comorbidities or advanced ages of patients referred for
flutter ablation. [207]


11.1.4.1.5 Chronic therapy. Rate control is part of the therapeutic

or beta-blockers (Figure 12). When ablation is not feasible or the
patient’s preference, antiarrhythmic drugs may also be used to maintain
sinus rhythm. Dofetilide [257] and sotalol [281] are useful, but there are concerns about pro-arrhythmia. Amiodarone may have a role, [263] but it
should be restricted to cases of HF or significant structural heart disease.


11.1.4.1.6 Anticoagulation. Data about the embolic risk of atrial
flutter have usually been derived in the presence of concomitant
AF, thus making individualized risk stratification difficult. Left
atrial (LA) appendage ‘stunning’ and thrombi seem to be lower


compared with those in AF. [247][,][282] The thrombo-embolic risk of
atrial flutter, although lower than that of AF, [246] is still significant. [241][�][244] That, together with the association with AF, justifies
thromboprophylaxis, and anticoagulation has been recommended as in AF. [2][,][3] These recommendations extend to the acute
setting for cardioversion when flutter lasts for >48 h. [278]

However, it should be noted that there is a lack of prospective,
dedicated, randomized studies on the subject. Furthermore, the
value of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [Cardiac failure, Hypertension, Age
>_75 (Doubled), Diabetes, Stroke (Doubled) � Vascular disease,

�
Age 65 74 and Sex category (Female)] score in preventing
ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial flutter has not been established, [245] and in patients without concomitant AF the threshold
for the initiation of anticoagulation appears to be higher than that
for patients with AF. [246]

11.1.4.1.7 Other cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent macro�reentrant atrial tachycardia. An atypical ECG pattern may not
exclude CTI-dependent MRAT. [283] Lower-loop re-entry refers to a
circuit rotating around the inferior vena cava instead of around the
tricuspid annulus. It may be clockwise or counter-clockwise. [284][,][285]

When rotating counter-clockwise, it might be considered a variant of
typical counter-clockwise flutter with a caudal shift of the cranial
turning point posterior to the entry of the superior vena cava, resulting in a similar ECG appearance. ‘Figure-of-eight double-loop reentry’ may also occur around the inferior vena cava and tricuspid
annulus, and mimic typical clockwise atrial flutter. [285] Other circuits
using part of the CTI or even restricted inside it, are in essence CTIdependent with a similar ECG appearance to typical common
flutter. [286][,][287]

11.1.4.2 Non-cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent macro�re-entrant atrial
tachycardia
The terms non-CTI-dependent MRAT and atypical flutter are
used interchangeably, and describe flutter waves in the ECG not
suggestive of typical circuits. The pitfall with this use comes from
the atypical ECG that may happen when typical circuits develop in
diseased atria, most frequently after surgery or extensive ablation,
or under the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. Conversely, upperloop re-entry may mimic a typical flutter ECG pattern without
being CTI-dependent. [283] True atypical flutter is actually a post hoc
diagnosis when the circuit has been outlined and dependence on

CTI has been ruled out.

11.1.4.2.1 Right atrium macro2re-entrant atrial tachycardia. Atrial
sutures and patches used for complex congenital heart disease surgery, together with progressive atrial damage, create multiple
obstacles and protected isthmuses that constitute the substrate for
complex and multiple MRAT. [288][,][289] This usually happens around RA
free wall scars. However, in patients with complex congenital heart
disease, the presence of extensive atrial scars hinders the differential
diagnosis of focal or MRAT. [290]

Figure-of-eight double-loop tachycardias mimicking the ECG pattern of a common atrial flutter may also occur following surgical
atriotomy. [291]

CTI = cavotricuspid isthmus; MRAT = macro-re-entrant atrial tachycardia.


RA MRAT may also occur in the absence of previous interven
tion. Most of these are sustained around areas of ‘electrical
silence’ in the RA free wall, probably due to fibrosis. [224][,][264][,][266]

Atypical atrial flutter could also arise from upper loop re-entry in
the right atrium with conduction through the gap in the crista
terminalis. [269]

Rate control is often difficult due to the regularity and usually
slow rate of the tachycardia. Antiarrhythmic drugs are often inef
fective, or their use is limited because of structural heart disease

and comorbidities. Radiofrequency ablation of often several crit
ical isthmuses is the most effective treatment. Circuits around

scars of longitudinal atriotomy can be mapped and ablated with
good long-term results. [267][,][292] However, owing to the complexity
of possible substrates and difficulty of reaching critical isthmuses,
ablation procedures for these patients should be restricted to
experienced operators and centres.

11.1.4.2.2 Left atrium macro2re-entrant atrial tachycardia. Circuits
sustaining LA atypical flutter/MRAT are most usually due to electrically silent areas of abnormal tissue, following medical interventions
or progressive atrial degeneration/fibrosis. [268] Anatomical obstacles

such as the ostia of PVs, and mitral annulus, are often involved.

or progressive atrial degeneration/fibrosis. [268] Anatomical obstacles

such as the ostia of PVs, and mitral annulus, are often involved.


Owing to its widespread use, AF ablation is the procedure that frequently causes the lesions able to sustain re-entry circuits, usually after
linear ablation or extensive defragmentation. Pre-existing atrial disease
is also predictive of macro-re-entry. [293] Localized segmental PV disconnection may cause focal tachycardias, [294] and circumferential antral
ablation may also create MRAT due to gaps in the lines. [295][�][299] AT
due to a small re-entrant circuit after ablation of AF may possibly be
distinguished from macro-re-entry by a shorter P-wave duration. RA
MRATs have a higher incidence of negative polarity in at least one precordial lead compared with LA macro-re-entry. [300][�][302]

Atrial circuits are also created after surgery for different conditions, including mitral valve disease, and are related to incisions or
cannulation. [303] Surgery to treat AF may also result in macro-re-entry
circuits and focal AT. [304]

Circuits causing atypical left MRAT may also occur in the LA without prior intervention, commonly, but not invariably, associated with
significant left heart disease. [305] These are based on areas of electrical
silence, probably due to fibrosis, engaging anatomical obstacles such
as the ostia of the PVs or the mitral annulus, and may be ablated by
interrupting critical isthmuses. [265][,][306] Circuits may also happen in the
LA septum due to slow conduction caused by atrial disease or antiarrhythmic drugs. [307]

ESC Guidelines 683


Peri-mitral flutter, sometimes incorporating silent areas at the
roof of the LA, is ablated in a similar way to peri-tricuspid circuits.
However, the deployment of a stable line of block at critical isthmuses is more challenging. [308][�][310] Circuits around the PVs are
also frequently recognized and ablated. [280][,][295][,][296] Intervention to
treat these tachycardias after the initial procedure should be
delayed, if possible, for >_3 months. As part of the maturation
process of the deployed lesions, some tachycardias may be transient in nature, [311] and initial rate control and/or use of antiarrhythmic drugs is favoured.

11.2 Atrioventricular junctional
arrhythmias
11.2.1 Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia
AVNRT denotes re-entry in the area of the AVN, but the exact cir
cuit remains elusive. The AVN is a three-dimensional structure with

greater variability in the space constant of tissue, and poor gap junction connectivity due to differential expression of connexin isoforms,
conditions that provide an explanation for dual conduction and nodal
re-entrant arrhythmogenesis. [312][�][314] There has also been considerable histological and electrophysiological evidence that the right and
left inferior extensions of the human AVN, and the atrionodal inputs
that they facilitate, may provide the anatomical substrate for the slow
pathway. [315][,][316] Thus, comprehensive models of the tachycardia . [.........................................................................]


circuit for all forms of AVNRT based on the concept of atrionodal
inputs have been proposed. [47,317]

Onset of AVNRT seems to occur bimodally over time. In
many patients, attacks indeed manifest early in life, whereas in a substantial proportion of patients AVNRT starts later, e.g. in the
fourth or fifth decade of life. [318] One-half of the patients with minimal
symptoms and short-lived, infrequent episodes of tachycardia may
become asymptomatic within the next 13 years. [319] AVNRT may
result in AF that usually, although not invariably, is eliminated following catheter ablation of AVNRT. [320] Familial AVNRT should be
considered. [321]

11.2.1.1.1 12 lead electrocardiogram during tachycardia. Typically,
AVNRT is a narrow complex tachycardia, i.e. QRS duration <120 ms,
unless there is aberrant conduction, which is usually of the RBBB type,
or a previous conduction defect exists (Figure 13). AV dissociation is
exceptionally uncommon, but it can occur as neither the atria nor the
ventricles are necessary for the re-entry circuit. Thus, coexistence with
AF or AV conduction block is possible but rare. [66][,][322] ST-segment
depression may be seen during or after the tachycardia.

In the typical form of AVNRT (also called slow�fast AVNRT),
retrograde P waves are constantly related to the QRS and, in the

patients may coexist with the typical form. [329] A higher incidence of
atypical AVNRT has been documented in athletes. [330] In the socalled ‘fast�slow form of AVNRT, retrograde atrial electrograms
begin well after ventricular activation with an AH/HA ratio <1,
indicating that retrograde conduction is slower than antegrade

conduction. The AH interval is <185�200 ms. The VA interval

measured from the onset of ventricular activation on surface ECG

to the earliest deflection of the atrial activation in the His bundle

electrogram is >60 ms. Earliest retrograde atrial activation has generally been reported at the base of the triangle of Koch, near the
coronary sinus ostium, but it can be variable, with eccentric atrial
activation at the lower septum or even the distal coronary
sinus. [328][,][331][,][332] In the ‘slow�slow’ form, the AH/HA ratio is >1

and the AH interval >200 ms, but the VA interval is >60 ms, suggesting that two slow pathways are utilized for both anterograde
and retrograde activation. Earliest retrograde atrial activation is
usually at the coronary sinus ostium, but variants of left-sided atrial
retrograde activation have also been published. [333][,][334] The distinction between ‘fast�slow’ and ‘slow�slow’ forms is of no practical
significance, and certain cases of atypical AVNRT cannot be classified according to described criteria. [324] There is also evidence that
the ‘fast’ pathway during slow�fast AVNRT is not identical to the
‘fast’ component of so-called fast�slow AVNRT. [329] Therefore,
AVNRT can be classified as typical or atypical according to the HA
interval, or—when a His bundle electrogram is not reliably
recorded—according to the VA interval measured on the His bundle recording electrode. [322] Table 12 presents a conventional classification system. Other approaches have also been published. [335]

11.2.1.2 Therapy

Recommendations for the management of atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT)


Table 12 Classification of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia types [324]

|Col1|Col2|HA|Col4|VA (His)|Col6|AH/HA|Col8|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Typical AVNRT|Typical AVNRT|<_70 ms|<_70 ms|<_60 ms|<_60 ms|>1|>1|
|Atypical AVNRT|Atypical AVNRT|>70 ms|>70 ms|>60 ms|>60 ms|Variable|Variable|



Atypical atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia has been traditionally classified as fast�slow (His�atrial >70 ms, ventriculoatrial >60, atrial�His/His�atrial
<1, and atrial�His <200 ms) or slow�slow (His�atrial >70 ms, ventriculoatrial
interval >60 ms, atrial�His/His�atrial >1, and atrial�His >200 ms). Intermediate,
unclassified types may also exist. AH = atrial�His interval; AVNRT = atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia; HA = His�atrial interval; VA = ventriculoa
trial interval measured from the onset of ventricular activation on surface ECG to

the earliest deflection of the atrial activation on the His bundle electrogram.

majority of cases, are indiscernible or very close to the QRS complex. Thus, P waves are either masked by the QRS complex or
seen as a small terminal P’ wave that is not present during sinus
rhythm. [323]

In the atypical form of AVNRT, P waves are clearly visible before
the QRS, i.e. RP>PR, denoting a long RP tachycardia, and are negative
or shallow in leads II, III, aVF, and V6, but positive in V1. [317]

Tachycardia-related ST-segment depression, RR-interval variation, as well as QRS alternans may be seen. Specific, although
modestly sensitive, ECG criteria for AVNRT, as opposed to AT
and AVRT, are a pseudo R deflection in lead V1 and a pseudo S
wave in the inferior leads, a notch in lead aVL, and a pseudo R in
aVR. [45] If the tachycardia is initiated by atrial ectopic beats, the initial (ectopic) P wave usually differs from the subsequent (retrograde) P waves.

11.2.1.1.2 Electrophysiology study. Heterogeneity of both fast and
slow conduction patterns has been well described, and all forms of
AVNRT may display anterior, posterior, and middle, or even LA retrograde, activation patterns. [322][�][324] Thus, specific electrophysiological manoeuvres may be required for differential diagnosis of typical
and, especially, atypical AVNRT from focal AT or AVRT due to a
concealed septal pathway. [45] The rare form of verapamil-sensitive AT
is due to re-entry in the atrial tissue close to the AVN, but not the
AV nodal conducting system. [325]

11.2.1.1.3 Typical atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia. In
the slow�fast form of AVNRT, the onset of atrial activation appears
before, at the onset of, or just after the QRS complex, thus maintain
�
ing an AH/His atrial (HA) ratio >1. The VA interval measured from

the onset of ventricular activation on surface ECG to the earliest

deflection of the atrial activation in the His bundle electrogram is <_60
ms. Although, the earliest retrograde atrial activation is typically
recorded at the His bundle electrogram, careful mapping studies
have demonstrated that posterior or even left septal fast pathways
may occur in <_7.6% in patients with typical AVNRT. [326][�][328]

11.2.1.1.4 Atypical atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia.
Atypical AVNRT is seen in �6% of all AVNRT cases, [317] and in some

they are less successful in AVNRT than in AVRT. [89][,][90][,][102] A single
dose of oral diltiazem (120 mg) plus a beta-blocker (i.e. propranolol 80 mg) may convert <_94% of patients, but there is a risk of
hypotension, transient AV block, or—rarely—syncope. [342][,][343]

Caution is needed in the elderly, and in patients with known sinus
or AV nodal conduction disturbances. A single dose of oral flecainide (3 mg/kg) may also be effective, albeit at a lower rate. [342][,][344]

Intranasal etripamil is promising (see section 10.1.1). [129] Rarely,
when vagal manoeuvres and adenosine cannot terminate the
tachycardia and hypotension ensues, synchronized DC cardioversion is indicated [101] (Figure 14).

11.2.1.2.2 Catheter ablation. A recent randomized clinical trial

(RCT) that compared catheter ablation as first-line treatment with
antiarrhythmic drugs demonstrated significant benefits in arrhythmiarelated hospitalizations. [336] Furthermore, catheter ablation for SVT in
general, and AVNRT in particular, is the current treatment of choice
for symptomatic patients because it substantially improves quality of
life [28][,][345][,][346] and reduces costs. [347][�][349] Slow-pathway modification is
effective in both typical and atypical AVNRT. [338] Usually, a combined
anatomical and mapping approach is employed, with ablation lesions
delivered at the inferior part of the triangle of Koch, either from the
right or the left septal side. [337][�][339][,][350][,][351] This approach offers a suc
cess rate of 97%, has an �1.3�4% recurrence rate, and has been

associated with a risk of AV block of <1% in previous
reports. [203][,][204][,][352][,][353] Recent experience indicates that in experienced
centres, the procedure can be accomplished in both typical and atypical AVNRT with almost no risk of AV block, by targeting the inferior
nodal extension and avoiding the mid-septum, and the roof of the
coronary sinus. [208][,][338][,][354][,][355] Success rates are lower (82%) and the
risk of heart block higher (14%) in patients with adult congenital heart
disease (ACHD). [356] Usually, recurrences are seen within 3 months
following a successful procedure in symptomatic patients who experience frequent episodes of tachycardia, [317][,][329][,][336][,][338] but in the young,
aged <_18 years, recurrences may be seen as long as 5 years
post-ablation. [357] IST may occur, but is usually transient and not
frequent following slow-pathway ablation. [358] Advanced age is not a
contraindication for slow-pathway ablation. [359] The pre-existence
of first-degree heart block carries a higher risk for late AV block
and avoidance of extensive slow pathway ablation is preferable
under such conditions. [360] There is almost no procedure-related
mortality. [11][,][13][,][203][�][205,208] Cryoablation may carry a lower risk of AV
block, but is associated with a significantly higher recurrence
rate. [361][�][363] Its favourable safety profile and higher long-term success
rate in younger patients make it especially attractive for the treatment of children. [364] AVNRT is a cause of inappropriate shocks
in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and,
in the case of frequent episodes, catheter ablation is clearly
indicated. [365]

11.2.1.2.3 Chronic therapy. Patients with minimal symptoms and
short-lived, infrequent episodes of tachycardia can be followed-up
without the need for ablation or long-term pharmacological therapy (Figure 15). Approximately one-half of them may become
asymptomatic within the next 13 years. [319] Chronic administration
of antiarrhythmic drugs decreases the frequency and duration of

propranolol370 or, in the absence of ischaemic or structural
heart disease, flecainide [380] and propafenone, [381] may be tried.
Selective catheter ablation at the site of the earliest retrograde

atrial activation is feasible, but carries a lower success rate and
higher AV block risk compared with AVNRT (5 - 10%). [369][,][382]

Cryoablation is safer. [375][,][383]

Non-paroxysmal junctional tachycardia was frequently diagnosed in the past as a junctional rhythm of gradual onset and ter
�
mination, with a rate between 70 130 b.p.m., and was considered
a typical example of digitalis-induced DADs and triggered activity
in the AVN. [3] The RP interval during tachycardia is variable.
Myocardial ischaemia, hypokalaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and myocarditis are also associated conditions.

Non-re-entrant AV nodal tachycardia caused by simultaneous multiple nodal pathway conduction (often called
double-fire pathology or dual AV nodal tachycardia) is an
uncommon mechanism of AV nodal tachycardia, [384][,][385] and has
been associated with repetitive retrograde concealment or
‘linking’ phenomena. [386][�][388] These are expressed in the form
of ventricular pauses with consistent AV relationship after the
pause, and can often be misdiagnosed as AF. [389] These extremely
rare tachycardias may cause TCM and respond to slow-pathway

ablation.

11.3 Atrioventricular arrhythmias
AVRTs use an anatomically defined re-entrant circuit that consists of

�
two limbs: first, the AVN HPS, and second, an AP also called the

bypass tract. The two limbs are characterized by differences in refractoriness and conduction times, with critically timed premature atrial
or ventricular beats initiating re-entrant tachycardia. On rare occa
sions, the circuit consists of two APs.

11.3.1 Accessory pathways
APs are single or multiple strands of myocardial cells that bypass
the physiological conduction system, and directly connect atrial
and ventricular myocardium. [390] These AV connections are due to
incomplete embryological development of the AV annuli, without
complete separation of the atria and ventricles. While there are
different types of APs, the most common are those that connect
the atrium and the ventricle along the mitral or tricuspid annulus.
Approximately 60% are located along the mitral valve and are
referred to as left free wall APs, 25% insert along the septal aspect
of the mitral or tricuspid annulus, and �15% insert along the right
free wall. [391][�][393] Because ventricular muscle is lacking in the proximity of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve, left-sided APs are
usually limited to the region of the mitral annulus at the attachment of the mural (posterior) leaflet. APs located in the superoparaseptal area in close proximity to the His bundle and AVN may
also occur. [394]

APs present characteristic electrophysiological features that differ
from AV nodal conduction properties. They typically exhibit fast conduction (with the exception of atypical pathways-see section 11.3.9),
dependent on a sodium current similar to that of myocardial cells.
Moreover, although a majority of APs conduct both antegradely and
retrogradely, some propagate impulses in only one direction. Those
that conduct in the antegrade direction only are uncommon (<_10%),

AVNRT, but has a variable success rate in abolishing tachycardia
episodes, ranging from 13 - 82%, and <_20% of patients may discontinue therapy. [323] In view of the excellent success rate and minimal
risk of catheter ablation in symptomatic cases, the value of longterm antiarrhythmic drug therapy seems very limited.

11.2.2 Non-re-entrant junctional tachycardias
Junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET), or focal junctional tachycardia, is an uncommon arrhythmia that arises from abnormal
automaticity at the AVN or proximal His bundle. Focal junctional
tachycardia in children may be seen as a congenital arrhythmia or,
more often, early after infant open-heart surgery. [366][,][367]

Congenital junctional tachycardia carries considerable morbidity
and mortality. [368] Junctional tachycardia can also be seen in adult
patients with a structurally normal heart, [369][,][370] and has in the past
been associated with non-fibrinolysed acute MI. [371] The usual ECG
finding in JET is a narrow QRS tachycardia with a short RP interval
or AV dissociation. Occasionally, the tachycardia might be irregu
lar and resemble AF.

Propranolol (i.v.) with or without procainamide, [370] verapamil,
or procainamide, [372] or flecainide, [373] may be used for acute therapy, but data are scarce. Amiodarone (i.v.) is the drug of choice
for post-operative JET as well as for preventing early JET in children after open-heart surgery. [374][,][375] In children with congenital
junctional tachycardia, amiodarone alone, or with propafenone
or ivabradine, appears effective. [368][,][376][�][379] For chronic therapy,

ESC Guidelines 687


whereas those that conduct in the retrograde direction only are
more frequent (<_50%). When the AP conducts antegradely, ventricular pre-excitation is usually evident at rest during sinus rhythm and
the AP is referred to as ‘manifest’. Conversely, APs are referred to as
‘concealed’ if they exclusively conduct retrogradely. Concealed APs
may have decremental properties. [395] The term ‘latent AP’ denotes
an AP that is not, or is barely, visible due to location or faster conduction through the AVN.

Multiple APs occur in <_12% of patients with pre-excitation, and in
<_50% in patients with Ebstein’s anomaly. [396]

AVRT is the most common tachycardia associated with APs. Two
mechanisms of re-entry are possible according to the antegrade or

�
retrograde conduction over the AVN HPS, and are classified as

orthodromic and antidromic AVRT.

11.3.2 Wolff�Parkinson�White syndrome
WPW syndrome refers to the presence of an overt (manifest) AP,
thus resulting in the so-called pre-excitation, in combination with
usually recurrent tachyarrhythmias. [397] During sinus rhythm, a typical pattern in the resting ECG with the following characteristics is
present: (i) a short PR interval (<_120 ms); (ii) slurred upstroke (or

. [..................................................................]


QRS complex (>120 ms). In most cases, APs giving rise to the
WPW pattern are seen in structurally normal hearts. Rare, familial
forms of pre-excitation associated with LV hypertrophy and multisystem disease [mutations in the protein kinase adenosine
monophosphate-activated non-catalytic subunit gamma 2
(PRKAG2) gene, Danon and Fabry disease, and others] have also
been described. [398]

Several surface ECG algorithms have been developed that can be
applied for the localization of APs in the presence of overt preexcitation (Figures 16 and 17). [399][�][401] Pre-excitation on the surface
ECG can be intermittent and can even disappear permanently (in
<_35% of cases) over time. Furthermore, various degrees of preexcitation are possible depending on the location of the AP as well as
on AVN conduction properties.

11.3.3 Orthodromic atrioventricular re-entrant

tachycardia

Orthodromic AVRT accounts for >90% of AVRTs and for

20 - 30% of all sustained SVTs. The re-entrant impulse conducts

�
from the atrium to the ventricle through the AVN HPS, which is
the anterograde limb of the re-entrant circuit, whereas the AP

conducts from the ventricle to the atrium, and serves as the


Multiple APs occur in <_12% of patients with pre-excitation, and in
<_50% in patients with Ebstein’s anomaly. [396]

AVRT is the most common tachycardia associated with APs. Two
mechanisms of re-entry are possible according to the antegrade or

�
retrograde conduction over the AVN HPS, and are classified as

orthodromic and antidromic AVRT.


11.3.2 Wolff�Parkinson�White syndrome
WPW syndrome refers to the presence of an overt (manifest) AP,
thus resulting in the so-called pre-excitation, in combination with
usually recurrent tachyarrhythmias. [397] During sinus rhythm, a typical pattern in the resting ECG with the following characteristics is
present: (i) a short PR interval (<_120 ms); (ii) slurred upstroke (or
downstroke) of the QRS complex (‘delta wave’); and (iii) a wide

retrograde limb of the re-entrant circuit. Orthodromic
AVRT tends to be a rapid tachycardia, with frequencies
ranging from 150 to, rarely, >220 b.p.m. During tachycardia
(Figure 18), the following ECG features can be present: (i) RP
interval constant and, usually but not invariably, up to one-half of
the tachycardia CL; (ii) narrow QRS; (iii) functional BBB usually
associated with an AP ipsilateral to the blocked bundle, especially
in young patients (aged <40 years); and (iv) ST-segment
depression.

11.3.4 Antidromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia
Antidromic AVRT occurs in 3 - 8% of patients with WPW syndrome. [402][�][404] The re-entrant impulse travels from the atrium to
the ventricle through the AP with anterograde conduction; meanwhile, retrograde conduction occurs over the AVN or another
AP, usually located in a contralateral position to ensure longer
travel distances, thus allowing for sufficient recovery of refractoriness of the respective elements of the re-entrant circuit. In
30 - 60% of patients with spontaneous antidromic AVRT, multiple
APs (manifest or concealed), which could act or not as the retrograde limb during the AVRT, may be detected. Antidromic AVRT
has the following ECG features, illustrated in Figure 18: (i) a wide
QRS complex (fully pre-excited) and (ii) an RP interval that is . [.......................................................................]


difficult to assess as the retrograde P wave is usually inscribed
within the ST-T segment.

11.3.5 Accessory pathway as a bystander
In the presence of focal AT, atrial flutter, AF, or AVNRT, the QRS
complexes can be pre-excited when the AP acts as a bystander, and
is not a critical part of the re-entry circuit.

11.3.6 Pre-excited atrial fibrillation

Paroxysmal AF has been found in 50% of patients with WPW, and
may be the presenting arrhythmia in affected patients. [405][,][406]

These patients are typically young and have no structural heart
disease. High-rate AVRT may potentially initiate AF. AF with
fast ventricular response over an overt AP with a short anterograde refractory period is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia
in patients with WPW syndrome, due to potential degeneration

into VF.

11.3.7 Concealed accessory pathways
Concealed APs give rise only to orthodromic AVRT. Their true prevalence is unknown because they are not detectable on the resting
surface ECG, but only at occurrence of AVRT, or during electrophysiology testing. [45] No sex predilection is found and these pathways

tend to occur more frequently in younger patients than in those with
AVNRT; however, significant overlap exists. [3] Concealed APs are predominantly localized along the left free wall (64%), and less frequently
at septal (31%) and right free wall locations. [395] Clinical presentation
is with AVRT. Concealed pathways are not associated with an
increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The management of AVRT

due to a concealed AP is similar to that of an overt AP, but in this

case is related to symptoms without significant prognostic relevance

in most cases.

11.3.8 Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia
PJRT is a rare form of AV reciprocating tachycardia using a concealed
AP. Usually these APs, originally described by Coumel, are located in
the posteroseptal region and are associated with retrograde decremental conduction properties. [407] PJRT is a long RP tachycardia due
to the slow conduction properties of the AP, and is characterized by
deeply inverted retrograde P waves in leads II, III, and aVF due to the
retrograde nature of atrial activation. The incessant nature of PJRT
may result in TCM that usually resolves after successful treatment by
radiofrequency catheter ablation, particularly in younger
patients. [407][,][408] Catheter ablation is strongly recommended in symptomatic patients or in cases with impaired LV ejection fraction likely
related to TCM. . [........................................................................]


Other potential causes of long RP tachycardias are sinus tachycardia, AT, atypical AVRT, and JET with 1:1 retrograde conduction.

11.3.9 Atypical forms of pre-excitation
Other APs are postulated to result in cardiac pre-excitation. Atypical
APs (also called Mahaim fibers) are connections between the right
atrium or the AVN and the right ventricle, into or close to the right
bundle branch. [409][�][414] Most of them are atriofascicular or nodoven
tricular (as initially described), but they can also be atriofascicular,
atrioventricular, nodofascicular, or nodoventricular, depending on
their variable proximal and distal insertions. [413][,][414] Left-sided atypical
pathways have also been described but are extremely rare. [415][�][417]

Atypical pathways usually contain accessory nodal tissue, which
results in decremental properties, and connect the atrium to the fascicles by crossing the lateral aspect of the tricuspid annulus, but posteroseptal locations can also be found in rare cases. Conduction is
usually anterograde only, but concealed fibres have also been
described. [412][,][418] The following properties define the behaviour of
atypical pathways:

 - [Baseline normal QRS or different degrees of manifest pre-]
excitation with LBBB morphology;

 - [Programmed atrial pacing, leading to obvious manifest pre-]
excitation following an increase in AV interval along with shortening of the HV interval at shorter pacing CLs;

also occur, depending on the way of insertion into the right bundle and fusion over the left anterior fascicle.

Mapping identifies the proximal and distal insertion of accessory
fibres, and demonstrates pathway potentials in most cases that then
guide ablation. [409][,][411] Catheter ablation is associated with a high suc
cess rate and low recurrence rates, and is therefore recommended

for all patients with recurrent symptomatic tachycardia, and especially incessant tachycardias due to concealed nodofascicular or
nodoventricular pathways. [418] Preventive ablation for prognostic reasons is not routinely recommended, not even in patients with pre
excitation or BBB in the surface ECG, as fast conduction via the AP is

unlikely due to decremental conduction properties.

because of potential induction of fast AF. [119][,][120][,][272] AF with fast ventricular


conduction could also induce ventricular fibrillation, therefore electrical

cardioversion should always be available. During orthodromic and antidromic AVRT, drug therapy could be directed at one of the components
of the circuit, the AVN (beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, or etripamil), [100][,][129][,][419][,][420] or the AP (ibutilide, procainamide, propafenone, or flecainide) [421][,][422] (Figure 19). Antidromic AVRT is associated with malignant
WPW syndrome due to a very fast-conducting AP, [403] and drugs acting
mainly on the AP should be preferred. In addition, in case of antidromic
AVRT with APs representing both the anterograde and retrograde limb,
drugs acting on the AVN are ineffective. In drug-refractory antidromic
AVRT, amiodarone may also be considered. [423][�][425]

In patients presenting with pre-excited AF, urgent cardioversion is
usually required and the threshold for the use of electrical cardioversion is lower. Conduction of electrical impulses can occur preferentially via the AP due to its shorter RP compared with the AVN. [426]

Accordingly, any AVN-modulating agents (adenosine, verapamil, diltiazem, beta-blockers, or digoxin) should be avoided in pre-excited
AF as they may contribute to a risk of ventricular fibrillation. [427][,][428]

Pharmacological cardioversion of pre-excited AF or delayed AP conduction can be achieved with ibutilide (Figure 20). [421] Drugs such as
procainamide, propafenone, or flecainide, which affect conduction

over the AP, may also be used, even if they may not restore sinus
rhythm. [429][�][431] However, class Ic drugs should be used with caution
as they do exert an effect on the AVN. In pre-excited AF, i.v. amiodarone may not be as safe as previously thought, because enhanced
pathway conduction and ventricular fibrillation have been reported,
and should not be considered. [432][�][435] Procainamide appears to be
safer in this setting. [436]

11.3.10.2 Catheter ablation

The treatment of choice for patients with symptomatic and recurrent AVRT, or pre-excited AF, is catheter ablation (Figure 21). For
other patients with asymptomatic and infrequent episodes, therapeutic decisions should be balanced between the overall risks and
benefits of the invasive nature of ablation vs. long-term commitment to pharmacological therapy. Ablation of the AP has a high
acute success rate and is associated with a low complication rate
depending on the pathway location (Table 9). [391][�][393][,][438][�][440] Major

�
complications include cardiac tamponade (0.13 1.1%) and com
�
plete AV block (0.17 2.7%) in patients in whom ablation of septal
APs is attempted. With septal APs close to the AVN, the ECG typically displays a positive delta wave in leads avF and avL, and a narrow positive delta wave in lead V1 that has a prominently negative
QRS complex. [394]

When targeting septal pathways and applying cryoenergy, the incidence of AV block is lower compared with radiofrequency energy. [447]

However, recurrence of previously blocked pathways has been
reported to be significantly higher when cryoenergy is applied. [438]

Two approaches are available for left-sided pathways: an antegrade
transseptal and a retrograde aortic approach. There is evidence that
the transseptal approach, in experienced hands, results in reduced
radiation and procedure times. [441][,][448] . [.........................................................................................]


Figure 21 Chronic therapy of atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia.
AVRT = atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia.

The 2015 American College of Cardiology/American Heart
Association/Heart Rhythm Society Guideline for the Management
of Adult Patients With Supraventricular Tachycardia reported
major complication rates after radiofrequency catheter ablation
of 3.0 and 2.8% for AVNRT and AVRT, respectively. [2] These rates
are much higher than those reported by experienced electrophysiologists in the current era, as summarized in Table 9, but the
procedure still carries a very small, non-negligible, mortality
risk. [203][,][205]

11.3.10.3 Chronic therapy
If ablation is not desirable or feasible in patients with preexcitation and symptomatic antidromic AVRT, and in whom struc
tural or ischaemic heart disease has been excluded, class IC antiar
rhythmic drugs act mainly on the AP and can be used in
antidromic tachycardia (Figure 21). [429][,][437][,][444][,][445] In cases of pre
excited AF, caution should be taken not to transform it into atrial

flutter and induce 1:1 conduction. Apart from class IC drugs, betablockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may also be considered in case of
orthodromic tachycardias if no signs of pre-excitation are
observed on the resting ECG. [340][,][341][,][442][,][443]

11.3.11 The asymptomatic patient with pre-excitation
Most patients with an asymptomatic WPW pattern will go
through life without any clinical events related to their ventricular
pre-excitation. Approximately one in five patients will develop an
arrhythmia related to their AP during follow-up. The most common arrhythmia in patients with WPW syndrome is AVRT (80%),
followed by a 20�30% incidence of AF. Sudden cardiac death

ESC Guidelines 693


secondary to pre-excited AF that conducts rapidly to the ventricle
over the AP, resulting in ventricular fibrillation, is the most feared
manifestation of WPW syndrome. The risk of cardiac arrest/ventricular fibrillation has been estimated at 2.4 per 1000 person
�
years (95% confidence interval 1.3 3.9), but no deaths were
reported in a registry of 2169 patients over an 8 year follow-up
period. [439] However, in a Danish registry of 310 individuals with

�
pre-excitation (age range 8 85 years), there was a greater risk of
AF and HF, driven by a right anteroseptal AP, and in patients aged
>65 years there was also a statistically significant higher risk of
death. [22]

Clinical and electrophysiological features associated with an
increased risk of sudden cardiac death include younger
age, [439][,][449][,][450] inducibility of AV-reciprocating tachycardia during
EPS, [450][�][454] multiple APs, [450][,][451][,][455][,][456] and demonstration of a
capability of the AP to allow rapid conduction to the ventricles. [439][,][450][,][451,453][�][456] These variables include the shortest preexcited RR interval during AF (SPERRI) of <_250 ms at baseline or
a short antegrade effective refractory period (ERP) of the AP
(<_250 ms). [439,450][�][452,454][�][460] With non-invasive testing, identification of an abrupt and complete normalization of the PR interval
with loss of delta wave during exercise testing, or following procainamide, propafenone, or dispopyramide administration, has
been considered a marker of low risk. [459,461][�][463] Catecholamine
sensitivity is a major limiting factor of all tests, both invasive [452,460]

and non-invasive, including exercise testing. [459][,][461][,][462] Intermittent
loss of pre-excitation on a resting ECG or ambulatory monitoring
has also been associated with APs with longer ERPs, and has been
accepted as a credible risk-stratification tool. [2][,][464] However, a
number of recent studies, which have included both symptomatic
and asymptomatic patients, have indicated that more than onefifth of patients with intermittent pre-excitation have AP ERPs
<250 ms. Thus, intermittent pre-excitation is now recognized as
an imperfect marker of a low-risk AP. [406][,][462,465][�][469]

Over the past 30 years, a considerable body of literature has
been published that has focused on the important topic of the
evaluation and management of patients with asymptomatic preexcitation. These publications include those that describe the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of patients with preexcitation who have experienced a cardiac arrest, [439][,][451][,][455][,][459]

and series of patients with pre-excitation who are either symptomatic or asymptomatic, and are followed for variable periods of
time. [22][,][405][,][439][,][449][,][450][,][454][,][456][,][470][�][472] Among these studies, there has
been one prospective RCT of catheter ablation (37 patients) vs.
clinical follow-up without treatment (35 patients) of patients with
asymptomatic pre-excitation. [453] Catheter ablation reduced the
frequency of arrhythmic events (7 vs. 77%, P < 0.001) over 5 years.
One patient in the control group had an episode of cardioverted

ventricular fibrillation.

694 ESC Guidelines


Invasive screening with an EPS should be performed in patients
with asymptomatic pre-excitation who either have high-risk occupations or are competitive athletes (Figure 22). Variables on the EPS
that identify patients with a high-risk AP include a SPERRI <_250 ms,
AP ERP <_250 ms, multiple APs, and an inducible AP-mediated tachycardia in the baseline state or during isoproterenol infusion, which
should always be tried. [452][,][460] The options for screening patients who
do not fall into these groups include the use of EPS as a risk-stratifying

tool or the use of non-invasive screening with exercise testing, drug
testing, and ambulatory monitoring as risk-stratification tools.

If a patient undergoes screening with an EPS and is found to have
an AP with ‘high-risk’ characteristics, catheter ablation should be performed. Catheter ablation of an AP, when performed by an experienced operator, is associated with a high cure rate (>95%) and low
risk (<0.5%) of major complications (see also Section
11.1.2.3). [438][�][440] However, it should be noted that even invasive

High-risk features at electrophysiology study are shortest preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation <_250 ms, accessory pathway effective refractory period <_250 ms, multiple accessory pathways, and inducible

studies do not confer absolute certainty about risk assessment. In a
recent retrospective study in 912 young patients (aged <_21 years)
with WPW syndrome, 96 experienced life-threatening events, [405] of
whom 49% had rapidly conducted pre-excited AF. In patients with
events subjected to EPS risk stratification, 22 of 60 (37%) did not
have EPS-determined high-risk characteristics, and 15 of 60 (25%)
had neither concerning pathway characteristics nor inducible AVRT.
There has also been evidence supporting the notion of LV dysfunction related to electrical asynchrony in patients, especially children,
with asymptomatic pre-excitation. [478][�][481] It seems reasonable to recommend EPS and consider ablation if a link between pre-excitation
and LV dysfunction can be made.

Catheter ablation of an asymptomatic ‘low-risk’ AP also appears
reasonable in appropriately experienced centres according to
informed patient choice. However, when a decision is made to perform catheter ablation, it is important to recognise that ablation of
APs in the anteroseptal or mid-septal (MS) region is associated with a

small risk of AV block. The risk of heart block associated with ablation

of anteroseptal or MS APs may preclude ablation of an anteroseptal
or MS AP in an asymptomatic patient.
Thus, the approach for patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation
that does not exhibit high-risk characteristics at EPS depends on the
experience and expertise of the electrophysiologist performing the
procedure, as well as the preferences and values of the patient. In the
CASPED registry involving 182 children and adolescents with asymptomatic pre-excitation, catheter ablation achieved a 91% success rate
without significant complications. [482]
### 12 Supraventricular tachycardia in adults with congenital heart disease

The number of adults with congenital heart disease is increasing at a
rate of �60% per decade in developed countries. [483][,][484] Currently, it
is estimated that �1 million adults with congenital heart disease live
in the European Union. Despite ongoing advances in paediatric surgery and cardiology, allowing >90% of children born with congenital
heart disease to survive to adulthood, [485] these patients usually continue to be afflicted by late complications leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Alongside HF, cardiac arrhythmias are a
common late complication in adults with congenital heart defects. [486]

This is due to the underlying cardiac defect, previous or persisting
haemodynamic issues, and previous surgical interventions resulting in
myocardial damage and scarring. [487] Arrhythmic burden ranges from
bradycardia arrhythmias to SVTs, and life-threatening VTs or

fibrillation.

Owing to preceding operations and underlying anatomy, patients
with tetralogy of Fallot, Ebstein’s anomaly, transposition of the great
arteries after atrial switch procedure, and complex patients with univentricular hearts and Fontan palliation are especially prone to late

tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. [488] However, even patients
with usually non-complex lesions such as atrial septal defects have an
increased life risk of atrial arrhythmias.

In addition to being related to symptoms, SVTs have been
reported as risk factors for sudden cardiac death in patients with
ACHD. This issue particularly affects patients with obstructive lesions
of the systemic ventricle, tetralogy of Fallot, after Fontan operation,
and a systemic right ventricle. [489][,][490] Unfortunately, diagnosis and
treatment of arrhythmias in ACHD patients is complicated by the
unusual nature of tachycardia, complex intracardiac anatomy, and
especially by difficulties in accessing the heart, for example due to
abnormal venous anatomy (e.g. azygos continuity or previous Fontan
operation). As a consequence, specific expertise in patients with
ACHD and access to adequate electrophysiological tools are
required when performing catheter ablation procedures in these

patients.

12.1 Pharmacological antiarrhythmic
therapy
Acute therapy of SVT in the context of ACHD is as described for
narrow QRS SVT, in general. [491][,][492] Randomized controlled trials of
chronic antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with complex ACHD are
lacking. All antiarrhythmic drugs carry a proarrhythmic risk, and many
patients with ACHD have underlying sinus node dysfunction or a
predisposition for AVN disease. Antiarrhythmic drugs should therefore be used with particular caution, and are generally reserved for
symptomatic patients after options for catheter ablation procedures
and haemodynamic optimization (e.g. correction of underlying valvular problems) have been exhausted. Beta-blockers may be used to
slow AV nodal conduction and may be considered, with caution, in
patients with transposition of the great arteries after the atrial switch
operation. This is supported by studies reporting a reduction in ventricular fibrillation and/or appropriate ICD shocks in patients treated
with beta-blocking drugs. [493][,][494] However, care is needed as these
patients may suffer from chronotropic incompetence and cannot tolerate beta-blockade. [495] Owing to recognized pro-arrhythmic effects,
class IC drugs should be used with appropriate caution in the ACHD
setting. Similar considerations refer to quinidine, disopyramide, and
sotalol. In the recent report of the DARE study cohort, amiodarone,
flecainide, and sotalol were clearly found to be pro-arrhythmic, especially in the presence of a prolonged QT, in older women, and in
patients with underlying cardiovascular comorbidity, family history of
sudden death, and hypokalaemia. [496] Flecainide is highly effective in
infants with SVT, but there are concerns about its toxicity at older
ages. [496][,][497] Most centres have a lower threshold for the use of
amiodarone in patients with ACHD as it is perceived to be less proarrhythmic. However, it is commonly associated with thyroid disorders and less commonly with other well-described potentially
life-changing complications. These considerations should severely
limit its long-term use in patients with ACHD, thus further supporting the first-line use of ablation attempts wherever possible. [498]


Catheter ablation of an asymptomatic ‘low-risk’ AP also appears
reasonable in appropriately experienced centres according to
informed patient choice. However, when a decision is made to perform catheter ablation, it is important to recognise that ablation of
APs in the anteroseptal or mid-septal (MS) region is associated with a

small risk of AV block. The risk of heart block associated with ablation

of anteroseptal or MS APs may preclude ablation of an anteroseptal
or MS AP in an asymptomatic patient.
Thus, the approach for patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation
that does not exhibit high-risk characteristics at EPS depends on the
experience and expertise of the electrophysiologist performing the
procedure, as well as the preferences and values of the patient. In the
CASPED registry involving 182 children and adolescents with asymptomatic pre-excitation, catheter ablation achieved a 91% success rate
without significant complications. [482]

The number of adults with congenital heart disease is increasing at a

12.2 Catheter and surgical ablation
Owing to underlying anatomy and previous operations, interventional
access for ablation procedures may be challenging in patients with
ACHD. In addition, the nature of SVT is often atypical, and related to
multiple re-entrant circuits and fibrotic atrial tissue. As a consequence,
special expertise and experience with ablation of complex tachyarrhythmias and scar-related procedures are necessary. [506] It is recommended
that patients with complex incisional tachycardias are referred to specialist centres with adequate experience, volumes of ablation procedures, and advanced mapping capabilities. Catheter ablation procedures
in the setting of ACHD are associated with lower success rates compared with the general cohort of patients with AF or atrial flutter. [484]

However, ablation of CTI-related arrhythmias has been reported to
have a high acute success rate (>95%), although the mid-term recurrence rate may approach 20%. [507] Pre-operative catheter ablation or
concomitant arrhythmia surgery should be considered in patients with
ACHD undergoing cardiac surgery, as its incorporation can result in
improved functional class and potentially decreased requirements for

12.3.1 Atrial septal defect

mechanism is CTI-dependent tachycardia and this is generally susceptible to catheter ablation. However, CTI-dependent and ‘incisional’ atrial
flutter may coexist. Closure of an existing atrial septal defect, in isolation, is generally insufficient to abolish an existing AT and catheter abla
tion should be considered before defect closure. Mid-term recurrence

rates of 40�44% have been reported in atrial septal defect patients
post-flutter or AF ablation [508][,][509] ; however, this should not preclude
ablation procedures wherever possible.

12.3.2 Ebstein’s anomaly
ATs are common in Ebstein’s anomaly, occurring in 25�65% of
patients. [501][,][510][�][512] The types of arrhythmia include atrial flutter, focal AT,

�
and AF. In addition, 10 45% of patients have right-sided APs, including
WPW syndrome. More than one AP is common in this setting, and can in
itself increase the risk of haemodynamic compromise and sudden cardiac
death. Catheter ablation of APs has a high success rate; however, ablation
procedures may be challenging and repeat procedures may be necessary
as some patients have multiple ablation targets. In addition, patients may
develop different arrhythmia mechanisms following ablation. [501] In patients
undergoing surgical repair, routine pre-operative EPS can be recommended as the diagnostic and therapeutic yield in this population is high. [513]

12.3.3 Transposition of the great arteries (dextrotransposition of the great arteries) after atrial switch
operation (Mustard or Senning)
Owing to previous surgery and scarring, atrial re-entrant tachycardias
are common in patients with a Mustard or Senning repair. In addition,


However, ablation of CTI-related arrhythmias has been reported to
have a high acute success rate (>95%), although the mid-term recurrence rate may approach 20%. [507] Pre-operative catheter ablation or
concomitant arrhythmia surgery should be considered in patients with
ACHD undergoing cardiac surgery, as its incorporation can result in
improved functional class and potentially decreased requirements for
chronic antiarrhythmic medication in this vulnerable population. [502][�][504]

sinus node dysfunction may occur as a consequence of the atrial redirection procedure. [495] As tachycardia is not well tolerated in patients
with asystemic right ventricular and diastolic dysfunction, maintaining
long-term sinus rhythm is highly desirable in this setting. Use of antiarrhythmic drugs is limited due to ventricular and sinus node dysfunction,
and pro-arrhythmic risk. Ablation procedures in patients with a
Mustard or Senning repair have a high acute success rate; however,
recurrence rates approach 30% during long-term follow-up. [500][,][514][�][516]

12.3.4 Tetralogy of Fallot
SVTs are not uncommon in patients with tetralogy of Fallot. In addition to
being related to symptoms, the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias has been linked to a statistically higher risk of sudden cardiac death in
this population. [517] As catheter ablation has a high procedural success rate,
it should be considered as a first-line option in this setting. [518] In addition,
patients with new-onset atrial arrhythmias should be thoroughly evaluated to exclude addressable haemodynamic lesions such as severe pulmonary valve regurgitation, which may be amenable to surgical or
interventional therapy leading indirectly to reduced arrhythmia burden.

12.3.5 Fontan repairs
AT is common in patients post-Fontan palliation. Patients with a classic
(atriopulmonary) Fontan procedure are at especially high risk for AT,
with <_60% developing SVTs after 15 years of follow-up. [519] In addition to
symptoms and the risk of cardiac thromboembolism, AT is poorly tolerated haemodynamically in patients with univentricular hearts, and may
lead to acute deterioration and overt HF in this setting. [520] Catheter ablation is often effective but challenging, due to the nature of the arrhythmia
circuits as well as issues with cardiac access. [514][,][515] Various surgical modifications, such as the conversion to total cavopulmonary connection,
have evolved and can ameliorate the risk of atrial arrhythmias. [521]
### 13 Supraventricular tachycardia in the paediatric population

Specific detailed recommendations for paediatric patients are published elsewhere [522][,][523] and are beyond the scope of this document.
In general, certain aspects are different in the paediatric population

and should be taken into account.

Immaturity of the cardiac structures, including conduction tissue,
may lead to modifications in the electrophysiology of the heart.
Therefore, some APs present in the first months of life (even those
associated with tachycardias) may disappear before the first year of
age. [522] Actually, AVRT due to WPW that begins in infancy may
resolve in �90% of patients, but may recur in later childhood in
30- 50% of patients; however, if the tachycardia is present after the
age of 5, it persists in >75% of patients. [524]

It is clear that small children may not complain of symptoms, so
indirect signs have to be assessed when SVT is suspected, i.e. irritability, failure to thrive, and even flat growing curves. It is not uncommon
to discover an incessant SVT in a patient presenting with cardiogenic
shock due to TCM. This most frequently occurs in relatively slow
SVTs, such as PJRT and focal AT. [525][,][526]

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in children are different
to those in adults; therefore, special attention has to be given when

milk can substantially modify the absorption of the drug and, as feeding schedules tend to be erratic, can affect effective drug availability.
Furthermore, many drugs have to be prepared at specialized pharmacies, adding to the risk of incorrect dosing, and drug solutions may
also need to be stored under special conditions to maintain their
stability. This can be inconvenient when long-term treatment is
required as, for example, a portable cooler bag must be carried. In
addition, the long-term effects of some drugs, as they accumulate, are
especially dangerous in growing bodies. This is of special interest
regarding amiodarone, which can chronically provoke the same secondary effects as it does in adults. Verapamil has to be avoided whenever possible or given very carefully to small patients as it can
provoke severe hypotension. [522] A decreased response of adenosine
in younger children has also been suggested. [528]

Invasive techniques are possible and effective even in very small
children, when indicated, but there are several limiting factors. First,
radiofrequency lesion formation in immature sheep myocardium is
similar to that in adult sheep myocardium acutely, but is associated
with late lesion enlargement and fibrous tissue invasion of normal
myocardium. These observations may have implications for clinical
radiofrequency ablation procedures in infants [529] and avoidance of
radiofrequency ablation, if at all possible, in the first 2 years of life is
prudent. Second, no specific catheters and tools exist for the paediatric population. Currently, available catheters (minimum 5 French for
non-irrigated radiofrequency tips) and curves are, in general, too
large. This is particularly limiting in small children needing an ablation
to resolve incessant tachycardia. Finally, the experience of the operator and the centre is crucial. Small patients requiring ablation should
be referred to experienced reference centres for treatment. The
number of catheters used, and procedural and radiation times, should
be minimized in these growing bodies. [530] Electroanatomical mapping
systems are most valuable in this setting.

13.1 Foetal arrhythmias
Foetal arrhythmias can be detected at an early gestational age, with
incessant, rapid SVTs associated with foetal death due to hydrops.
Therefore, a special effort has to be made to detect and control foetal
arrhythmias. A strong correlation between post-natal SVT and later gestational age at foetal SVT diagnosis has been reported. [531] Diagnosis
relies on echocardiography as foetal ECGs are not available in most clinics (it is used in just a few centres worldwide and primarily for research
purposes). [532] When sustained foetal tachycardia is observed, treatment
is mandated. There are several protocols for this purpose, and they are
mostly based on digoxin, flecainide, and sotalol alone or in combination
depending on the type of tachycardia. These drugs have to be given to
the mother, with a fraction reaching the foetus. This means that the secondary effects of these drugs can manifest in both the foetus and
mother. Close follow-up is therefore needed. [522][,][533][,][534]
### 14 Supraventricular tachycardia in pregnancy

Sustained SVT becomes more frequent during pregnancy, occurring
in 22�24/100000 pregnancies. It may even manifest for the first
time, particularly in the third trimester or peri-partum, according to
comprehensive discharge data from hospitals. [535] The overall

(199/100 000) than in those aged 18 30 years (55/100 000), which
may be due to more prevalent AF and VT, whereas SVT seems stable
over time. [535] Arrhythmias are also more frequent among women
with congenital heart disease, particularly atrial flutter, compared
with women without congenital defects. [536]

As substantive prospective or randomized studies are unavailable,
recommendations are primarily based on small cohorts or case
reports in conjunction with expert opinion.

14.1 Maternal, obstetric, and offspring
risk

SVT is associated with an increased risk of death during pregnancy,
and the reported frequency is 68 per 100 000 pregnancy-related hospitalizations for any arrhythmia, 22 per 100000 for SVT, 4 per
100 000 for atrial flutter, 27 per 100 000 for AF, 2 per 100 000 for
ventricular fibrillation, and 16 per 100 000 for VT. [535]

Identification and treatment of underlying conditions are the first
priorities. Although most of the exacerbations of SVT during pregnancy are benign and can be treated effectively with standard medical
therapy, [537] the circumstances that should be considered include the
well-being of the foetus and the effects on labour, delivery, and lactation. The haemodynamic effect of tachycardia, as well as side effects

of treatments, must be balanced and addressed for the foetus.

Catheter ablation should therefore be considered before pregnancy
when possible in patients with a known history of symptomatic
tachyarrhythmia. Trials evaluating the level of surveillance at delivery
are needed. . [........................................................................................]

14.2 Therapy
14.2.1 Antiarrhythmic drugs
Treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs for the prevention of SVT
should, in general, be reserved for SVTs causing haemodynamic compromise or significant symptoms. The major concern regarding the
use of antiarrhythmic drugs during pregnancy is potential adverse

effects on the foetus. While the first trimester is associated with the

greatest teratogenic risk, drug exposure later in pregnancy may result
in adverse effects on foetal growth and development, and on uterine
contractility, and an increased risk of pro-arrhythmia. The risks and
benefits of continuing vs. stopping medication must be carefully considered in terms of the risk of recurring SVT, and the potential for
haemodynamic compromise. Decisions should be individualized,
based on the clinical situation and possible additional structural heart
disease. Major controlled studies of antiarrhythmic drugs during pregnancy are lacking. If non-invasive manoeuvres fail, adenosine should
be the first-line drug for treatment if needed during the second and
third trimesters. There is a paucity of data on management of SVT in
the first trimester. [542] All beta-blockers can cause bradycardia and
hypoglycaemia in the foetus. As beta-1 selective beta-blockers are
less likely to affect uterine relaxation, they are preferred. [546] Maternal

use of beta-blockers in the first trimester has not been associated

with a large increase in the risk for overall or cardiac malformations. [548][,][553] However, in the EUROmediCAT study, an association
between alpha/beta-adrenergic blocker use in the first trimester with
multicystic renal dysplasia was reported. [554] There have been concerns about ‘low weight for gestational age’ with beta-blockers,
although the effects reported may not be large enough to be of clinical importance. Exposure to atenolol has been associated with a

15.3 Diagnosis
TCM is one of the very few reversible causes of HF and dilated cardiomyopathy, and should be considered in any patient with new onset
of LV dysfunction. In the presence of persistent or frequent tachycardia, or frequent premature ventricular contractions, a high index of
suspicion should be maintained. The diagnosis is established by
excluding other causes of cardiomyopathy, and demonstrating recovery of LV function after eradication of the arrhythmia or control of
the ventricular rate. Typically in TCM, LV ejection fraction is <30%,
LV end-diastolic diameter is <65 mm, and LV end-systolic diameter is
<50 mm. [557] More dilated ventricular volumes suggest underlying
dilated cardiomyopathy, although some overlapping of the two conditions can occur. In patients with suspected TCM, cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) is advisable to exclude intrinsic structural change.
Serial assessment of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) and estimation of the ratio of NT-proBNP at baseline to
NT-proBNP during follow-up can help differentiate TCM from irreversible idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.

14.2.3 Catheter ablation

Catheter ablation should be postponed to the second trimester if
possible, but may be necessary in the case of drug-refractory and
poorly tolerated tachycardia. It should then be performed at an experienced centre using non-fluoroscopic electroanatomical mapping
and catheter navigation systems. [556] Catheter ablation of recurrent,
drug-refractory AVNRT, AVRT, focal AT, and CTI-dependent atrial
flutter has been successful during pregnancy. [550][�][552]

### 15 Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy

15.1 Definition

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TCM), or more accurately
arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy, is a reversible cause of impaired
LV function due to persistent tachycardia or very frequent ventricular
premature beats that can lead to HF and death. The incidence of
TCM is unknown but has been reported in all age groups, from foetuses to the elderly.

15.2 Mechanism

The syndrome was initially described with PJRT, but we now know
that any chronic cardiac arrhythmia may cause TCM. Incessant
AVRTs due to septal APs, rapid AF, idiopathic VT, AT, and persistent
ectopic beats are best described. [196][,][233][,][526][,][557][�][563] In patients aged
<18 years, focal AT is the commonest cause. [408]

Rapid pacing in animal models induces cytoskeletal changes and
remodelling of the extracellular matrix attributed to abnormal calcium cycling, increased catecholamines, decreased beta-1 adrenergic
receptor density, oxidative stress, depletion of myocardial energy
stores, and myocardial ischaemia due to increased heart rate. [559][,][564]

Endomyocardial biopsy specimens from patients with TCM exhibit
features distinct from those of other types of cardiomyopathy,
including deranged cardiomyocyte and mitochondrial morphology,
and macrophage-dominated cardiac inflammation. [565] However, it has
not been fully established how the majority of patients with frequent
premature ventricular contractions have a benign course, whereas
<_30% of them may develop cardiomyopathy. [566]

In TCM, LV function frequently improves after �3 months of

with either biventricular or His-bundle pacing is appropriate. [569][�][572]

Long-term medical therapy with beta-blockers, and angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, is

indicated before and after successful ablation for the known beneficial

effects of these drugs on the LV remodelling process. Given the risk
of recurrence of arrhythmias, long-term monitoring of patients is

recommended.
### 16 Supraventricular tachycardia in sports

Athletes with frequent supraventricular arrhythmias should be
assessed to exclude the presence of an underlying cardiac disease,
electrolyte imbalance, thyroid dysfunction, and the use of stimulants
or performance-enhancing drugs. Table 13 outlines the recommendations for sports eligibility of patients with SVT. [573][,][574]

Ventricular pre-excitation (WPW syndrome) is a rare cause of
sudden cardiac death in young athletes. [575] Although many individuals with ventricular pre-excitation remain asymptomatic
throughout their lives, symptomatic AVRT may occur. Patients
with WPW may also develop other arrhythmias, such as AF, which
could degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac
death. Because sports activity has been associated with an
increased risk of AF, [576] athletes with ventricular pre-excitation

have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death if the AP has the

potential for fast antegrade conduction. Thus, catheter ablation of
the AP is currently recommended in symptomatic athletes with
ventricular pre-excitation. Asymptomatic athletes with intermittent pre-excitation (at rest or during exercise) or abrupt disappearance of pre-excitation during stress testing may be
considered to be at low risk (see section 11.3.11 for reservations),
but should be further evaluated as they may be eligible for competitive sports activity. In asymptomatic athletes with ventricular
pre-excitation, invasive risk stratification should be conducted as
described in section 11.3.11 and catheter ablation should be . [.............................................................................................................]


performed in those with high-risk features. [577] Asymptomatic
patients stratified at low risk are allowed to practice competitive

sports.

AVNRT, orthodromic AVRT over a concealed AP, and AT are

not listed among the causes of sudden cardiac death during exercise in patients with a structurally normal heart. However, their
occurrence during sports activity may be associated with very high
heart rate because of sympathetic stimulation and may cause haemodynamic impairment even in patients with structurally normal
hearts. Accordingly, catheter ablation should generally be recommended for all athletes with a history of paroxysmal SVT. Athletes
with SVT who do not wish to undergo catheter ablation, or in
whom the procedure has been unsuccessful, may be considered
eligible for competitive sports activity if the arrhythmia is sporadic,

unrelated to cardiac disease, well tolerated, and unrelated to

exercise, and when the sports activity does not have a high intrinsic risk of loss of consciousness (such as divers, pilots, horse
riders, etc.). [578]

Treatment of paroxysmal SVT with beta-blockers or sodium channel blockers is discouraged in athletes, because these drugs may
reduce performance during sports and have limited ability to prevent
arrhythmia recurrence during sports activity. Moreover, betablockers are listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as prohibited
drugs in particular sports.
### 17 Supraventricular tachycardia and driving restrictions

The frequency of which medical causes contribute to motor vehicle
accidents is not precisely known. Data on arrhythmias as a cause of
motor vehicle accidents are hard to obtain due to the difficulty of
documenting such events in the general population. However, the
proportion is believed to be small, with �1 - 3% of all motor vehicle
accidents established as being due to a driver’s sudden incapacitation. [579] Of these accidents, 5 - 10% are related to cardiac causes, with


Long-term medical therapy with beta-blockers, and angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, is

effects of these drugs on the LV remodelling process. Given the risk

recommended.

In 2013, a Working Group of the ESC published detailed recommendations on driving restriction in patients with SVT (Table 14). [580]

Two groups of drivers are considered. Group 1 comprises drivers of
motorcycles, cars, and other small vehicles with and without a trailer.
Group 2 includes drivers of vehicles over 3500 kg or passengercarrying vehicles exceeding eight seats excluding the driver. Drivers

of taxicabs, small ambulances, and other vehicles form an intermedi

### 21 Areas for further research

With the advent of catheter ablation in the 1990s, resulting in the
successful elimination of APs in symptomatic patients, AVRT now
represents <20% of all SVTs. [11][,][13] The frequency of AVNRT, which
used to account for 50% of all SVT cases, [14] has changed to
�30%, [11][,][13] and the proliferation of AF ablation will unavoidably result
in more iatrogenic left atrial MRAT. Moreover, the prolonged survival
of paediatric and ACHD patients is expected to impose a further
challenge on electrophysiologists, who will encounter even more
complex MRATs. Several important advances in the field of anatomical and electrical mapping, as well as our appreciation of scar tissue
and the transmurality of ablation lesions, should improve our efficiency in treating these patients.

The past decade has witnessed a rapid evolution of ablation equipment and electrode-guiding systems, which has resulted in more controllable and safer procedures. Intracardiac echocardiography, robotic
techniques, and sophisticated anatomical navigation systems have
been developed, and it is now possible to perform ablation without
exposing the operator to radiation and ergonomically unfavourable
positions. [581] New materials for electrodes and other equipment have
allowed the concept of a radiation-free electrophysiology laboratory
with the use of CMR. The vision of a fully radiation-free, magnetic laboratory in the future is not science fiction anymore. [582]

The revolution in computer technology offers not only improved
mapping and electrode-moving systems, but also the enhancement of
specific SVT classification schemes with fully automated algorithms
that may greatly assist emergency departments, ambulances, and
monitored patients. [583] Mathematical modelling and numerical analyses have also been employed in the investigation of the circuit of
AVNRT. [317][,][329] Further analysis of recorded ECGs using fast Fourier
and Gaussian models may also provide useful diagnostic information
about the nature of the tachycardia. Novel electroanatomical mapping systems are being developed to assist the identification of the
tachycardia mechanism and optimal ablation site of SVT, and, especially, complex atrial macro-re-entrant tachycardias, with reduced fluoroscopy times. [584][�][589] Systems are now available that allow the
simultaneous visualization of activation and voltage. The implications
that these may have on characterizing the tachycardia substrate, and
not just the circuit, require future research.

New data on the genetics of SVT continually appear since the identification of a missense mutation in the PRKAG2 gene, which encodes the
regulatory c-subunit of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated
protein kinase, as a cause of familial WPW syndrome. [590][,][591] The
R302Q mutation in PRKAG2 has been associated with Mahaim fibers. [592]

A novel form of WPW syndrome is associated with microdeletion of
the BMP2 gene, which encodes bone morphogenetic protein-2, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta gene superfamily, and affects
the development of annulus fibrosus. [593] Other rare, genetic forms of
pre-excitation have also been described. [398] Whether this kind of
genetic predisposition translates into a higher ventricular fibrillation risk
remains to be seen. Genetic animal models of WPW that express mutations (such as of the gene encoding the AMP-activated protein kinase)
responsible for a familial form of WPW syndrome with a phenotype
identical to that of the human syndrome have been developed, and may
provide insight into the development and properties of the cardiac conduction system and APs. [594] Spontaneous AVNRT has also been . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


identified as a potential first clinical manifestation of concealed Brugada
syndrome, particularly in female patients. [595] It has been postulated that
genetic variants that reduce the sodium current may predispose individuals to expression of both phenotypes. Cellular electrophysiology is
now being integrated into genetic analysis. The coupling of wholeexome sequencing with cellular electrophysiological functional analysis
may elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanism responsible
for certain phenotypes. [596] Recently, a familial form of IST was shown to
be associated with a gain-of-function mutation in the HCN4 pacemaker
channel (R524Q), conferring an increased sensitivity to the second messenger cyclic AMP, which is a key mediator in sympathetic modulation. [597] These developments may have important implications for a
more specific diagnostic and personalized therapeutic approach in SVT.
Future research should define actionable patient-specific molecular
arrhythmia mechanisms, clarify the responses of the underlying substrates to interventions, and achieve selective supraventricular targeting
of specific arrhythmic mechanisms with drugs.

SVTs are not only an everyday clinical problem, with AVNRT being
the most common regular arrhythmia in humans. They also provide
the background for proper training of future electrophysiologists by
means of their well-defined circuits, in most cases, and predictable
responses in the electrophysiology laboratory. In the era of computerized approaches that are now available for AF, complex AT, and
VT ablation, this is very important for a rational, Aristotelian
approach to the art of medicine. [598]
