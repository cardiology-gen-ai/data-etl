### 1. Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in selecting the best management strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines and
their recommendations should facilitate decision making of health professionals in their daily practice. However, the final decisions concerning
an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), as well as by other societies and organisations. Because of the impact on clinical practice,
quality criteria for the development of guidelines have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC Guidelines can be
[found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writ](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
[ing-ESC-Guidelines). ESC Guidelines represent the official position of](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines-&-Education/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Guidelines-development/Writing-ESC-Guidelines)
the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.
Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC, including
representation from its relevant ESC sub-specialty groups, in order
to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients
with this pathology. Selected experts in the field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for management of a
given condition according to ESC Committee for Practice Guidelines
(CPG) policy. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the risk–benefit
ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation
of particular management options were weighed and graded according to predefined scales, as outlined in Tables 1 and 2.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. These forms were
[compiled into one file and can be found on the ESC website (http://](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[www.escardio.org/guidelines). Any changes in declarations of interest](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC and
updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from
the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
Guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement
process of these Guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive
review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions
the Guidelines are approved by all the experts involved in the Task
Force. The finalized document is approved by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The Guidelines were developed
after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge
and the evidence available at the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation of
educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary slides,
booklets with essential messages, summary cards for non-specialists
and an electronic version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.).

ESC Guidelines 1887



![Page 10 Images](Syncope_2018_images/page_010_images.png)



These versions are abridged and thus, if needed, one should always
refer to the full-text version, which is freely available via the ESC website and hosted on the EHJ website. The National Societies of the ESC
are encouraged to endorse, translate and implement all ESC
Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed because it has
been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced
by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Surveys and registries are needed to verify that real-life daily practice is in keeping with what is recommended in the guidelines, thus
completing the loop between clinical research, writing of guidelines,
disseminating them and implementing them into clinical practice.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines fully
into account when exercising their clinical judgment, as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC Guidelines do not
override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of health


patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It
is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and
regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.
### 2. Introduction

The first ESC Guidelines for the management of syncope were published in 2001, with subsequent versions in 2004 and 2009. In March
2015, the ESC CPG considered that there were enough new data to
justify the production of new Guidelines.
The most important aspect characterizing this document is the
composition of the Task Force, which is truly multidisciplinary.
Cardiologists form a minority of the panel; experts in emergency
medicine, internal medicine and physiology, neurology and autonomic diseases, geriatric medicine, and nursing cover all aspects of
management of the various forms of syncope and transient loss of
consciousness (TLOC).

1888 ESC Guidelines


Compared with the previous versions of these Guidelines, the
[2018 document contains Supplementary Data as an integral part.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
While the print text mainly aims to give formal evidence-based recommendations according to the standardized rules of the ESC, this
new web-only feature allows expansion of the content to practical
issues, and aims to fill the gap between the best available scientific evidence and the need for dissemination of these concepts into clinical
practice (‘We have the knowledge, we need to teach it’). Thanks to the

[and thanks to the Web Practical Instructions advice is given on how](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
to evaluate patients with loss of consciousness (LOC), and how to
perform and interpret tests properly; whenever possible, we provide


The document aims to be patient-orientated and focused on therapy, and to reduce the risk of recurrence and the life-threatening
consequences of syncope recurrence. For this purpose, even in the
absence of strong evidence from trials, we give as much advice as
possible on the most appropriate therapy based on the practical expertise of the members of the Task Force (‘Our patients seek solutions,
not only explanations’). When possible, we provide therapeutic and
decision-making algorithms.
Finally, we recognize that one major challenge in syncope management is the reduction of inappropriate admissions and inappropriate
use of tests while maintaining the safety of the patient. We give strong
focus to pathways and organizational issues (‘We have the knowledge;
we need to apply it’). In particular, we propose a care pathway for the


ESC Guidelines 1889


management of patients with TLOC from their arrival in the emergency department (ED), and give practical instructions on how to set
up outpatient syncope clinics (syncope units) aimed at reducing hospitalization, under- and misdiagnoses, and costs.

2.1 What is new in the 2018 version?

The changes in recommendations made in the 2018 version compared with the 2009 version, the new recommendations, and the
most important new/revised concepts are summarized in Figure 1.
### 3. Definitions, classification, and pathophysiology

3.1 Definitions

 - [Syncope][ is defined as TLOC due to cerebral hypoperfusion, char-]
acterized by a rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery.

Syncope shares many clinical features with other disorders; it



 - [TLOC][ is defined as a state of real or apparent LOC with loss of]
awareness, characterized by amnesia for the period of unconsciousness, abnormal motor control, loss of responsiveness, and
a short duration.

The two main groups of TLOC are ‘TLOC due to head trauma’
and ‘non-traumatic TLOC’ (Figure 2). Traumatic TLOC will not be

considered further in this document, so TLOC will be used to mean

non-traumatic TLOC.

The clinical features characterizing TLOC are usually derived from history taking from patients and eyewitnesses. Specific characteristics that
[aid diagnosis are outlined in section 3 of the Web Practical Instructions.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
TLOC groups are defined using pathophysiology: the qualifying criterion for syncope is cerebral hypoperfusion; for epileptic seizures, it
is abnormal excessive brain activity; and for psychogenic TLOC it is
the psychological process of conversion. The syncope definition rests
on pathophysiology because no set of clinical features encompasses
all forms of syncope while also excluding all epileptic seizures and
psychogenic TLOC events.

 - [The adjective][ presyncope][ is used to indicate symptoms and signs]
that occur before unconsciousness in syncope. Note that the
noun presyncope is often used to describe a state that resembles
the prodrome of syncope, but which is not followed by LOC.

### 3. Definitions, classification, and pathophysiology


3.1 Definitions



- [Syncope][ is defined as TLOC due to cerebral hypoperfusion, char-]
acterized by a rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery.


Syncope shares many clinical features with other disorders; it
therefore presents in many differential diagnoses. This group of dis
orders is labelled TLOC.

1890 ESC Guidelines





A variety of terms are used that generally do not match the definitions
in this document closely enough to be used as synonyms of the defined
terms. For example, a ‘faint’ approximately conforms to syncope but
emphasizes vasovagal syncope (VVS) over other forms. A glossary of un
[certain terms is shown in section 1 of the Web Practical Instructions.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

3.2 Classification and pathophysiology of
syncope and transient loss of
consciousness

3.2.1 Syncope
Table 3 provides a classification of the principal causes of syncope,
emphasizing groups of disorders with common pathophysiology,
presentation, and risk. Clinical features, epidemiology, prognosis, impact on quality of life, and economic issues are shown in section 2 of

[the Web Practical Instructions.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

The pathophysiological classification centres on a fall in systemic
blood pressure (BP) with a decrease in global cerebral blood flow as
the defining characteristic of syncope. Figure 3 shows low BP and global cerebral hypoperfusion as the central final common pathway of
syncope. A sudden cessation of cerebral blood flow for as short as
6–8 s can cause complete LOC. A systolic BP of 50–60 mmHg at
heart level, i.e. 30–45 mmHg at brain level in the upright position, will
cause LOC. [8][,][9]

Systemic BP is the product of cardiac output and total peripheral
resistance; a fall in either can cause syncope. However, in syncope,
both mechanisms often act together to a varying degree.
There are three primary causes of a low total peripheral resistance. The first is decreased reflex activity causing vasodilatation


‘vasodepressive type’ of reflex syncope, seen in the outer ring in
Figure 3. The second is a functional impairment, and the third a structural impairment of the autonomic nervous system, with druginduced, primary, and secondary autonomic failure in the outer ring.
In autonomic failure, there is insufficient sympathetic vasoconstriction
in response to the upright position.
There are four primary causes of low cardiac output. The first is
a reflex bradycardia, known as cardioinhibitory reflex syncope.
The second concerns cardiovascular causes: arrhythmia, structural disease including pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary
hypertension. The third is inadequate venous return due to volume depletion or venous pooling. Finally, chronotropic and inotropic incompetence through autonomic failure may impair
cardiac output.
Note that these primary mechanisms may interact in different
ways: firstly, venous pooling and inadequate venous return is also a
factor that can trigger an inappropriate reflex in orthostatic reflex
syncope; secondly, a low total peripheral resistance may cause venous pooling of blood below the diaphragm, in turn decreasing venous
return and consequently cardiac output.
The three main groups of syncope, i.e. reflex, cardiovascular, and
secondary to orthostatic hypotension (OH), are shown outside the
rings in Figure 3. Both reflex syncope and OH span the two main
pathophysiological mechanisms.

3.2.2 Non-syncopal forms of (real or apparent) transient

loss of consciousness

Only those forms of epilepsy in which normal motor control is lost,
so patients may fall, are included in Figure 2. These are tonic, clonic,

ESC Guidelines 1891



![Page 30 Images](Syncope_2018_images/page_030_images.png)












1892 ESC Guidelines






tonic-clonic, and atonic generalized seizures, and can be classified as
primary or secondary. The forms of epilepsy in which people remain
actively upright, i.e. sitting or standing (e.g. complex partial seizures
or absence epilepsy) are not regarded as TLOC, but sometimes they
are incorrectly diagnosed as syncope.
Psychogenic TLOC consists of two forms: one resembles epileptic
seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures [PNES]) and one, without gross movements, resembles syncope (psychogenic pseudosyncope [PPS]).
The rare causes of TLOC only seldomly cause confusion with the
main TLOC forms, probably because in most cases they differ
enough clinically to be clearly not syncope. Both vertebrobasilar transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and subclavian steal syndrome are
associated with focal neurological signs. A subarachnoid haemorrhage may present with a short LOC, but the associated abrupt extreme headache suggests the cause. In cyanotic breath-holding spells,
expiratory apnoea with hypoxia is the primary mechanism. [10] Socalled ‘pallid breath-holding spells’ in children do not constitute a primary respiratory problem, but are cardioinhibitory reflex syncope. [11]

Table 4 lists the main features that distinguish syncope from disorders that may be mistaken for syncope.
### 4. Diagnostic evaluation and management according to risk stratification

4.1 Initial evaluation

The clinical features characterizing TLOC are usually derived from history taking from patients and eyewitnesses. When a patient first presents






|Condition|Characteristic features that distin-<br>guish from syncope|
|---|---|
|Generalized seizures|See section 8, Table 10.|
|Complex partial seiz-<br>ures, absence epilepsy|No falls, yet unresponsive and later<br>amnesia|
|PPS or<br>“pseudocoma”|Duration of apparent LOC<br>lasting many minutes to hours; high<br>frequency, up to several times a day|
|Falls without TLOC|No unresponsiveness or amnesia|
|Cataplexy|Falls with flaccid paralysis and non-<br>responsive, yet no later amnesia|
|Intracerebral or sub-<br>arachnoid<br>haemorrhage|Consciousness may be progressively<br>reduced rather than immediately<br>lost. Accompanying severe head-<br>ache, other neurological signs|
|Vertebrobasilar TIA|Always focal neurological signs and<br>symptoms, usually without LOC; if<br>consciousness is lost this usually lasts<br>longer than in TLOC.|
|Carotid TIA|Consciousness is for all practical<br>purposes not lost in carotid TIAs,<br>but there are pronounced focal<br>neurological signs and symptoms|
|Subclavian steal<br>syndrome|Associated with focal neurological<br>signs|
|Metabolic disorders<br>including hypogly-<br>caemia, hypoxia,<br>hyperventilation with<br>hypocapnia|Duration much longer than in<br>TLOC; consciousness may be im-<br>paired instead of lost|
|Intoxication|Duration much longer than in<br>TLOC; consciousness may be im-<br>paired instead of lost|
|Cardiac arrest|LOC yet no spontaneous recovery|
|Coma|Duration much longer than TLOC|





with possible TLOC, history taking should first establish whether there
was indeed a TLOC. Often, this allows a distinction between the major
TLOC groups. The flow diagram for the evaluation of TLOC is shown in
Figure 4. The initial evaluation should answer key questions:

(1) Was the event TLOC?

ESC Guidelines 1893


(2) In case of TLOC, is it of syncopal or non-syncopal origin?

(3) In case of suspected syncope, is there a clear aetiological diagnosis

(see section 4.1.1)?

(4) Is there evidence to suggest a high risk of cardiovascular events or

death (see section 4.1.2)?

TLOC has four specific characteristics: short duration, abnormal motor control, loss of responsiveness, and amnesia for
the period of LOC (for an explanation of the clinical features of

[TLOC see Web Table 4 in section 4.1 of the Web Practical](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

[Instructions).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
TLOC is probably syncope when: (i) there are signs and symptoms
specific for reflex syncope, syncope due to OH, or cardiac syncope,
and (ii) signs and symptoms specific for other forms of TLOC (head
trauma, epileptic seizures, psychogenic TLOC, and/or rare causes)
are absent. Practical instructions for history taking are given in sec
[tions 3 and 4 of the Web Practical Instructions.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)



approximately 60% of cases. [12] For non-syncopal TLOC, refer to sec
tions 7 and 8.

4.1.1 Diagnosis of syncope
The starting point of the diagnostic evaluation of TLOC of suspected
syncopal nature is the initial syncope evaluation, which consists of:

 - [Careful history taking concerning present and previous attacks, as]
well as eyewitness accounts, in person or through a telephone

interview.

 - [Physical] examination, including supine and standing BP

measurements.

 - [Electrocardiogram (ECG).]

Based on these findings, additional examinations may be performed when needed (see section 4.2):

 - [Immediate ECG monitoring when there is a suspicion of arrhyth-]

mic syncope.

 - [Echocardiogram when there is previous known heart disease,]
data suggestive of structural heart disease, or syncope secondary
to cardiovascular cause.

1894 ESC Guidelines



- [Carotid sinus massage (CSM) in patients aged >40 years.]

- [Head-up tilt testing when there is suspicion of syncope due to]
OH or reflex syncope.

- [Blood tests when clinically indicated, e.g. haematocrit or haemo-]
globin when haemorrhage is suspected, oxygen saturation and
blood gas analysis when hypoxia is suspected, troponin when cardiac ischaemia-related syncope is suspected, or D-dimer when


Even if there is no independent gold/reference standard to diagnose syncope, there is strong consensus that the initial evaluation may lead to certain or highly likely diagnosis when the
diagnostic criteria listed in the table of recommendations are

met.









|Recommendations|Classa|Levelb|
|---|---|---|
|Reflex syncope and OH|Reflex syncope and OH|Reflex syncope and OH|
|VVS is highly probable if syncope is precipitated by pain, fear, or standing, and is associated with typical progressive prodrome<br>(pallor, sweating, and/or nausea).8,13–17|I|C|
|Situational reflex syncope is highly probable if syncope occurs during or immediately after specific triggers, listed in<br>Table 3.8,13–17|I|C|
|Syncope due to OH is confirmed when syncope occurs while standing and there is concomitant significant OH.18–24|I|C|
|In the absence of the above criteria, reflex syncope and OH should be considered likely when the features that suggest reflex<br>syncope or OH are present and the features that suggest cardiac syncope are absent (see Table 5).|IIa|C|
|Cardiac syncope|Cardiac syncope|Cardiac syncope|

ESC Guidelines 1895


When a diagnosis is nearly certain or highly likely, no further evaluation is needed, and treatment—if any—can be planned. In other
cases, the initial evaluation may suggest a diagnosis when the features
listed in Table 5 are present, or otherwise is unable to suggest any
diagnosis.











4.1.2 Management of syncope in the emergency
department based on risk stratification
The management of TLOC of suspected syncopal nature in the ED
should answer the following three key questions:

(1) Is there a serious underlying cause that can be identified?

(2) What is the risk of a serious outcome?

(3) Should the patient be admitted to hospital?

Figure 5 shows a flow chart for the management and risk stratification of patients referred to the ED for TLOC suspected to be syncope (modified from Casagranda et al. [40] ).

Question 1: Is there a serious underlying cause that can be
identified in the ED?
Normally the presenting complaint of syncope can be established.
The primary aim for an ED clinician is then to establish an underlying
diagnosis, especially those associated with the potential for rapid clinical deterioration. [41][,][42] It is the acute underlying disease that most frequently determines short-term adverse events rather than the
syncope itself. [43] Subsequent management will focus on treating this
underlying cause (Figure 5). Many (40–45%) non-cardiovascular and
some cardiovascular life-threatening underlying conditions are obvious in the ED. [44] Table 6 lists high-risk features that suggest the presence of a serious underlying cause and low-risk features that suggest
a benign underlying cause.

Question 2: What is the risk of a serious outcome?
High-risk features are shown in Table 6, and how to use this risk profile to guide subsequent management and disposition is shown in
Figure 6.
Risk stratification is important, for two reasons:

(1) To recognize patients with a likely low-risk condition able to be dis
charged with adequate patient education.

(2) To recognize patients with a likely high-risk cardiovascular condition

requiring urgent investigation. This may require admission.

High-risk patients are more likely to have cardiac syncope.
Structural heart disease [25][–][27][,][31][,][35][,][36][,][45] and primary electrical disease [46]

are major risk factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) and overall
mortality in patients with syncope. Low-risk patients are more likely
to have reflex syncope and have an excellent prognosis. [47] OH is
associated with a two-fold higher risk of death owing to the severity
of comorbidities compared with the general population. [48]

Question 3: Should the patient be admitted to hospital?
Approximately 50% of patients who present to the ED with
syncope are admitted (although the rate varies between 12–86%)
[(see Supplementary Data Table 4). The use of clinical decision rules and](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
standardized protocols has not changed this rate significantly. The composite estimate of outcomes is that in the next 7–30 days, only 0.8%

die and 6.9% have a non-fatal severe outcome whilst in the ED, while

[another 3.6% have a post-ED serious outcome (see Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
[Data Table 4). Unnecessary admission in low-risk patients can be harm-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
ful. [87] Whereas it is crucial to identify these high-risk patients to ensure
early, rapid, and intensive investigation, not all patients at high risk need
hospitalization. [80]

The diagnostic tests, procedures, and interventions that may require admission in patients with high-risk features are listed in Table 7.
Furthermore, this Task Force believes that the implementation
of novel care pathways and organizational approaches, such as ED observation units and syncope in- and outpatient units (Figure 6),

offer safe and effective alternatives to admission in the cases
listed in Table 7. Based on a consensus document, [40] a single-centre


<_48 h coupled with fast-tracking to a syncope unit reduced the admission rate to 29%. [77] Among patients not admitted, 20% were discharged after a short observation in the ED, 20% were fast-tracked to
the syncope unit, and 31% were discharged directly from the ED. [77]

Risk stratification scores: There are several ED syncope clinical
decision rules that aim to stratify patients with syncope based on
[medical history, examination, and ECG findings (see Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)

due to poor sensitivity and specificity reported from external validation, or due to a lack of external validation. [70][,][78][–][85] Syncope clinical
decision rules perform no better than clinician judgment at predicting
short-term serious outcomes. [86] Clinical decision rules can predict
poor outcomes, but most syncope deaths and many poor outcomes
are associated with underlying illness rather than syncope per se, [58]

particularly in the long term. [56]

Even if the quality of evidence is moderate, there is strong consensus from several studies that currently available risk stratification scores have not shown better sensitivity, specificity, or
prognostic yield compared with clinical judgment in predicting
short-term serious outcomes after syncope. Therefore, they
should not be used alone to perform risk stratification in

the ED.

4.2 Diagnostic tests
4.2.1 Carotid sinus massage
A ventricular pause lasting >3 s and/or a fall in systolic BP of >50
mmHg is known as carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Carotid sinus
hypersensitivity is a common finding in older men without syncope; abnormal responses are frequently observed (<_40%) in
patients without syncope, especially if they are older and affected
by cardiovascular disease. [89] Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is
exceptional in patients <40 years of age. [90] The specificity of the
test increases if spontaneous syncope is reproduced during CSM.
Syncope was induced in only 5% of asymptomatic persons aged



syndrome (CSS) requires the reproduction of spontaneous symptoms and, in addition, that patients have syncope of unknown origin compatible with a reflex mechanism. In such circumstances,
CSM usually shows a period of asystole >6 s. [91] The prevalence of
CSS, as defined here, was 8.8% when CSM was performed after
the initial evaluation in 1855 consecutive patients >40 years of
age with syncope compatible with a reflex mechanism. [92][,][93] In a
multicentre study [94] aimed at validation of the 2009 ESC

Guidelines, CSM was indicated after initial evaluation in 73% of

700 patients and was diagnostic in 12%. The precise methodology

[and results of CSM are shown in section 5 of the Web Practical](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

[Instructions.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

The main complications of CSM are neurological. When pooling
the data from four studies [90][,][95][–][97] in which 8720 patients were analysed, TIAs or strokes were observed in 21 (0.24%).
The relationship between abnormal response to CSM and
spontaneous syncope is a crucial point that has been studied using
two methods. The first was a pre-post comparison of the recurrence rate of syncope after pacing. Non-randomized studies demonstrated fewer recurrences at follow-up in paced patients than in
those without pacing. These results were confirmed in two
randomized trials. [98][,][99] The second method was to analyse the
occurrence of asystolic episodes registered in patients with a cardioinhibitory response to CSM using an implanted device.
Recordings of long pauses were very common in the two trials
that employed this method. [100][,][101] These results suggest that a
positive response to CSM, reproducing symptoms, in patients
with syncope is highly predictive of the occurrence of spontaneous asystolic episodes.

Even if the quality of evidence is moderate, there is strong consensus from several studies that currently available risk stratification scores have not shown better sensitivity, specificity, or
prognostic yield compared with clinical judgment in predicting
short-term serious outcomes after syncope. Therefore, they
should not be used alone to perform risk stratification in

There is strong consensus that the diagnosis of CSS requires
both the reproduction of spontaneous symptoms during CSM
and clinical features of spontaneous syncope compatible with
a reflex mechanism. The quality of evidence is moderate and is
given by studies of ECG correlation between CSM and sponta



neous events, and indirectly by studies of efficacy of cardiac
pacing. Further research is likely to have an important impact
on our confidence in the estimation of effect and may change

the estimate.

4.2.2 Orthostatic challenge
Changing from the supine to the upright position produces a displacement of blood from the thorax to the lower limbs and abdominal cavity that leads to a decrease in venous return and cardiac
output. In the absence of compensatory mechanisms, a fall in BP may
lead to syncope. [20][,][103][,][104] The diagnostic criteria for OH have been
defined by consensus. [6]

Currently, there are three methods for assessing the response to
change in posture from supine to erect [20][,][103][,][104] : active standing (see
section 4.2.2.1), head-up tilt (see section 4.2.2.2), and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) (see section 4.2.3.4).

4.2.2.1 Active standing

Indications: This test is used to diagnose different types of ortho[static intolerance (see Web Practical Instructions Web Table 1). A](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
sphygmomanometer is adequate for routine clinical testing for classical OH and delayed OH because of its ubiquity and simplicity.
Automatic arm-cuff devices, which are programmed to repeat and
confirm measurements when discrepant values are recorded, are at




a disadvantage due to the rapidly falling BP during OH. With a sphygmomanometer, more than four measurements per minute cannot

be obtained without venous obstruction in the arm. When more fre
quent readings are required, as for initial OH, continuous beat-tobeat non-invasive BP measurement is needed. [20][,][103][,][104]

Diagnostic criteria: Abnormal BP fall is defined as a progressive
and sustained fall in systolic BP from baseline value >_20 mmHg or
diastolic BP >_10 mmHg, or a decrease in systolic BP to <90
mmHg. This definition of OH differs from the 2011 consensus [6] in
adding the 90 mmHg threshold. This Task Force believes that an
absolute threshold of 90 mmHg of systolic BP is useful, especially
in patients with a supine BP <110 mmHg. An isolated diastolic BP
drop is very rare and its clinical relevance for OH diagnosis is limited. Orthostatic heart rate (HR) increase is blunted or absent

[usually not >10 beats per minute (b.p.m.)] in patients with neurogenic OH, but increases or even exaggerates with anaemia or
hypovolaemia. The probability that syncope and orthostatic complaints are due to OH can be assessed using the information given

in Table 8.

4.2.2.2 Tilt testing
Since its introduction in 1986, [105] many protocols have been reported
with variations in the initial stabilization phase, duration, tilt angle,
type of support, and pharmacological provocation. The most commonly used are the trinitroglycerin (TNG) test using 300–400 mg of
sublingual TNG after a 20-min unmedicated phase, [106][,][107] and the
low-dose intravenous isoproterenol test, which uses incremental
doses to increase average HR by about 20–25% over baseline (usually <_3 mg/min). [108][,][109] In a recent systematic literature review, [110] the
overall positivity rate in patients with syncope was 66% for the TNG
protocol and 61% for the isoproterenol protocol; the respective positivity rate in subjects without syncope (controls) ranged from
11–14%; and the test differentiated patients with syncope from controls with an odds ratio of 12. The methodology and classification of
[responses are described in section 6 of the Web Practical Instructions.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
Adding video recording to a tilt table permits objective and repeated
review of clinical signs in relation to BP and HR, and helps to assess
the relative contribution of bradycardia and hypotension to syncope
[(see section 5.2.6.3 and the explanatory video in Web Practical](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071#supplementary-data)
[Instructions section 6.3.15), and to distinguish between VVS and PPS](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071#supplementary-data)
(see section 4.2.5).
The clinical situation corresponding to tilt-induced syncope is that


considered: (i) to confirm a diagnosis of reflex syncope in patients in
whom this diagnosis was suspected but not confirmed by initial evaluation [105][–][109][,][111], and (ii) for the assessment of autonomic
failure, especially for the reproduction of delayed OH (which could not
be detected by active standing because of its delayed onset) [23][,][24][,][112][,][113]

and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). [114] Tilt testing
may be helpful in separating syncope from PPS. [115][–][117]

Tilt testing has limited value in assessing treatment efficacy. [118]

However, tilt testing is widely accepted as a useful tool to demonstrate susceptibility of the patient to reflex syncope, especially a
hypotensive (vasodepressive) tendency, and thereby to initiate treatment (e.g. physical manoeuvres, see section 5). [119][–][121]

The endpoint of tilt testing is the reproduction of
symptoms along with the characteristic circulatory pattern of
the indication mentioned above, namely the induction of reflex hypotension/bradycardia, OH, POTS, or PPS. The typical tilt test result
[patterns are shown in the Web Practical Instructions section 6.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

Interpretation of tilt testing results in patients with reflex syncope:
Some studies [122][,][123] compared the response to tilt testing with spontaneous syncope recorded by an implantable loop recorder (ILR). While
a positive cardioinhibitory response to tilt testing predicts, with a high
probability, an asystolic spontaneous syncope, the presence of a

VVS. This concept has practical implications for therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).

4.2.3 Basic autonomic function tests

Autonomic function assessment helps to identify autonomic failure as
the underlying cause of syncope.

4.2.3.1 Valsalva manoeuvre

The methodology of the Valsalva manoeuvre is described in section

[7.1.1 of the Web Practical Instructions and in Web Video 2. There is](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

strong evidence that the absence of a BP overshoot and an absence
of a HR increase during the Valsalva is pathognomonic for neurogenic
OH, occurring in primary and secondary autonomic failure, and the
degree of hypotension and/or lack of compensation during forced
expiration usually correlate with the degree of autonomic dysfunction and related symptoms. [138][–][143] In contrast, a pronounced BP fall
beyond what is normally expected during forced expiration, but a
normal chronotropic response during the manoeuvre, may occur in
patients with suspected situational syncope, i.e. syncope occurring
during some forms of situational syncope, e.g. coughing, brass instrument playing, singing, and weightlifting. [144]

4.2.3.2 Deep breathing
The methodology of the deep-breathing test is described in section
[7.1.2 of the Web Practical Instructions. Under physiological conditions,](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
HR rises during inspiration and falls during expiration. HR variability
during deep breathing (also called the expiratory/inspiratory index or
E/I index) is >_15 b.p.m. in healthy individuals aged >50 years. [145]

There is strong consensus that blunted or abolished variation is suggestive of parasympathetic dysfunction. [142][,][143][,][146][,][147]

4.2.3.3 Other autonomic function tests
Further tests to evaluate cardiovascular sympathetic function include
calculation of the 30:15 ratio, the cold pressure test, the sustained
hand grip test, and mental arithmetic. There is weak evidence that
these tests may be useful. [13][,][142][,][143][,][147]

4.2.3.4 Twenty-four-hour ambulatory and home blood pressure

monitoring
Twenty-four-hour ABPM and home BP monitoring (HBPM) are
increasingly used to diagnose and monitor the treatment of hypertension. [148] There is strong evidence that OH is frequently associated with
a nocturnal ‘non-dipping’ or even ‘reverse-dipping’ BP pattern in
patients with autonomic failure, with relevant therapeutic and prognostic implications [140][,][148][–][151] [(see Web Practical Instructions section 7.1.3). In](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
these patients, ABPM allows the assessment of nocturnal hypertension,
postprandial hypotension, and exercise- and drug-induced hypotension, as well as monitoring for side effects of antihypotensive regimens
and pointing to additional disorders such as sleep apnoea. [152] There is
weak evidence that ABPM may also detect the degree of OH in daily
life better than single office BP measurements. [153]

HBPM may be used to investigate the cause of orthostatic intolerance, i.e. to clarify whether symptoms are due to OH or to other
causes, such as vertigo or motor imbalance in Parkinson’s disease or
multiple system atrophy. The evidence is weak. Finally, HBPM can be
used to clarify that BP is not low during episodes of PPS. [154]


positive vasodepressor, mixed response, or even a negative response,
does not exclude the presence of asystole during spontaneous
syncope. [122][,][123]

Tilt testing has an acceptable sensitivity [124] and specificity [106][,][124][,][125] when these are calculated in patients with true VVS
or without a history of syncope. However, there is an inability to
apply the test to populations with syncope of uncertain cause
where it is hoped that tilt testing might prove decisive. In these
clinical settings, tilt testing fails to deliver (Figure 7). Indeed, tilt
testing was positive in 51–56% of patients with atypical clinical features suggesting a reflex mechanism, [106][,][124][–][128] in 30–36% with
unexplained syncope after full investigation, [124][,][129] and in 45–47%
with true cardiac arrhythmic syncope. [130][,][131] In other words, tilt
testing offers little diagnostic value in patients for whom it is most
needed. In these patients, a positive tilt test reveals a susceptibility
to orthostatic stress. [132] This hypotensive susceptibility plays a role in
causing syncope irrespective of the aetiology and mechanism of
syncope. For example, in arrhythmic syncope caused by paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias, the mechanism is a combination of
onset of the arrhythmia itself and hypotensive susceptibility,
corroborated by positive tilt testing. [130][,][131] Similarly, multifactorial
mechanisms are likely in other types of cardiac syncope, e.g. aortic
stenosis, [133] hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), [134] and
sick sinus syndrome. [135][,][136] The presence or absence of susceptibility explains the occurrence of syncope in some and not in
others affected by the same severity of arrhythmia or structural
defect. Tilt testing should now be considered a means of
exposing a hypotensive tendency rather than being diagnostic of

4.2.4 Electrocardiographic monitoring (non-invasive and
invasive)
The role of ECG monitoring cannot be defined in isolation. As a rule,
ECG monitoring is indicated only when there is a high pre-test probability of identifying an arrhythmia associated with syncope, such as

those listed in Table 5.

4.2.4.1 In-hospital monitoring
In-hospital monitoring (in bed or by telemetry) is warranted in
patients with high-risk clinical features (defined in Table 6) suggesting
arrhythmic syncope, especially if the monitoring is applied immediately after syncope. Although the diagnostic yield of ECG monitoring
varies from 1.9–17.6%, [158][–][160] it is justified by the need to avoid


4.2.4.2 Holter monitoring
Since, in most patients, symptoms do not recur during monitoring, the
true yield of Holter monitoring in syncope may be as low as 1–2% in
an unselected population. In 15% of patients, symptoms were not associated with arrhythmia. [161] Thus, in these patients, a rhythm disturbance
could potentially be excluded as a cause of syncope. Holter monitoring
in syncope is inexpensive in terms of set-up costs, but expensive in
terms of cost per diagnosis. [162] Holter monitoring in syncope may be of
more value if symptoms are frequent. Daily single or multiple episodes
of LOC might increase the potential for symptom–ECG correlation.

4.2.4.3 Prospective external event recorders
Event recorders are external devices that are applied by the patient
when symptoms occur. Whereas these recorders can be useful in

1906 ESC Guidelines


the investigation of palpitations, [163] they have a marginal role in the
evaluation of syncope.

4.2.4.4 Smartphone applications
Because up to now smartphone applications have recorded real-time
ECG, their current role in syncope is limited for the same reason as
for prospective event recorders. [164][,][165] However, home video
records are very useful in all forms of TLOC (see section 4.2.5.2).

4.2.4.5 External loop recorders
In general, external loop recorders have a higher diagnostic yield than
Holter monitoring. [162] External loop recorders can be useful in
patients with relatively frequent syncope episodes. [166][–][168] In a recent
multicentre international registry, the diagnostic yield in syncope was
24.5%, with the most common finding being bradyarrhythmias; the
stronger predictor for diagnostic findings was early monitoring after
the index event. [166]

4.2.4.6 Remote (at home) telemetry
Most recently, external and implantable device systems have been
developed that provide continuous ECG recording or 24-h loop
memory with wireless transmission (real time) to a service centre.
Some recent studies have shown that implementing remote monitoring increases the diagnostic yield and achieves diagnosis earlier than
without remote monitoring. [169][–][171]

4.2.4.7 Implantable loop recorders
In a meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials (RCTs), [172][–][176]

660 patients with unexplained syncope were randomized to a conventional strategy consisting of an external loop recorder, tilt testing,
and an electrophysiological study (EPS), or to prolonged monitoring
with an ILR. The results showed that initial implantation of an ILR in
the workup provided a 3.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7–5.0]
increased relative probability of a diagnosis compared with the con[ventional strategy (see Supplementary Data Table 5). ILR was more](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
cost-effective than a conventional strategy. [172][,][173][,][177][,][178]

In pooled data from nine studies [179] performed in 506
patients with unexplained syncope at the end of complete negative work-up, a correlation between syncope and ECG was
found in 176 patients (35%); of these, 56% had asystole (or
bradycardia in a few cases) at the time of the recorded event,
11% had tachycardia, and 33% had no arrhythmia. Presyncope
was much less likely to be associated with an arrhythmia than
syncope. Similar findings were subsequently observed with ILR
use expanded in an early phase of evaluation in patients with
recurrent syncope of uncertain origin, in the absence of highrisk criteria and structural heart disease, [176][,][180][–][183] and in suspected reflex syncope. [184][–][186] In particular, an asystolic pause

was much less likely to be associated with an arrhythmia than
syncope. Similar findings were subsequently observed with ILR
use expanded in an early phase of evaluation in patients with
recurrent syncope of uncertain origin, in the absence of highrisk criteria and structural heart disease, [176][,][180][–][183] and in suspected reflex syncope. [184][–][186] In particular, an asystolic pause
was present during syncope in about 50% of these patients.


There are several areas of interest other than unexplained syncope in which ILRs have been investigated:

 - [Patients with bundle branch block (BBB) in whom paroxysmal]
atrioventricular (AV) block is likely despite negative complete
EPS: an arrhythmia was observed in 41% of these patients (being
paroxysmal AV block in 70%) under ILR observation, based on
pooled data from three studies [174][,][187][,][188] [(see Supplementary Data](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
[Table 6).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)

 - [Patients in whom epilepsy was suspected but the treatment has]
proven ineffective: in pooled data, an attack could have
been documented by ILR in 62% of patients, with an arrhythmic
cause being responsible in 26% [137][,][189][–][191] [(see Supplementary Data](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
[Table 7).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)

 - [Patients with unexplained falls: in pooled data, an attack could]
have been documented by ILR in 70% of patients, with an
arrhythmic cause being responsible in 14% [191][–][194] (see
[Supplementary Data Table 8).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)

 - [Patients with HCM, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomy-]
opathy (ARVC), or primary electrical diseases (see section 5.4).

4.2.4.8 Diagnostic criteria
The gold standard for the diagnosis of arrhythmic syncope is when
there is a correlation between the symptoms and an ECG recording. [195][,][196] The presence of asymptomatic significant arrhythmias—
defined as prolonged asystole (>_3 s), rapid supraventricular
tachycardias (SVTs) (i.e. >160 b.p.m. for >32 beats), or ventricular
tachycardias (VTs)—has been considered by several authors to be a
diagnostic finding. [185][,][188][,][197][–][199] On the other hand, although the
absence of documentation of an arrhythmia during a syncopal episode cannot be considered to be a specific diagnosis, it allows the
exclusion of an arrhythmia as the mechanism of the syncope. Most
evidence in support of the above diagnostic criteria is indirectly based
on the benefit of specific therapies guided by ECG monitoring in preventing syncopal recurrences. [172][,][184][–][186][,][188][,][200]

Even if the quality of evidence is moderate, there is strong consensus based on evidence from several controlled trials that a
correlation between symptoms and a documented arrhythmia,
or the presence of some asymptomatic significant arrhythmias
(defined above), is diagnostic of the cause of syncope and specific treatment must be prescribed.

The principal limitation of any ECG monitoring device is the
inability to record BP together with ECG. In reflex syncope, the
documentation of bradycardia/asystole during a syncopal episode
does not rule out the possibility that a hidden hypotensive reflex
is the principal cause for syncope, and that bradycardia/asystole is
a secondary late event. This issue has important implications for
therapy (see section 5). A classification of ECG recordings with
[their probable related pathophysiology is available in Web Table 6](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

allows detailed study of the face and head, which is useful when
assessing the start and end of LOC. [9][,][205] Video recording of tiltinduced PPS [116] ensures that apparent TLOC occurs while BP and HR

are not low; adding an EEG increases the diagnostic probability of
PPS even further. The method has been proven to show the combined presence of VVS and PPS. [117]

4.2.5.2 Home video recording
Home video records (by means of smartphone technology) are very
useful in all forms of TLOC to allow signs of an attack to be studied.
Patients and their relatives should be urged to record attacks, if possible, in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. In epilepsy, advances are made
towards prolonged video and EEG recording in patients’
homes. [206][,][207] For syncope or PPS, experience suggests that the chances of obtaining a video record are higher for PPS than for syncope,
which is probably the effect of a high frequency and long duration of
attacks in PPS. It is rare for the beginning of events to be recorded. [206]

Home video records allow complex events such as syncope-induced
epileptic seizures to be diagnosed. [208]

4.2.6 Electrophysiological study

Indications: In an overview of eight studies, including 625 patients
with syncope undergoing EPS, [209] positive results occurred predominantly in patients with structural heart disease. In recent years, the
development of powerful non-invasive methods, i.e. prolonged ECG
monitoring, showing a higher diagnostic value, has decreased the
importance of EPS as a diagnostic test. In clinical practice, registry data
show that approximately 3% of patients with unexplained syncope
evaluated by cardiologists undergo EPS and even fewer if they are
evaluated by other specialists. [71] Nevertheless, EPS remains useful for
diagnosis in the following specific clinical situations: asymptomatic
sinus bradycardia (suspected sinus arrest causing syncope), bifascicular BBB (impending high-degree AV block), and suspected
tachycardia.

Diagnostic criteria: 4.2.6.1 Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia: suspected sinus arrest causing syncope
The pre-test probability of bradycardia-related syncope is relatively



sinoatrial block, usually documented by 12-lead ECG or ECG monitoring. The prognostic value of a prolonged sinus node recovery time
(SNRT) is not well defined. An abnormal response is defined as >_1.6
or 2 s for SNRT, or >_525 ms for corrected SNRT. [210] One observatio
nal study showed a relationship between the presence of prolonged
SNRT at EPS and the effect of pacing on symptoms. [211] Another small
prospective study showed that a corrected SNRT >_800 ms had an
eight-fold higher risk of syncope than a SNRT below this value. [212]

4.2.6.2 Syncope in bifascicular bundle branch block (impending highdegree atrioventricular block)
Patients with bifascicular block and syncope are at higher risk of developing high-degree AV block. [213] A prolonged HV interval >_70 ms, or
induction of second- or third-degree AV block by pacing or by pharmacological stress (ajmaline, procainamide, or disopyramide), identifies a group at higher risk of developing AV block. By combining the
above-mentioned parts of the electrophysiological protocol, a positive
EPS yielded a positive predictive value as high as >_80% for the identification of patients who will develop AV block in old studies. [214][–][216]

This finding has been indirectly confirmed by recent studies that
showed a significant reduction in syncopal recurrences in patients
with prolonged HV implanted with a pacemaker compared with a
control group of untreated patients with a negative EPS [188], or with a
control group who received an empiric pacemaker. [217] These results
justify an upgrade of the recommendation for EPS-guided therapy (i.e.
cardiac pacing) in patients with a positive EPS from class IIa to class I.

Even if the quality of evidence is moderate, there is strong consensus that a positive EPS indicates that the likely mechanism
of syncope is paroxysmal AV block.
Conversely, approximately one-third of patients with a negative EPS in
whom an ILR was implanted developed intermittent or permanent AV
block on follow-up. [187] Thus, EPS has a low negative predictive value.
Mortality is high in patients with syncope and BBB. However, neither
syncope nor prolonged H-V interval were associated with a higher risk
of death, and pacemaker therapy did not decrease this risk. [213]

4.2.6.3 Suspected tachycardia
In patients with syncope preceded by a sudden onset of brief palpitations suggesting SVT or VT, an EPS may be indicated to assess the
exact mechanism, especially when a curative catheter ablation proce
dure is considered to be beneficial.

In patients with a previous myocardial infarction and preserved left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), induction of sustained monomorphic VT is strongly predictive of the cause of syncope, [218]

whereas the induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) is considered a
non-specific finding. [37] The absence of induction of ventricular
arrhythmias identifies a group at lower risk of arrhythmic syncope. [219]

The role of EPS and the use of pharmacological challenge by
class I antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with syncope and suspected Brugada syndrome is controversial. In a recent meta-analysis, [220] the risk of arrhythmic events was slightly increased in
patients with a history of unexplained syncope or a spontaneous
type 1 pattern, and who had induction of VT or VF with one or

two extra stimuli. However, the absence of induction in such indi
viduals does not necessarily preclude arrhythmia risk, particularly
in patients with high-risk features.


4.2.5.2 Home video recording
Home video records (by means of smartphone technology) are very
useful in all forms of TLOC to allow signs of an attack to be studied.
Patients and their relatives should be urged to record attacks, if possible, in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. In epilepsy, advances are made

4.2.7 Endogenous adenosine and other biomarkers
Established cardiac biomarkers such as troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide have been used to distinguish cardiac from non-cardiac
syncope and identify structural heart disease. [223][–][225]

4.2.7.1 Adenosine (triphosphate) test and plasma concentration
The purinergic signalling system, including adenosine and its
receptors, has been proposed to be involved in unexplained
syncope without prodrome. [4][,][226] A low plasma adenosine level is
associated with paroxysmal AV block or CSS, whereas a high


and VVS. In parallel, the adenosine/adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) provocation test has been performed to demonstrate the
utility of adenosine sensitivity and paroxysmal cardioinhibitory
propensity for the selection of appropriate pacemaker candidates. [4][,][227][,][228] The test requires rapid (<2 s) injection of a 20 mg
bolus of ATP/adenosine during ECG monitoring. The induction of
AV block with ventricular asystole lasting >6 s, or the induction
of AV block lasting >10 s, is considered abnormal. ATP testing
was positive in most patients with syncope of unknown origin
(especially syncope without prodrome and without structural
heart disease [4] ) but not in controls, suggesting that paroxysmal AV

1910 ESC Guidelines


block could be the cause of unexplained syncope. Although cardiac pacing may lead to substantial reduction of syncopal attacks
in elderly patients with unexplained syncope and a positive ATP
test, [229] previous studies showed no correlation between
AV block induced by ATP and ECG findings (documented by ILR)
during spontaneous syncope. [122][,][123][,][227] Thus, the low predictive
value of the test does not support its routine use in selecting
patients for cardiac pacing, but rather its positivity suggests that
it can be used to confirm the suspicion of asystolic syncope
by means of prolonged ECG monitoring. The role of endogenous
adenosine release in triggering a special form of asystolic
syncope (so-called adenosine-sensitive syncope) remains under

investigation.

4.2.7.2 Cardiovascular biomarkers

Some cardiovascular biomarkers are increased in autonomic dysfunction underlying syncope, such as elevated copeptin (vasopressin),
endothelin-1, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide in
OH, [113][,][230][,][231] whereas atrial natriuretic peptide may be reduced in
POTS. [113] At present, the use of cardiovascular biomarkers in the
diagnosis of syncope awaits more evidence and verification in independent cohorts.



4.2.7.3 Immunological biomarkers
Autoantibodies against adrenergic receptors in OH and POTS have
been reported, but further studies are needed. [232][–][234]

4.2.8 Echocardiography
For patients with suspected heart disease, echocardiography serves
to confirm or refute the suspicions in equal proportions and plays an
important role in risk stratification. [235][,][236] Echocardiography identifies
the cause of syncope in very few patients when no more tests are
needed (i.e. severe aortic stenosis, obstructive cardiac tumours or
thrombi, pericardial tamponade, or aortic dissection). [237][–][239] In a literature review, right and left atrial myxoma presented with syncope
in <20% of cases. [240][–][244]

4.2.8.1 Exercise stress echocardiography
Upright or semi-supine exercise stress echocardiography to detect
provocable left ventricular outflow tract obstruction should be considered in patients with HCM that complain of exertional or postural
syncope, particularly when it recurs during similar circumstances (e.g.
when rushing upstairs or straining). A gradient of >_50 mmHg is usually considered to be the threshold at which left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction becomes haemodynamically important. [245][–][249]

ESC Guidelines 1911


4.2.9 Exercise stress testing
Exercise-induced syncope is infrequent, and the literature is limited to case reports. Exercise testing should be performed in
patients who have experienced episodes of syncope during or
shortly after exertion. Syncope can occur during or immediately
after exercise. These two situations should be considered separately. Indeed, syncope occurring during exercise is likely due to
cardiac causes (even though some case reports have shown that it
might be a manifestation of an exaggerated reflex vasodilatation),
whereas syncope occurring after exercise is almost invariably due
to a reflex mechanism. [250][–][252] Tachycardia-related exerciseinduced second- and third-degree AV block has been shown to be
located distal to the AV node [253] and predicts progression to permanent AV block. [254][,][255] A resting ECG frequently shows intraventricular conduction abnormalities, [253][,][254] but cases with a normal
resting ECG have also been described. [256][,][257] There are no data
supporting an indication for exercise testing in a general population with syncope.

### 5. Treatment

5.1 General principles of treatment of

syncope
The general framework of treatment is based on risk stratification
and the identification of specific mechanisms when possible (Figure 8).
The following three general principles should be considered:

 - [The efficacy of therapy aimed at preventing syncope recurrence]
is largely determined by the mechanism of syncope rather than
its aetiology. Bradycardia is a frequent mechanism of syncope.
Cardiac pacing is the most powerful therapy for bradycardia but
its efficacy is less if hypotension coexists (see Table 9 and
[Supplementary Data Table 9). The treatment of syncope due to a](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
hypotensive reflex or to OH is more challenging because specific
therapies are less effective.

 - [Often, therapy to prevent recurrence differs from that for the]
underlying disease. The management of patients at high risk of
SCD requires careful assessment of the individual patient’s risk
(see section 5.5).

 - [Syncopal recurrences often decrease spontaneously after medical]
assessment, even in the absence of a specific therapy; in general,
syncope recurs in <50% of patients within 1–2 years (see
[Supplementary Data Table 10). The decrease seems to be more](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
evident when there is a lack of a clear anatomical substrate for

syncope, such as in the case of reflex syncope and unexplained
syncope. The reason for this decrease is not known. Several
potential clinical, statistical, and psychological explanations have
[been provided and all probably play a role (see Supplementary](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
[Data Table 10). Whatever the reason, the possibility of spontane-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
ous improvement has major practical importance for treatment
that can be postponed in low-risk conditions. The consequence
of the spontaneous decrease is that any therapy for syncope prevention appears to be more effective than it actually is, which
makes the results of observational data on therapy questionable
in the absence of a control group.

5.2 Treatment of reflex syncope
Despite its benign course, recurrent and unpredictable reflex syncope may be disabling. The cornerstone of management of these

4.2.10 Coronary angiography
In patients presenting with syncope and obstructive coronary artery
disease, percutaneous coronary intervention is not associated with a
significant reduction in readmission for syncope. [258] Angiography
alone is not diagnostic of the cause of syncope. Therefore, cardiac
catheterization techniques should be carried out in suspected myo
cardial ischaemia or infarction with the same indications as for

patients without syncope.

lifestyle modification, and reassurance regarding the benign nature of

the condition.

Additional treatment may be necessary in patients with severe forms,
[as defined in Web Practical Instructions section 2.3, in particular: when](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
very frequent syncope alters quality of life; when recurrent syncope
without, or with a very short, prodrome exposes the patient to a risk of
trauma; and when syncope occurs during a high-risk activity (e.g. driving,
machine operation, flying, or competitive athletics, etc.). Only 14% of
the highly selected population with reflex syncope who are referred to
specialized syncope units may need such additional treatment. [186] In general, no therapy is appropriate for every form of reflex syncope. The
most important discriminant for the choice of therapy is age. A decision
pathway for the selection of a specific therapy according to age, severity


5.2.1 Education and lifestyle modifications
Education and lifestyle modifications have not been evaluated in
randomized studies, but there is a consensus for implementing them
as first-line therapy in all cases. These comprise reassurance about
the benign nature of the disease, education regarding awareness and the
possible avoidance of triggers and situations (e.g. dehydration and/or
hot crowded environments), and the early recognition of prodromal
symptoms in order to sit or lie down and activate counter-pressure
manoeuvres without delay. If possible, triggers should be addressed
directly, such as cough suppression in cough syncope, micturition in the
sitting position, etc. Increased intake of oral fluids is also advised. Salt
supplementation at a dose of 120 mmol/day of sodium chloride has
been proposed. [259] In general, >50% of patients with recurrent syncopal
episodes in the 1 or 2 years before evaluation do not have syncopal
recurrences in the following 1 or 2 years and, in those with recurrences,

ESC Guidelines 1913


the burden of syncope decreases by >70% compared with the
preceding period. The effect of education and reassurance is
probably the most likely reason for the decrease in syncope
[(see Supplementary Data Table 10). An example of a patient instruction](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
[sheet can be found in the Web Practical Instructions section 9.1: European](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
Society of Cardiology information sheet for patients affected by reflex


Despite the lack of controlled studies, there is strong consensus
that education and lifestyle modifications have a high impact
in reducing recurrence of syncope.

5.2.2 Discontinuation/reduction of hypotensive therapy
Careful avoidance of agents that lower BP, i.e. any antihypertensive agents, nitrates, diuretics, neuroleptic antidepressants, or

1914 ESC Guidelines


dopaminergic drugs, is key in the prevention of recurrence of syncope. In a small randomized trial [260] performed in 58 patients
(mean age 74 ± 11 years) affected by vasodepressor reflex syncope diagnosed by tilt testing or CSM, who were taking on average
2.5 hypotensive drugs, discontinuation or reduction of the vasoactive therapy caused a reduction of the rate of the primary combined endpoint of syncope, presyncope, and adverse events from
50 to 19% (hazard ratio 0.37) compared with a control group who
continued hypotensive therapy during a follow-up of 9 months. In
the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, [261] patients at high
cardiovascular risk who were already using antihypertensive drugs
targeting a systolic BP of 120 mmHg had an approximately twofold risk of syncope vs. the control group targeting a systolic BP of
140 mmHg. In a short-term randomized trial [262] conducted in 32
patients affected by CSS, withdrawal of vasodilator therapy
reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor reflex induced by

CSM.

There is moderate evidence that discontinuation/reduction of
hypotensive therapy targeting a systolic BP of 140 mmHg
should be effective in reducing syncopal recurrences in patients
with hypotensive susceptibility. Further research is likely to
have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate.

5.2.3 Physical counter-pressure manoeuvres
Isometric muscle contractions increase cardiac output and arterial BP
during the phase of impending reflex syncope. Three clinical studies [119][,][120][,][263] and one prospective multicentre randomized trial [121]

assessed the effectiveness of physical counter-pressure manoeuvres
(PCM) of the legs or arms and showed that they allowed the patient
to avoid or delay losing consciousness in most cases. In the Physical
Counterpressure Manoeuvres Trial (PC-Trial), [121] 223 patients aged
38 ± 15 years with recurrent reflex syncope and recognizable prodromal symptoms were randomized to receive standardized conventional therapy alone or conventional therapy plus training in PCM.
Actuarial recurrence-free survival was better in the PCM group
(log-rank P=0.018), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 39% (95%
CI 11–53). No adverse events were reported. A limitation of this
treatment is that it cannot be used in patients with short or absent
prodrome and that PCM are less effective in patients older than 60
years. [264] An instruction sheet on how to perform PCM can be found

[in the Web Practical Instructions section 9.2.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

There is moderate evidence that PCM is effective in reducing
syncopal recurrences in patients <60 years old with longlasting recognizable prodromal symptoms.

5.2.4 Tilt training
In highly motivated young patients with recurrent vasovagal symptoms triggered by orthostatic stress, the prescription of progressively
prolonged periods of enforced upright posture (so-called tilt training)
has been proposed to reduce syncope recurrence. [265] While some
studies suggested modest benefit with outpatient tilt training, [266][,][267]

most controlled trials reported no significant effect. [268][–][272]

Moreover, this treatment is hampered by the low compliance of



There is sufficient evidence from multiple trials that tilt training has little efficacy in reducing recurrence of syncope in
young patients with long-lasting recognizable prodromal symptoms. Further research is unlikely to have an important impact
on our confidence in the estimate.

5.2.5 Pharmacological therapy
Pharmacological therapy may be considered in patients who have
recurrent syncope despite education and lifestyle modifications
including training in PCM. Many drugs have been tested in the treatment of reflex syncope, for the most part with disappointing results.
While results have been satisfactory in uncontrolled trials or shortterm controlled trials, several long-term placebo-controlled prospective trials have not shown a benefit of the active drug over placebo,
with some exceptions.

5.2.5.1 Fludrocortisone

Fludrocortisone, by increasing renal sodium reabsorption and
expanding plasma volume, may counteract the physiological cascade
leading to the orthostatic vasovagal reflex. [273] The mechanism of
action can be compared with that of saline infusion, which has also
proved effective in acute tilt test studies. [274] The Prevention of
Syncope Trial (POST) 2 [275] enrolled 210 young (median age 30 years)
patients with low–normal values of arterial BP and without comorbidities, and randomized them to receive fludrocortisone (titrated at
a dosage of 0.05–0.2 mg once per day) or placebo. The primary endpoint showed only a marginal non-significant reduction in syncope in
the fludrocortisone group compared with the placebo group (hazard
ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.46–1.03; P=0.069), which became more significant when the analysis was restricted to patients who achieved 0.2
mg/day dose stabilization at 2 weeks. The clinical benefit of fludrocortisone therapy was modest: at 12 months, 44% of patients in the fludrocortisone arm continued to suffer syncope, a rate only slightly
lower than the 60.5% rate observed in the placebo arm. In the meantime, a similar number of patients discontinued fludrocortisone therapy owing to side effects, thus equating the benefit/risk ratio.
Fludrocortisone should not be used in patients with hypertension or

heart failure. Fludrocortisone was ineffective in a small randomized
double-blind trial in children. [276]

There is moderate evidence that fludrocortisone may be effective in reducing syncopal recurrences in young patients with
lownormal values of arterial BP and without comorbidities.
Further research is likely to have an important impact on our
confidence in the estimate of effect.

5.2.5.2 Alpha-agonists
As failure to achieve proper vasoconstriction of the peripheral vessels is common in reflex syncope, alpha-agonist vasoconstrictors (etilefrine and midodrine) have been used. Etilefrine has been studied in
a large randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial. [277] During
follow-up, patients treated twice daily with etilefrine 25 mg or placebo showed no difference in the frequency of syncope or the time
to recurrence. Midodrine [usually 2.5–10 mg, three times daily (t.i.d)]
has proved effective in small studies but none satisfied the criteria of
a pivotal clinical trial. A recent systematic review of these trials [278]


There is moderate evidence that discontinuation/reduction of
hypotensive therapy targeting a systolic BP of 140 mmHg
should be effective in reducing syncopal recurrences in patients
with hypotensive susceptibility. Further research is likely to
have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate.


5.2.3 Physical counter-pressure manoeuvres
Isometric muscle contractions increase cardiac output and arterial BP
during the phase of impending reflex syncope. Three clinical studies [119][,][120][,][263] and one prospective multicentre randomized trial [121]

assessed the effectiveness of physical counter-pressure manoeuvres
(PCM) of the legs or arms and showed that they allowed the patient
to avoid or delay losing consciousness in most cases. In the Physical
Counterpressure Manoeuvres Trial (PC-Trial), [121] 223 patients aged
38 ± 15 years with recurrent reflex syncope and recognizable prodromal symptoms were randomized to receive standardized conventional therapy alone or conventional therapy plus training in PCM.
Actuarial recurrence-free survival was better in the PCM group
(log-rank P=0.018), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 39% (95%
CI 11–53). No adverse events were reported. A limitation of this
treatment is that it cannot be used in patients with short or absent
prodrome and that PCM are less effective in patients older than 60
years. [264] An instruction sheet on how to perform PCM can be found

[in the Web Practical Instructions section 9.2.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)


There is moderate evidence that PCM is effective in reducing
syncopal recurrences in patients <60 years old with longlasting recognizable prodromal symptoms.


5.2.4 Tilt training
In highly motivated young patients with recurrent vasovagal symptoms triggered by orthostatic stress, the prescription of progressively
prolonged periods of enforced upright posture (so-called tilt training)
has been proposed to reduce syncope recurrence. [265] While some
studies suggested modest benefit with outpatient tilt training, [266][,][267]

most controlled trials reported no significant effect. [268][–][272]

Moreover, this treatment is hampered by the low compliance of
patients in continuing the training programme for a long period.

ESC Guidelines 1915


showed that the confidence in estimates was moderate because of

imprecision and publication bias. The most frequent side effects that
led to discontinuation of midodrine were supine hypertension, pilomotor reactions, and urinary problems (urinary retention, hesitancy,
or urgency). The major limitation of midodrine is frequent dosing,
which limits long-term compliance. Overall, these data suggest that
chronic pharmacological treatment with alpha-agonists alone may be
of little use in reflex syncope and that long-term treatment cannot be
advised for occasional symptoms.

There are contrasting results from multiple trials that alphaagonists may be effective in reducing syncopal recurrences in
patients with the orthostatic form of VVS. Further research is
likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the

estimate.

5.2.5.3 Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers have been presumed to lessen the degree of ventricular mechanoreceptor activation owing to their negative inotropic
effect in reflex syncope. This theory has not been supported by the

outcome of clinical trials. Beta-blockers failed to be effective in VVS
in two randomized double-blind controlled trials. [279][,][280] A rationale

for the use of beta-blockers in other forms of neutrally-mediated syncope is lacking. It should be emphasized that beta-blockers may
enhance bradycardia in CSS.

There is sufficient evidence from multiple trials that betablockers are not appropriate in reducing syncopal recurrences.
Desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced.

5.2.5.4 Other drugs
Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was effective in
one placebo-controlled trial, which included highly symptomatic
patients from one institution. [281] This finding has not been confirmed
in other studies and has no experimental support. Conversely,
human studies with different subtypes of serotonin-receptor antagonists demonstrated a decreased tolerance to tilt. [1][,][282] In a small
randomized trial, benzodiazepine was as effective as metoprolol. [283]

A somatostatin analogue (octreotide) [284] was used in a few patients
affected by orthostatic intolerance and its effect cannot be properly

evaluated.

5.2.5.5 Emerging new therapies in specific subgroups
Low-adenosine phenotype. In a series of case reports, theophylline
appeared effective in patients with recurrent sudden onset (pre)syncope who presented with the common biological characteristic of
low circulating adenosine levels. [285][,][286] Theophylline is a non-selective
adenosine receptor antagonist that is potentially effective when
adenosine is suspected to be involved in the mechanism of syncope.
An intra-patient comparison between a period with and a period
without theophylline therapy, with the support of prolonged ECG
monitoring, showed that symptoms disappeared and the number of
prolonged asystolic pauses was impressively reduced from a median
of 1.11 per month during 13 months of no treatment to 0 per month
during 20 months of theophylline treatment.
Low-norepinephrine phenotype. A mismatch between sympathetic



orthostatic VVS. [287] Norepinephrine transport inhibitors (reboxetine
and sibutramine) lead to a selective increase in sympathetic tone during stress by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine in sympathetic
neuronal synapses. In double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion,
reboxetine and sibutramine block or attenuate the vasovagal reflex
during tilt testing. [288] In an open-label prospective clinical study in
seven very symptomatic patients who had not responded to any previous treatment, sibutramine achieved 94% suppression of syncopal
episodes at 6 months. [289]

Ganglionic plexus ablation. Radiofrequency ablation of vagal ganglia
located close to the sinus node and AV node was reported to abolish
the vagal efferent output during VVS in some observational studies
and case reports. [290][,][291] However, owing to a weak rationale, small
populations, weak documentation of follow-up results, procedural
risks, and lack of control groups, the current evidence is insufficient
to confirm the efficacy of vagal ganglia ablation.

5.2.6 Cardiac pacing
Permanent pacemaker therapy may be effective if asystole is a dominant feature of reflex syncope. Establishing a relationship between
symptoms and bradycardia should be the goal of the clinical evaluation of patients with syncope and a normal baseline ECG. The efficacy
of pacing depends on the clinical setting. A comparative table of
[results in different settings is reported in the Supplementary Data](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
[Table 9. Figure 10 summarizes the recommended indication for](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)

pacing.

5.2.6.1 Evidence from trials in suspected or certain reflex syncope and
electrocardiogram-documented asystole
In two observational studies, cardiac pacing reduced syncope burden
in patients with documented asystolic syncope by 92 [184] and 83%, [200]

but did not prevent all syncopal events. In the randomized
double-blind Third International Study on Syncope of Uncertain
Etiology (ISSUE)-3 trial, [185] 77 patients who had documentation, by
means of ILR, of syncope with >_3-s asystole or >_6-s asystole without
syncope were randomly assigned to receive either dual-chamber pacing with rate drop response or sensing only. During follow-up, the 2year estimated rate of syncope recurrence was 57% with pacemaker
off and 25% with pacemaker on (log-rank P¼0.039). The risk of
recurrence was reduced by 57%. In the ILR subgroup of the multicentre Syncope Unit Project (SUP) 2 study, [292] the estimated rates of
syncope recurrence with pacing were 11% at 1 year, 24% at 2 years,
and 24% at 3 years, and were significantly lower than the corresponding rates observed in untreated control patients. The above evidence
supports a class IIa recommendation

There is sufficient evidence that dual-chamber cardiac pacing
should be considered to reduce recurrence of syncope when
the correlation between symptoms and ECG is established in
patients �40 years of age with the clinical features of those in

the ISSUE studies.

5.2.6.2 Evidence from trials in patients with carotid sinus syndrome
The evidence supporting the benefit of cardiac pacing in patients
affected by cardioinhibitory CSS is limited to a few small controlled
trials and retrospective observational studies. In a review [293] including


There are contrasting results from multiple trials that alphaagonists may be effective in reducing syncopal recurrences in
patients with the orthostatic form of VVS. Further research is
likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the

estimate.


5.2.5.3 Beta-blockers

Beta-blockers have been presumed to lessen the degree of ventricular mechanoreceptor activation owing to their negative inotropic
effect in reflex syncope. This theory has not been supported by the

outcome of clinical trials. Beta-blockers failed to be effective in VVS
in two randomized double-blind controlled trials. [279][,][280] A rationale

for the use of beta-blockers in other forms of neutrally-mediated syncope is lacking. It should be emphasized that beta-blockers may

1916 ESC Guidelines



12 studies for a total of 601 paced and 305 unpaced patients, the syncopal recurrence rate during follow-up ranged from 0–20% with pacing, whereas the recurrence of syncope was always higher in
untreated patients, who showed a rate between 20–60%. In a metaanalysis of the three studies [293] with a control group of untreated
patients, syncope recurred in 9% of 85 paced patients and in 38% of
91 controls (relative risk 0.24, 95% CI 0.12–0.48). In a single-centre
registry of 169 consecutive patients treated with pacemakers, the
actuarial estimate of syncopal recurrence was 7% at 1 year, 16% at
3 years, and 20% at 5 years. [90] In the CSS subgroup of the multicentre
SUP 2 study, [292] the estimated syncope recurrence rates with pacing
were 9% at 1 year, 18% at 2 years, and 20% at 3 years, and were significantly lower than the corresponding rates observed in untreated
controls, which were 21%, 33%, and 43%, respectively. Given the
similar outcome of patients with reflex spontaneous asystolic pauses
and those with CSS, this Task Force voted to downgrade the recommendation for pacing in patients with CSS from class I (as in the 2013
ESC Pacing Guidelines [294] ) to class IIa.

Despite the lack of large RCTs, there is sufficient evidence that
dual-chamber cardiac pacing should be considered to reduce
syncopal recurrences in patients affected by dominant cardioinhibitory CSS.

Two variables are well known to hamper the efficacy of pacing therapy in CSS: the mixed forms [93][,][98] [(see also Web Practical Instructions](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
section 5) and the association with positivity of tilt testing. Patients
who have positive tilt tests have a three-fold greater probability of
syncope recurrence after dual chamber pacing than those with negative tilt tests [293][,][295] ; thus, when tilt testing is positive, caution must be


5.2.6.3 Evidence from trials in patients with tilt-induced vasovagal

syncope
Effectiveness of pacing in patients with tilt-induced VVS has been
studied in five multicentre RCTs. [296][–][300] When combining the results
of these trials, 318 patients were evaluated; syncope recurred in 21%
of the paced patients and in 44% of unpaced patients (P < 0.001). A
meta-analysis of all studies suggested a non-significant 17% reduction
in syncope from the double-blind studies, and an 84% reduction in
the studies where the control group did not receive a pacemaker. [301]

In general, pacing was ineffective in trials that enrolled patients without an asystolic tilt response. [299][,][300] All of these studies have limitations, and a direct comparison is somewhat difficult because of
important differences in study design, largely focused on patient
selection. Overall, in typical vasovagal populations, pacing seems to
have marginal efficacy.
The rationale for the efficacy of cardiac pacing is that the cardioinhibitory reflex is dominant in some patients, as there is no role for
pacing in the preventing vasodilatation and hypotension. In a substudy
of the ISSUE-3 trial, [302] an asystolic response during tilt testing predicted a similar asystolic form during spontaneous ILR-documented
syncope, with a positive predictive value of 86%. In the tilt subgroup
of the SUP 2 study, [292] among 38 patients with dominant cardioinhibitory reflex (with a mean asystolic pause of 22 ± 16 s) the estimated
rates of syncope recurrence with pacing were 3% at 1 year, 17% at 2
years, and 23% at 3 years; these figures were significantly lower than
the corresponding rates observed in untreated controls, and were
similar to those observed in patients with CSS or with ECGdocumented asystole. In a recent multicentre crossover RCT performed in 46 patients aged >40 years, affected by severely recurrent
(>5 episodes during life) cardioinhibitory VVS, [303] during 24-month
follow-up, syncope recurred in 4 (9%) patients treated with a dual

Despite the lack of large RCTs, there is sufficient evidence that
dual-chamber cardiac pacing should be considered to reduce
syncopal recurrences in patients affected by dominant cardioinhibitory CSS.


Two variables are well known to hamper the efficacy of pacing therapy in CSS: the mixed forms [93][,][98] [(see also Web Practical Instructions](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)
section 5) and the association with positivity of tilt testing. Patients
who have positive tilt tests have a three-fold greater probability of
syncope recurrence after dual chamber pacing than those with negative tilt tests [293][,][295] ; thus, when tilt testing is positive, caution must be
recommended over pacemaker implantation.

ESC Guidelines 1917


chamber pacemaker with closed-loop stimulation compared with 21
(46%) patients who had received a sham pacemaker programmed off
(P=0.0001).
Adding video recording to tilt testing, Saal et al. [205] recently
showed, in patients with asystole, that asystole occurred 3 s
before syncope or later in one-third of patients, in whom cardioinhibition was too late to have primarily caused syncope; in the other
two-thirds of asystolic tilt responses, the cause must have been
mainly cardioinhibition or a combination of cardioinhibition and
vasodepression.
The clinical presentation is probably as important as tilt test
positivity when selecting patients who can benefit from cardiac
pacing. The SUP 2 study population was characterized by higher
mean age, history of recurrent syncope beginning in middle or
older age, and frequent injuries, probably due to presentation
without warning. [292]

Owing to the contrasting results of the randomized trials, the
estimated benefit of dual-chamber pacing in cardioinhibitory
tilt-positive patients is weak. Divergence of opinion exists
among experts. Further research is very likely to have an
important impact on recommendations. Conversely, there is
strong consensus that pacing cannot be offered to patients
with non-cardioinhibitory tilt-positive response, and further
tests (e.g. ILR) are warranted to document the mechanism of
the spontaneous reflex.

5.2.6.4 Evidence from trials in patients with adenosine-sensitive syncope
Under this term, classified as a non-classical form of reflex syncope in Table 3, different clinical conditions are included, which
have a supposed role of adenosine in the genesis of syncope in

common.

A new clinical entity, called idiopathic AV block, has recently
been described in patients with a long history of syncope and in
whom paroxysmal AV block could be recorded at the time of syncope recurrence. [5] These patients had an otherwise normal heart
and no sign of conduction disease on ECG and EPS; they had very
low plasma adenosine levels and a high induction rate of transient
complete heart block during exogenous injections of adenosine.
No syncope recurrence was observed after permanent cardiac
pacing over very long periods of follow-up and there was no per
manent AV block.

Similarly, the entity of ‘low-adenosine syncope’ has recently
been described in patients who have an otherwise unexplained
syncope with sudden onset without prodrome, a normal heart,
and normal ECG. [4] The clinical, laboratory, and biological features
of these patients are similar to those observed in patients
affected by idiopathic paroxysmal AV block. Unlike in VVS, tilt
testing is usually negative. [4][,][226] No syncope recurrence was
observed after permanent cardiac pacing in 10 patients who had
ECG documentation of asystolic pause due to sinus arrest or AV
block. [286]

In a small multicentre trial [227] performed in 80 highly selected elderly patients with unexplained unpredictable syncope who had a pos


dual-chamber cardiac pacing significantly reduced the 2-year syncope
recurrence rate from 69% in the control group to 23% in the active

group.

There is weak evidence that dual-chamber cardiac pacing
may be useful in reducing recurrences of syncope in patients
with the clinical features of adenosine-sensitive syncope.
The documentation of possible bradyarrhythmia in spontaneous syncope remains the preferred eligibility criterion for

pacing.

5.2.6.5 Choice of pacing mode
In CSS, a few small controlled studies [304][,][305] and one registry [306]

showed that dual-chamber pacing is better than the single chamber
ventricular mode in counteracting BP fall during CSM and in preventing symptom recurrences. Even if the quality of evidence is weak,
dual-chamber pacing is widely preferred in clinical practice.
In patients with VVS, dual-chamber pacing was used mostly with
a rate drop response feature that instituted rapid dual-chamber
pacing if the device detected a rapid decrease in HR. A comparison between dual-chamber closed-loop stimulation and conventional dual-chamber pacing has been performed by means of a
crossover design in two small studies; these studies showed fewer
syncope recurrences with closed-loop stimulation, both in the
acute setting during repeated tilt testing [307] and during 18-month
clinical follow-up. [308]

5.2.6.6 Selection of patients for pacing and proposed algorithm
The fact that pacing is effective does not mean that it is always necessary. In patients with reflex syncope, cardiac pacing should be the last
choice and should only be considered in highly selected patients, i.e.
those >_40 years of age (mostly >60 years), affected by severe forms
of reflex syncope with frequent recurrences associated with a
high risk of injury, often due to the lack of prodrome. [186] While there
is growing scepticism over the diagnostic accuracy of tilt testing for
syncope diagnosis, emerging evidence supports the use of tilt testing
for the assessment of reflex hypotensive susceptibility [132], which may be
considered to identify patients with an associated hypotensive
response who would be less likely to respond to permanent cardiac
pacing (see section 4.2.2.2). In a meta-analysis [309] of individual patient
data from four studies performed in patients with asystolic reflex
syncope documented by an ILR, the estimated 3-year recurrence
rate of syncope was 2% (95% CI ± 4%) in tilt-negative patients and
33% (95% CI ± 20%) in tilt-positive patients; a positive tilt test
response was the only significant predictor of syncope recurrence
with a hazard ratio of 4.3. Patients with hypotensive susceptibility
should need measures directed to counteract hypotensive susceptibility in addition to cardiac pacing, e.g. the discontinuation/reduction
of hypotensive drugs and the administration of fludrocortisone or

midodrine.

The algorithm shown in Figure 11 has recently been prospectively
validated in a multicentre pragmatic study, which showed a low
recurrence rate of syncope with pacing of 9% at 1 year and 15% at 2
years, significantly lower than the 22% and 37%, respectively,
observed in unpaced controls. [186]


Owing to the contrasting results of the randomized trials, the
estimated benefit of dual-chamber pacing in cardioinhibitory
tilt-positive patients is weak. Divergence of opinion exists
among experts. Further research is very likely to have an
important impact on recommendations. Conversely, there is
strong consensus that pacing cannot be offered to patients
with non-cardioinhibitory tilt-positive response, and further
tests (e.g. ILR) are warranted to document the mechanism of
the spontaneous reflex.

5.3 Treatment of orthostatic hypotension
and orthostatic intolerance syndromes
Current management strategies for OH are summarized in Figure 12.

5.3.1 Education and lifestyle measures
Education regarding the nature of the condition in conjunction with the
lifestyle advice outlined in section 5.2.1 can markedly improve orthostatic symptoms, even though the rise in BP is relatively small (10–15
mmHg); raising standing BP to just within the autoregulatory zone can
make a substantial functional difference. Ambulatory BP recordings may
be helpful in identifying abnormal diurnal patterns. These recordings may
also help identify supine or nocturnal hypertension in treated patients.

5.3.2 Adequate hydration and salt intake
The expansion of extracellular volume is an important goal. In the
absence of hypertension, patients should be instructed to have a sufficient



chloride. [310] Rapid ingestion of cool water is reported to be effective in
combating orthostatic intolerance and postprandial hypotension. [311]

5.3.3 Discontinuation/reduction of vasoactive drugs

Several studies that have evaluated the association of vasoactive

drugs (i.e. any antihypertensive agents, nitrates, diuretics, neuroleptic
antidepressants, or dopaminergic drugs) with OH and falls
have yielded contrasting results. [312] However, intensely prescribed
antihypertensive therapy can increase the risk of OH. Intensive antihypertensive treatment can be defined as higher doses of antihypertensive medications, an increased number of antihypertensive
drugs, or lowering BP to a target <140/90 mmHg. The total
number of BP-lowering medications [313] or the use of three or more
antihypertensive drugs may be a significant predictor of OH. [314]

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptors
blockers, and calcium channel blockers are less likely to be associated
with OH compared with beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics. [315][–][318]

lifestyle advice outlined in section 5.2.1 can markedly improve orthostatic symptoms, even though the rise in BP is relatively small (10–15
mmHg); raising standing BP to just within the autoregulatory zone can
make a substantial functional difference. Ambulatory BP recordings may
be helpful in identifying abnormal diurnal patterns. These recordings may
also help identify supine or nocturnal hypertension in treated patients.


5.3.2 Adequate hydration and salt intake
The expansion of extracellular volume is an important goal. In the
absence of hypertension, patients should be instructed to have a sufficient
salt and water intake, targeting 2–3 L of fluids per day and 10 g of sodium

1920 ESC Guidelines



The principal treatment strategy in drug-induced autonomic
failure is eliminating the offending agent. The quality of evidence is moderate. Longer-term future RCTs are likely to have

an important impact on determining the net risk benefit ratio
of the withdrawal of culprit medications.

5.3.4 Counter-pressure manoeuvres
PCM such as leg crossing and squatting should be encouraged in
patients with warning symptoms who are able to perform them. [319]

5.3.5 Abdominal binders and/or support stockings
Gravitational venous pooling in older patients can be treated with
abdominal binders or compression stockings. [23][,][320][,][321]

5.3.6 Head-up tilt sleeping
Sleeping with the head of the bed elevated (>10 degrees) prevents
nocturnal polyuria, maintains a more favourable distribution of body
fluids, and ameliorates nocturnal hypertension. [104][,][322][,][323]

5.3.7 Midodrine

The alpha-agonist midodrine is a useful addition to first-line treatment
in patients with chronic autonomic failure. It cannot be regarded as a
cure, nor is it helpful in all affected patients, but it is very useful in

some. There is no doubt that midodrine increases BP both in the

supine and upright posture, and ameliorates the symptoms of OH.
Midodrine (2.5–10 mg t.i.d) was shown to be effective in three
randomized placebo-controlled trials. [324][–][326]

The desirable effects of midodrine outweigh the undesirable
effects. The quality of evidence is moderate and further research



5.3.8 Fludrocortisone

Fludrocortisone (0.1–0.3 mg once daily) is a mineralocorticoid that
stimulates renal sodium retention and expands fluid volume. [327] The

evidence in favour of fludrocortisone is from two small observational

studies (in combination with head-up sleeping) and one double-blind
trial in 60 patients; the observational studies showed haemodynamic
benefit and, in the trial, treated patients were less symptomatic with
higher BP. [322][,][327][,][328]

The desirable effects of fludrocortisone outweigh the undesirable
effects. The quality of evidence is moderate and further research
is likely to have an important impact on the estimate of benefit.

5.3.9 Additional therapies
Additional and less frequently used treatments, alone or in combination, include desmopressin in patients with nocturnal polyuria,
octreotide in postprandial hypotension, erythropoietin in anaemia,
pyridostigmine, the use of walking sticks, frequent small meals, and
the judicious exercise of leg and abdominal muscles, especially swimming. Their efficacy is less established. [104]

5.3.10 Emerging new pharmacological therapy in specific
subgroups
Droxidopa, a precursor of norepinephrine, is a centrally and peripherally acting alpha/beta-agonist approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of symptomatic neurogenic OH.
Droxidopa has recently been investigated for the treatment of neurogenic OH in four short-term RCTs [329][–][332] with a total of 485
patients. They showed a modest increase in standing systolic BP and
the symptom benefit of droxidopa over placebo regarding some
items of quality of life after 2 weeks of treatment, but its benefit was

ESC Guidelines 1921


5.4.1.1 Sinus node disease

In general, cardiac pacemaker therapy is indicated and has proved

effective in intrinsic sinus node disease when intermittent sinus arrest

or sinoatrial block has been demonstrated to account for syncope by
means of ECG documentation during spontaneous syncope. [334][–][338]

A frequent situation is that of patients who have prolonged sinus
pause following the termination of tachycardia in bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome due to the abnormally prolonged time
needed for the recovery of automaticity by a diseased sinus node.
Permanent pacing does not affect survival.

When the correlation between symptoms and ECG is established, there is general consensus that cardiac pacing is effective and useful for symptom relief.
In the absence of the above situations, despite adequate pacing, syncope recurs in approximately 15–28% of patients at 5 years [339][–][341]

[(see Supplementary Data Table 9). This is due to the frequent associa-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy037#supplementary-data)
tion of a vasodepressor reflex mechanism with sinus node disease. In
patients with sinus node disease and syncope, carotid sinus hypersensitivity and a positive response to tilt are present in <_50% of patients.
Thus, an increased susceptibility to neurally mediated bradycardia/
hypotension is often the cause of syncope. [135][,][136] A reflex mechanism
of syncope fits well with the unpredictable natural history of syncope
recurrence. Physicians should be aware that effectiveness of therapy is
not well documented in such cases. From a practical perspective, cardiac pacing may be a reasonable solution in patients affected by sinus
node disease, who have had documentation of an asymptomatic ventricular pause >3 s (with exceptions for young trained persons, during
sleep, and medicated patients), when a competitive diagnosis, i.e.
hypotension, can be ruled out. [294] An abnormal SNRT enhances the
probability of efficacy of cardiac pacing (see section 4.2.6.1). [210][–][212]

When the correlation between symptoms and ECG is not
established, cardiac pacing may be reasonable in patients with
intrinsic sinus node disease, syncope, and documentation of
asymptomatic pause(s).
The elimination of drugs that may exacerbate or unmask an underlying susceptibility to bradycardia is an important element in preventing
syncope recurrence. Percutaneous cardiac ablative techniques for
the control of atrial tachyarrhythmia have become of increasing
importance in selected patients with the bradycardia-tachycardia
form of sick sinus syndrome, but are infrequently used for the prevention of syncope.

5.4.1.2 Atrioventricular conduction system disease
Cardiac pacing is the treatment of syncope associated with symptomatic AV block (Figure 13). Although formal RCTs of pacing in thirdor second-degree type 2 AV block have not been performed, some
observational studies suggest that pacing is highly effective in preventing syncope recurrences when AV block is documented. Langenfeld
et al. [341] observed a decline in the rate of syncope from 44 to 3.4%
over 5-year follow-up in 115 patients paced for AV block; the recurrence rate was 7% in the subgroup with syncope before pacemaker
implantation. More recently, Sud et al. [200] reported no syncope recurrence, and Aste et al. [255] reported a recurrence of 1% at 5 years after
pacemaker implantation among 73 patients with documented

5.4.1.3 Bundle branch block and unexplained syncope
The presence of bifascicular BBB suggests that the cause of syncope
may be complete heart block. Nevertheless, less than half of the
patients with bifascicular BBB and syncope will have a final diagnosis
of AV block, a similar percentage will have a final diagnosis of reflex
syncope, and, in approximately 15%, the cause will remain unexplained at the end of a complete workup. [342] In addition, among
patients receiving an ILR, approximately half remained free of syncope for >2 years after the implantation. [187][,][188][,][342][,][343] Conversely,
implantation of a pacemaker without documentation of AV block
(empirical pacing) exposed patients to the risk of recurrence of syncope in about one-quarter of cases during long-term follow-up and
was unnecessary in another half. [217][,][344] Thus, only one in four pacemakers will finally be appropriate. Finally, pacemaker treatment has
not been proven to have a survival benefit. The above considerations
justify a class IIb indication in the ESC Guidelines on pacing. [294]

—
To overcome the above problems, ESC Guidelines on pacing [294]
in patients with LVEF >35%—recommend a strategy of EPS followed
by ILR if the EPS findings are unremarkable. With this strategy, a pacemaker was implanted in approximately half of the patients and these
patients had syncope recurrence after pacemaker implantation in
0–7% of cases [188][,][217] . This strategy was safe; however, this Task Force
recognizes that in the ‘real world’, an empirical pacemaker may be
acceptable in selected patients at high risk of traumatic recurrence


Even if the quality of evidence is moderate, there is strong consensus that in patients with bifascicular BBB with a positive EPS
or documentation of paroxysmal AV block during prolonged
ECG monitoring, cardiac pacing is highly effective in preventing
syncope recurrence. The evidence of efficacy of empirical pacing strategy is weak and the estimate of benefit is uncertain.
Although syncope is not associated with an increased incidence of sudden death in patients with preserved cardiac function, a high incidence
of total deaths (about one-third sudden) was observed in patients with
BBB and heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, or low ejection
fraction. [345][–][347] Indeed, the high total and sudden mortality seems to be
mainly related to underlying structural heart disease and ventricular
tachyarrhythmias. In this latter situation, syncope is a risk factor, rather
than the cause, of death. [218] Unfortunately, ventricular programmed
stimulation does not seem to identify these patients correctly, and the
finding of inducible ventricular arrhythmia (VA) should therefore be
interpreted with caution. [345][,][346] Therefore, an implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) or a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator is
indicated in patients with BBB, congestive heart failure, or previous
myocardial infarction and depressed systolic function for the prevention of SCD, but may be unable to prevent the recurrence of syncope,
which is often due to non-arrhythmic causes such as OH or vasodepressor reflex. The strategy for the management of patients with unexplained syncope and BBB is summarized in Figure 14.

Current management strategies in patients with syncope due to
intrinsic cardiac tachyarrhythmia are summarized in Figure 15.

ESC Guidelines 1923


5.4.2.1 Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
In patients with paroxysmal AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia, AV reentrant tachycardia, typical atrial flutter, and ectopic tachycardia
associated with syncope, catheter ablation is the first-choice treatment. In these patients, the role of drug therapy is limited to being a
bridge to ablation or being used when ablation has failed. In patients
with syncope associated with atrial fibrillation or atypical left atrial


5.4.2.2 Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia
Syncope due to torsade de pointes is not uncommon and is, in its
acquired form, the result of drugs that prolong the QT interval.
Treatment is the immediate discontinuation of the suspected drug.
Catheter ablation or drug therapy is recommended in patients
with syncope due to VT in the presence or absence of structural
heart disease in order to prevent syncope recurrence (Figure 15).

with VT can be found in the 2015 ESC Guidelines for VA and the prevention of SCD. [46]

An ICD is indicated in patients with syncope and depressed cardiac
function, and VT or VF without correctable cause. Although ICD
may not prevent syncope recurrence in these patients, [31][,][348] it is indicated to reduce the risk of SCD (refer to the 2015 ESC Guidelines


patients with syncope and previous myocardial infarction who have
VT induced during EPS [346] (see section 4.2.6).
In patients with preserved systolic function, the indication for ICD
is weaker because trials have not addressed this specific issue.
However, when VT causes syncope, this Task Force believes that an
ICD is warranted if catheter ablation and pharmacological therapy
have failed or could not be performed (Figure 15).

ESC Guidelines 1925


5.5 Treatment of syncope secondary to
structural cardiac, cardiopulmonary, and
great vessel disease
Cardiac syncope is diagnosed when syncope presents in patients with
severe aortic stenosis, acute myocardial infarction/ischaemia, HCM,
cardiac masses (atrial myxoma, ball thrombus, etc.), pericardial disease/tamponade, congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries, prosthetic valve dysfunction, pulmonary embolus, acute aortic dissection,
and pulmonary hypertension (see section 4.1.1). Structural cardiac or
cardiopulmonary disease can be present in some patients with syncope, and its incidence increases in older patients. The mere presence
cope; in others, such as those with inferior myocardial infarction or
aortic stenosis, the underlying cardiac disease may play a role in triggering or potentiating a reflex mechanism, and—finally—the underlying cardiac disease may be the substrate for conduction disturbances,
supraventricular arrhythmia, or VA that causes syncope.

Even in the absence of specific trials, there is strong consensus
that with syncope secondary to structural cardiac disease, the
goal of treatment is not only to prevent syncopal recurrence, but
to treat the underlying disease and decrease the risk of death.

5.6 Treatment of unexplained syncope in
patients at high risk of sudden cardiac
death

The underlying clinical situation is that of a patient being evaluated for
ICD implantation because they are affected by syncope(s) supposedly
due to transient self-terminating ventricular tachyarrhythmias (fast VT or
VF), which have not yet been documented because of their short duration. [349] Syncope due to documented VT/VF is outside the scope of this
section; please refer to section 5.4.2. General guidance may be sought in
the 2015 ESC Guidelines for VA and the prevention of SCD. [46]

5.6.1 Definition

In general, a history of syncope in patients with structural heart
disease or inheritable arrhythmia syndromes is associated with a
two- to four-fold increased risk of death, [348][,][350][–][353] but varies
between specific conditions. [354][–][356] Moreover, there have been
very few studies on ICDs in patients with syncope associated with
left ventricular dysfunction, [31][,][348] cardiomyopathy, or inheritable
arrhythmia syndromes. [357] In these Guidelines, we complement
previous ESC Guidelines for VA and the prevention of SCD [46] by
providing a precise definition of unexplained syncope, and making
recommendations for its investigation and management in different clinical settings.

 - [For this section,][ ‘unexplained syncope][‘ is defined as syncope that]
does not meet any class I diagnostic criterion defined in the
tables of recommendations in section 4. In the presence of clinical features described in this section, unexplained syncope is considered a ‘suspected arrhythmic syncope’.

When the mechanism of syncope is non-arrhythmic, the management of patients at high risk of SCD is the same as for patients with
out syncope.


5.6.2 Left ventricular systolic dysfunction

The benefit of an ICD to reduce the risk of death is established. Thus,

patients with unexplained syncope who have an established ICD indication per current Guidelines [46] must receive an ICD before, and
independently of, the evaluation of the mechanism of syncope, even if
the mechanism of syncope is unknown or uncertain at the end of a
complete workup. While this strategy may help to prolong life,
patients often remain at risk of recurrent syncope, implying a need
for precise identification of the mechanism of syncope and specific
treatment when possible.
Few data exist concerning the prevalence and the prognostic implications of unexplained syncope in unselected patients with left ventricular dysfunction or non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy with

less severe systolic impairment who do not meet the current indication for ICD. [358] Data from observational studies in selected cohorts

show a high rate of occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, ICD discharge, and death in patients with a history of unexplained syncope
but, owing to a lack of control groups, are unable to show the benefit
of an ICD. [27][,][28][,][359][,][360] This Task Force believes that an ICD should be

considered in patients with unexplained syncope with systolic impair
ment but without a current indication for ICD to reduce the risk of

sudden death.

5.6.3 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Unexplained syncope is an independent predictor for SCD and
appropriate ICD discharge. In a systematic review, the average hazard ratio of unexplained syncope (irrespective of definition) was 2.68
(95% CI 0.97–4.38). [361] In the largest multicentre study to date
(>3600 patients with HCM), syncope was an independent predictor
of the composite of SCD and ICD discharge (hazard ratio 2.05, 95%
CI 1.48–2.82). [350] A prophylactic ICD is appropriate in individuals
with other features indicative of a high risk of SCD that are used to
estimate the 5-year risk of SCD using the HCM Risk-SCD model [245] ;
they include: age, family history of SCD, maximum left ventricular

wall thickness, left atrial diameter, and non-sustained VT.



5.6.4 Arrhythmogenic right ventricular
cardiomyopathy
Although limited and diverse, current data suggest that unexplained syncope is a marker of arrhythmic risk in patients with ARVC. [46][,][351][,][362][,][363]

The decision to implant an ICD should take into account the other
known risk factors for arrhythmic events [46] : frequent non-sustained VT,
family history of premature sudden death, extensive right ventricular
disease, marked QRS prolongation, late gadolinium enhancement on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (including left ventricular involvement), left ventricular dysfunction, and VT induction during EPS. [46]

5.6.5 Patients with inheritable arrhythmogenic disorders
5.6.5.1 Long QT syndrome
Syncopal events in long QT syndrome (LQTS) are associated with an
increased risk of subsequent cardiac arrest. The annual rate of SCD in
patients with untreated LQTS is around 0.9% overall and 5% for those
with syncope. [352][,][364] Beta-blocker therapy substantially reduces the risk
of syncope and SCD, but presentation with cardiac arrest and recurrent syncope during beta-blocker therapy is associated with the same
risk of fatal events as in untreated patients. [46] For this reason, ICD treatment should be considered in patients with LQTS and recurrent unexplained syncope despite beta-blocker therapy, especially in cases of
good treatment compliance, in the absence of precipitating factors,
and in LQT2 and LQT3 syndromes. Left cardiac sympathetic denervation should also be considered in this situation, particularly in LQT1. [46]

5.6.5.2 Brugada syndrome
A history of syncope may increase the risk of arrhythmic events up to
two- to three-fold compared with that in asymptomatic patients. In
the largest registry (1029 patients), the incidence of arrhythmic events

ESC Guidelines 1927


(sustained VT or VF, appropriate ICD therapy, or sudden death) in
patients with Brugada syndrome was 7.7% per year in those with a
history of sudden cardiac arrest, 1.9% per year with syncope, and
0.5% per year in asymptomatic patients. [353] However, in a second
study, the rate of appropriate ICD shocks was similar in asymptomatic
patients and in those with syncope, a difference possibly explained by
patient selection and a high rate of non-arrhythmic syncope. [355]


risk factors for arrhythmic events, including spontaneous type 1 Brugada
ECG pattern, family history of sudden death, VF inducibility with one or
two ventricular premature beats during EPS, fractionated QRS, early
repolarization in the peripheral leads, increased T peak– T end interval, and
long PR interval. [220][,][367][–][371] A drug-induced type 1 ECG pattern has a
lower risk of sudden death than a spontaneous type 1 response.

On balance, this Task Force believes that it is reasonable to consider an ICD in the case of unexplained syncope. New studies [356][,][365]

published after the 2015 ESC Guidelines for VA and the prevention of
SCD [46] showed that non-arrhythmic syncope is frequent in Brugada
syndrome and appears to be more benign; thus, ICD should be
avoided in patients with non-arrhythmic syncope that is established
according to the definition reported in this section. ILR is increasingly
used in doubtful cases to exclude a VA as the cause of syncope. [365][,][366]

The final decision to implant an ICD in patients with Brugada syndrome and unexplained syncope should also take into account other


5.6.5.3 Other forms
Due to a lack of studies examining unexplained syncope in other forms
of inheritable arrhythmic diseases such as catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, early repolarization syndrome, and short QT syndrome, this
Task Force is unable to give specific recommendations for the investigation and treatment of unexplained syncope. For further information
refer to the 2015 ESC Guidelines for VA and the prevention of SCD. [46]
### 6. Special issues

6.1 Syncope in patients with comorbidity
and frailty
The approach to the assessment and management of an older patient
with syncope is similar to that of other age groups; however, there
are a number of additional features pertinent to age-related comorbidity and frailty that warrant special attention. [372][–][374]

6.1.1 Comorbidity and polypharmacy
Comorbidity influences the diagnosis of syncope and management
decisions. [33][,][375] Older patients frequently have abnormal findings on
more than one investigation and may have more than one possible
cause of syncope. [372][,][374][,][376] Conversely, coincidental findings of

1928 ESC Guidelines


cardiovascular diagnoses such as aortic stenosis or atrial fibrillation [377]

may not necessarily be the attributable cause of events. [378][–][380]

The prescription of polypharmacy, cardiovascular medications, and
psychotropic (neuroleptics and antidepressants) and dopaminergic
drugs also increases the risk of syncope and falls. [381][–][385] Conversely,
the discontinuation or reduction of hypotensive therapy reduces such
risk. [260] Negative dromotropic and chronotropic medications should
be carefully evaluated in older patients presenting with syncope or falls.
Focal neurological events can occasionally occur due to hypotension and syncope, even in patients without significant carotid artery
stenosis (so called ‘hypotensive TIA’). Although these neurological
events occur in only 6% of patients with recurrent syncope, their misdiagnosis is particularly important because they may lead to a lowering
of BP with antihypertensive medications (e.g. if focal neurology is mistakenly attributed to vascular pathology rather than hypotension), and
to a further increase of the risk of syncope and neurologic events. [386]

Despite the lack of large controlled trials and an overall mod


may not necessarily be the attributable cause of events. [378][–][380]


The prescription of polypharmacy, cardiovascular medications, and
psychotropic (neuroleptics and antidepressants) and dopaminergic
drugs also increases the risk of syncope and falls. [381][–][385] Conversely,
the discontinuation or reduction of hypotensive therapy reduces such
risk. [260] Negative dromotropic and chronotropic medications should

of BP with antihypertensive medications (e.g. if focal neurology is mistakenly attributed to vascular pathology rather than hypotension), and
to a further increase of the risk of syncope and neurologic events. [386]


Despite the lack of large controlled trials and an overall modest quality of studies, there is strong consensus that reduction
or discontinuation of hypotensive drugs and psychotropic drugs
clearly outweighs the undesirable effects (e.g. complications)
of high BP. Further research is likely to have an important
impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect.


6.1.3 Cognitive assessment and physical performance tests
Age-related memory impairment or more established forms of cognitive impairment are frequently associated with poor recall and
therefore the lack of an accurate history of events. In such circumstances, details of prodromal symptoms, whether or not LOC
occurred, and symptoms after the event may be unreliable. [373][,][389][,][391][–][394] Cognitive assessment to inform the accuracy of
historical data, and general physical assessment to identify comorbid
disorders that influence diagnosis and response to treatments (such
as Parkinson’s disease, gait and balance abnormalities, previous
stroke, and polyneuropathies, etc.), are recommended.

Despite the lack of large controlled trials and an overall modest
quality of studies, there is strong consensus that the assessment
of older patients with syncope or unexplained falls may require
cognitive assessment and physical performance tests in addition
to syncope evaluation. Further research is likely to have an
important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect.




6.1.2 Falls

Syncopal events may be unwitnessed in over half of older patients
meaning that collateral histories may not available, which makes discrimination between falls and syncope challenging. [387] If unwitnessed falls are
not due to mechanical slips or trips (i.e. are unexplained or nonaccidental), it is likely that the patient experienced a syncopal event and
displayed lack of awareness for LOC (Figure 16). [388][,][389] Management of
falls in such circumstances is the same as that for syncope. [191][,][194][,][390]

Despite the lack of controlled trials and an overall modest
quality of studies, there is strong consensus that the management of unexplained falls should be the same as that for unexplained syncope.

ESC Guidelines 1929


6.2 Syncope in paediatric patients
6.2.1 Diagnostic evaluation
Diagnostic evaluation in paediatric patients is similar to that in adults.
Two specific conditions [399] occur in early childhood:

 - [Infantile reflex syncopal attacks (also called pallid breath-holding]
spells or reflex anoxic seizures), elicited by a brief unpleasant
stimulus, caused by vagally mediated cardiac inhibition.

 - [Cyanotic breath-holding spells, characterized by stopping]
breathing during crying, leading to cyanosis and usually
TLOC.

Careful taking of personal and family history and a standard
ECG are the most important methods of distinguishing benign
reflex syncope (also including reflex anoxic seizure or breathholding spells) from other causes. If the family history is positive,
genetic causes of electrical disease of the heart should be considered first. Some children with reflex syncope also have a positive
family history. [400] Tilt testing seems to have high false-negative and
false-positive rates and should be used with caution for the primary identification of reflex syncope. Since tilt protocols commonly used in adults may lack specificity in teenagers, in one study,
a shorter tilt test duration of 10 min at 60 or 70 degrees was used
and showed a specificity of >85%. [401]

In young patients, syncope can rarely be the initial manifestation of
unusual but life-threatening conditions such as LQTS, Kearns–Sayre
syndrome (external ophthalmoplegia and progressive heart block),
Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT,
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, ARVC, HCM, pulmonary arterial
hypertension, myocarditis, arrhythmia after repaired congenital heart
disease, and anomalous origin of a coronary artery.
Some aspects of the history can suggest a cardiac origin, and
should prompt cardiac evaluation.

 - [Family history: premature SCD at age <40 years and/or familial]

heart disease.

 - [Known or suspected heart disease.]

 - [Event triggers: loud noise, fright, and/or extreme emotional]

stress.

 - [Syncope during exercise, including swimming.]

 - [Syncope without prodromes, while supine or sleeping, or pre-]
ceded by chest pain or palpitations.

6.2.2. Therapy
The therapeutic approach is the same as in adults. However, it should
be stressed that the effectiveness of pharmacological agents and tilt
training for recurrent reflex syncope is undetermined in the absence
of well-designed paediatric trials. Furthermore, even in the presence
of VVS with prolonged asystole, pacemakers should be avoided due
to the relatively transient and benign nature of the syndrome. [402]

In summary, the key points for the evaluation of syncope in paedi
atrics are as follows:

 - [Syncope in childhood is common, the majority being of reflex]
origin, with only a minority having a potentially life-threatening

cause.

 - [Discriminating benign from serious causes is made primarily by]




 - [Children with a history suggesting VVS, a normal ECG, and no]
family history of arrhythmia should not undergo further cardiac
investigations.

 - [The cornerstone of therapy for young patients with reflex syn-]
cope includes education and reassurance.
### 7. Psychogenic transient loss of consciousness and its evaluation

In psychogenic TLOC there is no gross somatic brain dysfunction,
but the attacks fulfil the criteria for TLOC (see section 3.1). There
are two types: PPS and PNES. In PPS movements are absent, so
PPS resembles syncope or longer-lasting LOC, whereas in PNES
impressive limb movements mean the attacks resemble epileptic
seizures. PPS and PNES differ pathophysiologically from the
TLOC forms that they resemble: in PPS, BP and HR are normal or
high rather than low, and the EEG is normal instead of showing
the slowing or flattening typical of syncope; in contrast to epileptic
seizures, the EEG in PNES shows no epileptiform brain activity
during an attack. [9][,][116]

The frequency of PPS and PNES probably depends on the
setting. The rate of PPS varies from 1% of patients referred to
general syncope clinics [94] to 8% of patients referred to specialist
neurological clinics, [116] but PPS is probably insufficiently
recognized. [154]

7.1 Diagnosis

7.1.1 Historical criteria for attacks

The presence of a psychological trauma is not a prerequisite for a
diagnosis of conversion. The diagnosis of PPS rests on positive clues
taken from the patient’s history and from documenting normal EEG
results, HR, or BP during an attack. History taking in PPS usually
reveals a combination of the following features [116][,][154][,][403] :

(1) In most cases, the duration of PPS is as short as in syncope, but a

much longer duration is a useful diagnostic finding: patients may lie

immobile on the floor for 15–30 min.

(2) The eyes are usually open in epileptic seizures and syncope but are

usually closed in psychogenic TLOC.

(3) The attack frequency is high, with several attacks occurring over a

week or in a day.

(4) There is usually no recognisable trigger, and no sweating, pallor, or

nausea beforehand.

(5) Injury does not exclude PNES or PPS.

These features should occur together in most attacks. The presence of another pattern of features suggesting a true syncope type,
usually VVS, does not argue against a diagnosis of PPS.

7.1.2 Documentation of key features during an attack
The following features are relevant during an attack:

 - [Video recording or clinical observation, including provocation of]
an attack during tilt testing. Primary features: sleep-like body position with closed eyes and lack of response to speech or touch, if



- [Infantile reflex syncopal attacks (also called pallid breath-holding]
spells or reflex anoxic seizures), elicited by a brief unpleasant
stimulus, caused by vagally mediated cardiac inhibition.

- [Cyanotic breath-holding spells, characterized by stopping]
breathing during crying, leading to cyanosis and usually
TLOC.

tested. Secondary features: subtle signs incompatible with LOC
such as eyelid flicker, eyeball movements, swallowing, intact
muscle tone, normal movements absent in true unconsciousness,
and resistance to eye opening.

- [BP: normal or elevated during TLOC.]

- [EEG: normal waking eye-closed EEG pattern, i.e. usually with]
alpha activity, during TLOC.

The gold standard for PPS is documenting an attack with a home
video recorder or with a tilt testing during which BP, HR, and EEG
are normal. [116][,][204][,][404] The gold standard for PNES is documenting an
attack with video-EEG monitoring. [204][,][404]

7.1.2.1 Management of psychogenic pseudosyncope
Announcing a psychological diagnosis to patients may be considered
difficult, but is necessary for reasons of honesty and as the first step of
treatment. [404] It should be done by the somatic specialist who diagnoses

[116][,][404] Important aspects are to assure patients that they are taken
seriously and that attacks are as involuntary as syncope or an epileptic
seizure. Acceptance of the diagnosis by patients may be critical for therapy. In one observational study, [405] communicating and explaining the
diagnosis resulted in an immediate reduction of attack frequency, with
39% of patients being asymptomatic during a mean follow-up period of
[4 years. Some advice on how to inform the patient is provided in Web](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071)

Cognitive behavioural therapy is the usual treatment of PNES and
PPS, if attacks remain present after explanation. One pilot randomized treatment trial, conducted in PNES, [406] showed that psychological therapy provided more attack reduction than no treatment or
treatment with sertraline. There are currently no trials on PPS.


### 8. Neurological causes and mimics of syncope

This section discusses neurological disorders causing syncope or
resembling it, and tests to be performed in patients with syncope.

8.1 Clinical conditions

8.1.1 Autonomic failure

Neurological evaluation should be considered in OH due to autonomic failure. Warning signs are early impotence, disturbed micturition, hyposmia, rapid eye movement, sleep behaviour
disorders, [408][,][409] Parkinsonism, ataxia, cognitive impairment, and sensory deficits. A multidisciplinary approach may be required in secondary autonomic failure and in drug-induced OH, depending on the
underlying disease.

8.1.2 Epilepsy and ictal asystole
Table 10 provides a number of clues that aid the differentiation of
syncope from epileptic seizures. [9][,][50][,][410][,][411] Epilepsy and syncope
may evoke one another on rare occasions, resulting in epileptic
seizures triggering syncope as well as syncope triggering an epileptic seizure. The first form concerns ictal asystole. Whereas approximately 90% of all epileptic seizures are accompanied by
tachycardia, ictal bradycardia and asystole occur in 0.3–0.5% of
seizures. [412][,][413] Bradycardia precedes asystole and AV block may
occur, resembling the ECG pattern of reflex syncope. [412][,][414]

Epileptic asystole occurs during partial complex seizures, not during generalized seizures. Epileptic asystole occurs in only a fraction
of the seizures of one person, and then occurs after a variable
interval of 5–100 s from seizure onset. [415][,][416] If asystole lasts for
more than about 8 s, syncope ensues. [416] A typical history is for a
partial complex seizure to progress as usual for that patient, and
then the patient suddenly falls flaccidly, with or without brief myoclonic jerking. [416][,][417] Ictal bradycardia, asystole, and ictal AV block
are likely self-terminating, [412] and are due to vagal activation
brought about by the seizure. Cessation of cortical activity due to
syncopal cerebral hypoperfusion will end the seizure. Therapy
requires anti-epileptic drugs and possibly a pacemaker. [418]

Ictal asystole is probably not involved in sudden death in epilepsy,
as this typically occurs in patients after unwitnessed nocturnal
generalized tonic-clonic seizures, i.e. another type of epilepsy. [414][,][419] Note that most cases of sudden cardiac arrest in
patients with epilepsy are due to cardiovascular disease and not to
ictal asystole. [420]

The second form concerns a syncopal epileptic seizure.
Hypoxia can trigger epileptic seizures. [208][,][421] Such syncopal epileptic seizures have been described in infants with reflex syncope
or cyanotic breath-holding spells. A typical syncopal spell
suddenly transforms into prolonged clonic movements that
last for minutes; note that shorter epileptic seizures may remain

unnoticed.

8.1.3 Cerebrovascular disorders

In general, a TIA concerns a focal neurological deficit without LOC,
and syncope the opposite. Subclavian steal refers to the rerouting of
blood flow to the arm through the vertebral artery due to proximal


The gold standard for PPS is documenting an attack with a home
video recorder or with a tilt testing during which BP, HR, and EEG
are normal. [116][,][204][,][404] The gold standard for PNES is documenting an
attack with video-EEG monitoring. [204][,][404]

stenosis or occlusion of the subclavian artery. A TIA may occur when
flow through the vertebral artery cannot supply both the arm and
part of the brain during forceful use of the arm. Steal most often
affects the left side. When detected with ultrasound, steal is asymptomatic in 64% of cases. [422] A TIA is likely due to steal only when it is
vertebrobasilar (see below) and associated with exercise of one arm.
There are no reliable reports of isolated LOC without focal neurological symptoms and signs in subclavian steal.
A TIA related to a carotid artery does not usually cause TLOC. An
exception concerns orthostatic TIAs, concerning a combination of
multiple stenoses of cerebral arteries and OH. This may rarely result


A TIA of the vertebrobasilar system can cause LOC, but there are
always focal signs, usually limb weakness, gait and limb ataxia, vertigo,
diplopia, nystagmus, dysarthria, and oropharyngeal dysfunction.
Fewer than 1% of patients with vertebrobasilar ischaemia present
with a single presenting symptom. [425]

8.1.4 Migraine
Syncope, presumable VVS, and orthostatic intolerance occur more
often in patients with migraine, who have a higher lifetime prevalence
of syncope and often frequent syncope. [426] In migraineurs, syncope
and migraine attacks rarely occur simultaneously.

1932 ESC Guidelines


8.1.5 Cataplexy
Cataplexy concerns paresis or paralysis triggered by emotions, usually laughter, but also by a range of other triggers. [427] Patients are conscious even when considered unconscious by eyewitnesses, and
there is no amnesia. Cataplexy is a key feature of narcolepsy; other
cardinal symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep-onset
paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Cataplexy may be mistaken
for syncope, but also for PPS: a partial awareness of events may be
present in PPS, and the falls of cataplexy are partly controlled because
paralysis need not be immediately complete.

8.1.6 Drop attacks
The term drop attacks is confusing as it is variably used for
Menie`re’s disease, atonic epileptic seizures, and unexplained
falls. [387] A specific condition also labelled drop attacks concerns
middle-aged women (rarely men) who suddenly find themselves
falling. [428] They usually remember hitting the floor and can stand


up immediately afterwards.


8.2.3 Neurovascular studies

No studies suggest that carotid Doppler ultrasonography is valuable
in patients with typical syncope.

8.2.4 Blood tests

An acute or subacute onset of multidomain autonomic failure suggests a paraneoplastic or autoimmune cause. Screening for specific
paraneoplastic antibodies is recommended: the most common paraneoplastic antibodies are anti-Hu, while others are anti-Purkinje cell
cytoplasmic autoantibody type 2 and anti-collapsin response mediator protein 5. [431] Seropositivity for any of the above-mentioned antibodies may therefore prompt further investigation for occult
malignancy (e.g. whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
tomography). [432]

Seropositivity for antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor
antibodies is the serological hallmark of autoimmune autonomic
ganglionopathy. [433][,][434]









|Recommendations|Classa|Levelb|
|---|---|---|
|Neurological evaluation is indicated<br>when syncope is due to autonomic fail-<br>ure to evaluate the underlying disease.|I|C|
|Neurological evaluation is indicated in<br>patients in whom TLOC is suspected to<br>be epilepsy.|I|C|



8.2 Neurological tests
A schematic comprehensive figure of neurological tests used for
autonomic failure is shown in Figure 17.

8.2.1 Electroencephalography
The results of interictal EEGs are normal in syncope. [410][,][430] An interictal normal EEG cannot rule out epilepsy and the EEG in epilepsy
must always be interpreted in a clinical context. An EEG is not recommended when syncope is the most likely cause of TLOC, but it is
when epilepsy is the likely cause or when clinical data are equivocal.
The EEG is also useful to establish PPS, if recorded during a provoked

attack.

8.2.2 Brain computed tomography and magnetic
resonance imaging
Computed tomography and MRI in uncomplicated syncope should
be avoided. If neurological examination points out Parkinsonism,
ataxia, or cognitive impairment, MRI is recommended. In cases of
contraindication for MRI, computed tomography is recommended to

exclude brain lesions.

|Recommendations|Classa|Levelb|
|---|---|---|
|Brain MRI is recommended if neurological<br>examination indicates Parkinsonism, ataxia,<br>or cognitive impairment.|I|C|

### 9. Organizational aspects

9.1 Syncope (transient loss of
consciousness) management unit
Since the publication of the 2009 ECS Guidelines, the EHRA Task
Force has published a further position statement on the rationale and
requirement for syncope units. [63] The position paper offers a pragmatic approach to the rationale and requirement for a syncope unit.
It is addressed to physicians and others in administration who are




ESC Guidelines 1933





interested in establishing a syncope unit in their hospital so that they
can meet the standards proposed by the ESC, the EHRA, and the
Heart Rhythm Society. The following is the context and evidence for


9.1.1 Definition of a syncope unit
A syncope unit is a facility featuring a standardized approach to the
diagnosis and management of TLOC and related symptoms, with
dedicated staff and access to appropriate diagnostics and therapies.

1934 ESC Guidelines


9.1.2 Definition of syncope specialist
The syncope specialist is defined as one who has responsibility for
the comprehensive management of the patient from risk stratification
to diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up, through a standardized protocol.
A syncope specialist is a physician who has sufficient knowledge of
historical clues and physical findings to recognize all major forms of
TLOC, including mimics, as well as syndromes of orthostatic

intolerance.

9.1.3 Goal of a syncope unit
Although the benefit of a syncope unit or a syncope specialist in the


scientific or economic scrutiny, the consensus is that a dedicated
service (a syncope unit) affords better management of TLOC, from
risk stratification to diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up, and better education and training of stakeholders. Further research is likely to have
an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect.

9.1.4 Model of a syncope unit
The syncope unit should provide minimum core treatments for
reflex syncope and OH, and treatments or preferential access for
cardiac syncope, falls, psychogenic syncope, and epilepsy (Table 12).
The tests and assessments available in the syncope unit are detailed

in Table 13.

|Autonomic function tests|Standing test, Valsalva manoeuvre, deep-breathing test, cold pressor test, and/or established pro-<br>cedures for access to other autonomic function tests|
|Cardiac evaluation|Established procedures for access to echocardiogram, stress test, electrophysiological study, cor-<br>onary angiography|
|Neurological evaluation|Established procedures for access to neurological tests (computed tomography, magnetic reso-<br>nance imaging, EEG, video-EEG)|
|Geriatric evaluation|Established procedures for access to fall risk assessment (cognitive, gait and balance, visual, envi-<br>ronmental) and for gait and balance retraining|
|Psychological or psychiatric evaluation|Established procedures for access to psychological or psychiatric consultancy (mental health<br>problem or psychogenic syncope)|



9.1.5 Access and referrals to a syncope unit
Referral can be direct from family practitioners, EDs, in-hospital and
out-hospital services, or self-referral from the patient. Fast-track
access with a separate waiting list and scheduled follow-up visits is
recommended. In particular, patients at low/intermediate risk admitted to the ED should benefit from such fast-track facilities (so-called
protected discharge or advanced access with an appointment for
early assessment) to reduce hospitalization rates, directly from the
ED or after a short stay in the short observation unit of the ED (see
section 4.1.2).

9.1.6 Outcomes and quality indicators
The EHRA Task Force [63] has developed the following preliminary
quality indicators, based on consensus, as a rough guide for

practitioners:

(1) Absolute rate of undiagnosed TLOC should be reduced by 20%;

(2) Less than 20% of low-/intermediate-risk TLOC patients should be

admitted from the ED;

(3) The syncope unit should have a 20% reduction in costs relative

to usual practice and improved outcomes (i.e. <5% readmissions

for syncope and <20% of paced patients with recurrence at



9.2 The clinical nurse specialist in the
syncope unit

9.2.1 Definition

The syncope unit clinical nurse specialist is defined as an experienced
practitioner who has sufficient knowledge of history features and
physical findings to recognize all major forms of TLOC, as well as syndromes of orthostatic intolerance. The clinical nurse specialist should
work in close collaboration with the syncope specialist. The core
competencies of the clinical nurse specialist include a specialized clinical focus, patient advocacy, education and training, auditing, research,
and inter- and intradisciplinary consultations.

9.2.2 Role and skills of the clinical nurse specialist
The clinical nurse specialist should be skilled in the performance and
interpretation of structured history taking, 12-lead ECG and routine
blood test results, tilt testing, active stand tests, autonomic function
tests, ECG monitoring (Holter and/or external loop recorder),
ABPM, ILR monitoring, and subsequent triaging of patients and monitoring responses to therapy. Other skills will depend on the service
model, e.g. pacemaker interrogation. The clinical nurse specialist may
have responsibility for follow-up clinics for cardiovascular risk factor
management, autonomic function testing and monitoring, management (including education in PCM) of VVS and OH, and follow-up

(Table 14).
The clinical nurse specialist should be key in developing and delivering communication strategies and processes for the syncope unit
for all stakeholders—patients and practitioners—and play a pivotal
role in education and training together with the syncope specialist.
The clinical nurse specialist should be involved in regular auditing and
[collection of data to inform quality indicators. See the video in Web](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071#supplementary-data)

[Practical Instructions section 11.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehy071#supplementary-data)

Although the skill mix of a clinical nurse specialist has not been
exposed to rigorous scientific or economic scrutiny, the consensus is that the clinical nurse specialist should have the necessary skills to deliver assessment and treatment for syncope and
TLOC. Further research is required to establish the benefits.


### 10. Key messages

The ESC Task Force has selected 19 simple rules to guide the diagnosis and management of syncope patients with TLOC according to the
2018 ESC Guidelines on syncope:

Diagnosis: initial evaluation

(1) At the initial evaluation answer the following four key questions:

� Was the event TLOC?

� In cases of TLOC, are they of syncopal or non-syncopal origin?

� In cases of suspected syncope, is there a clear aetiological diagnosis?

� Is there evidence to suggest a high risk of cardiovascular events or

death?

(2) At the evaluation of TLOC in the ED, answer the following three

key questions:

� Is there a serious underlying cause that can be identified?

ESC Guidelines 1937


� If the cause is uncertain, what is the risk of a serious outcome?

� Should the patient be admitted to hospital?

(3) In all patients, perform a complete history taking, physical examina
tion (including standing BP measurement), and standard ECG.

(4) Perform immediate ECG monitoring (in bed or telemetry) in high
risk patients when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope.

(5) Perform an echocardiogram when there is previous known heart

disease, or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope

secondary to cardiovascular cause.

(6) Perform CSM in patients >40 years of age with syncope of unknown

origin compatible with a reflex mechanism.

(7) Perform tilt testing in cases where there is suspicion of syncope due

to reflex or an orthostatic cause.

(8) Perform blood tests when clinically indicated, e.g. haematocrit and

cell blood count when haemorrhage is suspected, oxygen saturation

and blood gas analysis when hypoxic syndromes are suspected, tro
ponin when cardiac ischaemia-related syncope is suspected, and D
dimer when pulmonary embolism is suspected, etc.

Diagnosis: subsequent investigations

9. Perform prolonged ECG monitoring (external or implantable) in

patients with recurrent severe unexplained syncope who have all of

the following three features:

� Clinical or ECG features suggesting arrhythmic syncope.

� A high probability of recurrence of syncope in a reasonable time.

� Who may benefit from a specific therapy if a cause for syncope is

found.

10. Perform EPS in patients with unexplained syncope and bifascicular

BBB (impending high-degree AV block) or suspected tachycardia.

11. Perform an exercise stress test in patients who experience syncope

during or shortly after exertion.

12. Consider basic autonomic function tests (Valsalva manoeuvre and

deep-breathing test) and ABPM for the assessment of autonomic

function in patients with suspected neurogenic OH.

13. Consider video recording (at home or in hospital) of TLOC sus
pected to be of non-syncopal nature.

Treatment

14. To all patients with reflex syncope and OH, explain the diagnosis,

reassure, explain the risk of recurrence, and give advice on how to

avoid triggers and situations. These measures are the cornerstone of

treatment and have a high impact in reducing the recurrence of

syncope.

15. In patients with severe forms of reflex syncope, select one or more of

the following additional specific treatments according to the clinical

features:

� Midodrine or fludrocortisone in young patients with low BP

phenotype.

� Counter-pressure manoeuvres (including tilt training if needed) in

young patients with prodromes.

� ILR-guided management strategy in selected patients without

or with short prodromes.

� Discontinuation/reduction of hypotensive therapy targeting a

systolic BP of 140 mmHg in old hypertensive patients.

� Pacemaker implantation in old patients with dominant



16. In patients with OH, select one or more of the following additional

specific treatments according to clinical severity:

� Education regarding lifestyle manoeuvres.

� Adequate hydration and salt intake.

� Discontinuation/reduction of hypotensive therapy.

� Counter-pressure manoeuvres.

� Abdominal binders and/or support stockings.

� Head-up tilt sleeping.

� Midodrine or fludrocortisone.

17. Ensure that all patients with cardiac syncope receive the specific ther
apy of the culprit arrhythmia and/or of the underlying disease.

18. Balance the benefits and harm of ICD implantation in patients with

unexplained syncope at high risk of SCD (e.g. those affected by left

ventricle systolic dysfunction, HCM, ARVC, or inheritable arrhyth
mogenic disorders). In this situation, unexplained syncope is defined as

syncope that does not meet any class I diagnostic criterion defined in

the tables of recommendations of the 2018 ESC Guidelines on syn
cope and is considered a suspected arrhythmic syncope.

19. Re-evaluate the diagnostic process and consider alternative therapies

if the above rules fail or are not applicable to an individual patient.

Bear in mind that Guidelines are only advisory. Even though they are

based on the best available scientific evidence, treatment should be

tailored to an individual patient’s need.
### 11. Gaps in evidence and areas for future research

Clinicians responsible for managing patients with TLOC must frequently make treatment decisions without adequate evidence or a
consensus of expert opinion. The following is a short list of selected,

common issues that deserve to be addressed in future clinical

research.

Diagnosis: the gap between the best
available scientific evidence and the need
for the dissemination of these concepts
into clinical practice
There is wide variation in the practice of syncope evaluation, and
wide variation in the adoption of recommendations from published guidelines. The absence of a systematic approach to TLOC
incurs higher health and social care costs, unnecessary hospitalizations and diagnostic procedures, prolongation of hospital stays,
lower diagnostic rates, and higher rates of misdiagnoses and symp
tom recurrence.

Therefore, there is a need for:

1) Large clinical studies that assess the diagnostic yield and compliance of a

guideline-based standardized systematic approach

Despite the recommendation from the ESC Guidelines on syncope,

syncope units are not widely established in clinical practice. Barriers to

establishing a syncope unit include lack of resources, lack of trained

dedicated staff, and complex presentations to multiple settings, necessi
tating involvement from multiple disciplines. The evidence for the use
fulness of syncope units is controversial.


Diagnosis: subsequent investigations


9. Perform prolonged ECG monitoring (external or implantable) in

patients with recurrent severe unexplained syncope who have all of

the following three features:

� Clinical or ECG features suggesting arrhythmic syncope.

� A high probability of recurrence of syncope in a reasonable time.

� Who may benefit from a specific therapy if a cause for syncope is

found.

10. Perform EPS in patients with unexplained syncope and bifascicular

BBB (impending high-degree AV block) or suspected tachycardia.

11. Perform an exercise stress test in patients who experience syncope

during or shortly after exertion.

12. Consider basic autonomic function tests (Valsalva manoeuvre and

deep-breathing test) and ABPM for the assessment of autonomic

function in patients with suspected neurogenic OH.

13. Consider video recording (at home or in hospital) of TLOC sus
pected to be of non-syncopal nature.


Treatment


14. To all patients with reflex syncope and OH, explain the diagnosis,

reassure, explain the risk of recurrence, and give advice on how to

avoid triggers and situations. These measures are the cornerstone of

treatment and have a high impact in reducing the recurrence of

syncope.

15. In patients with severe forms of reflex syncope, select one or more of

the following additional specific treatments according to the clinical

features:

� Midodrine or fludrocortisone in young patients with low BP

phenotype.

� Counter-pressure manoeuvres (including tilt training if needed) in

young patients with prodromes.

� ILR-guided management strategy in selected patients without

or with short prodromes.

� Discontinuation/reduction of hypotensive therapy targeting a

systolic BP of 140 mmHg in old hypertensive patients.

� Pacemaker implantation in old patients with dominant

cardioinhibitory forms.

1938 ESC Guidelines


Therefore, there is a need for:

Large clinical studies that test the superiority of management in a dedicated

syncope facility vs. conventional management

Diagnosis: the need for new diagnostic
tests and devices

BP recording is crucial for the majority of clinical TLOC situations
and will yield important information for the treatment of syncope.
Unfortunately, current long-term BP (or surrogate) recording systems are not optimal for diagnostic use in the syncope evaluation

Therefore, there is a need for:

3) Development and validation of new diagnostic multiparametric devices that

can record heart rhythm and BP (and possibly other physiological parameters

such as cerebral saturation or EEG) at the time of a syncopal event.

Treatment: lack of evidence of efficacy of
most available therapies
Only a few small RCTs have been conducted on treatment of syncope.
In addition, syncopal recurrences are unpredictable and often decrease
spontaneously after medical assessment, even in the absence of a specific
therapy. The consequence of the spontaneous decrease is that any therapy for syncope prevention appears to be more effective than it actually
is, making the results of observational data on therapy questionable in
the absence of a control group. No therapy can be effective for all



Therefore, there is strong urgent need for RCTs on the efficacy of:

4) Pharmacological therapies targeted to specific subgroups of reflex syncope.

5) Pacemaker therapy targeted to specific subgroups of cardioinhibitory reflex

syncope.

6) Pharmacological therapies of OH-mediated syncope.

7) ICD therapy targeted to specific subgroups of patients with unexplained syn
cope at risk of SCD.

Treatment: the need for new therapies
There is a need to move towards personalized medicine. Improving
our knowledge of the biochemical mechanisms underlying specific
forms of reflex syncope will allow the development of new therapies
in such specific settings. For example, a low adenosine phenotype
and a low norepinephrine phenotype have been recently identified.

Therefore, there is a need for:

8) Randomized clinical trials on the efficacy of theophylline (and other xantine

antagonists) for low adenosine syncope and norepinephrine transport inhibi
tors for low epinephrine syncope.

Syncope is a transient phenomenon. The ideal therapy should be
one that is administered only when needed.

Therefore, there is a need for:

9) Randomized clinical trials of on-demand administration of specific therapy

based on specific sensors similar to adrenalin injectors in asthma or nasal

spray for paroxysmal SVT.


2) Large clinical studies that test the superiority of management in a dedicated

syncope facility vs. conventional management


Diagnosis: the need for new diagnostic
tests and devices

BP recording is crucial for the majority of clinical TLOC situations
and will yield important information for the treatment of syncope.
