#### 1. Preamble

Guidelines summarize and evaluate available evidence with the aim of

assisting health professionals in proposing the best management strategies for an individual patient with a given condition. Guidelines and
their recommendations should facilitate decision making of health professionals in their daily practice. However, guidelines are not a substitute for the patient’s relationship with their practitioner. The final
decisions concerning an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional(s), based on what they consider to be
the most appropriate in the circumstances. These decisions are
made in consultation with the patient and caregiver as appropriate.
Guidelines are intended for use by health professionals. To ensure

that all users have access to the most recent recommendations, the

ESC makes its Guidelines freely available. The ESC warns readers
that the technical language may be misinterpreted and declines any
responsibility in this respect.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by the
ESC. Because of their impact on clinical practice, quality criteria for the
development of guidelines have been established to make all decisions
transparent to the user. The recommendations for formulating and is[suing ESC Guidelines can be found on the ESC website (https://www.](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[escardio.org/Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official pos-](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
ition of the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.

ESC Guidelines 4237

Table 1 Classes of recommendations











Table 2 Levels of evidence




In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the ESC
carries out the EURObservational Research Programme of international registries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions, which are essential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of resources
and adherence to guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better
understanding of medical practice in Europe and around the world,
based on high-quality data collected during routine clinical practice.
Furthermore, the ESC develops sets of quality indicators (QIs),
which are tools to evaluate the level of implementation of the guidelines and may be used by the ESC, hospitals, healthcare providers and
professionals to measure clinical practice, and in educational programmes, alongside the key messages from the guidelines, to improve quality of care and clinical outcomes.
The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC to represent professionals involved with the medical care of patients with
this pathology. The selection procedure aimed to ensure that there is
a representative mix of members predominantly from across the whole
of the ESC region and from relevant ESC Subspecialty Communities.


Consideration was given to diversity and inclusion, notably with respect
to gender and country of origin. A critical evaluation of diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the
risk–benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and scored
according to predefined scales, as outlined below. The Task Force followed the ESC voting procedures. All recommendations subject to a
vote achieved at least 75% among voting members.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as
real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of
interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest
[rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[Guidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a](http://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
supplementary document simultaneously to the guidelines.
This process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in
the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations
of interest that arise during the writing period were notified to the

4238 ESC Guidelines


ESC and updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support
from the ESC without any involvement from the healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the approval process of these guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive review by the CPG and external experts, including a mix of
members from across the whole of the ESC region and from relevant
ESC Subspecialty Communities and National Cardiac Societies. After
appropriate revisions, the guidelines are signed off by all the experts
involved in the Task Force. The finalized document is signed off by
the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal. The guidelines
were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their writing.
The task of developing ESC Guidelines also includes the creation of
educational tools and implementation programmes for the recommendations, including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary slides,
summary cards for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital
applications (smartphones, etc.). These versions are abridged and thus,
for more detailed information, the user should always access the fulltext version of the guidelines, which is freely available via the ESC website and the European Heart Journal. The National Cardiac Societies of
the ESC are encouraged to endorse, adopt, translate and implement all
ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed because it
has been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.
Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC Guidelines
fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement, as well
as in the determination and the implementation of preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC
Guidelines do not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and accurate
decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition and in
consultation with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each
country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription and to respect the ethical rules of their profession.
Off-label use of medication may be presented in this guideline if
sufficient level of evidence shows that it can be considered medically
appropriate to a given condition and if patients could benefit from
the recommended therapy. However, the final decisions concerning
an individual patient must be made by the responsible health professional giving special consideration to:

(1) the specific situation of the patient. In this respect, it is specified
that, unless otherwise provided for by national regulations, off
label use of medication should be limited to situations where it

is in the patient’s interest to do so, with regard to the quality,
safety and efficacy of care, and only after the patient has been informed and has provided consent;
(2) country-specific health regulations, indications by governmental
drug regulatory agencies and the ethical rules to which health
professionals are subject, where applicable.
#### 2. Introduction

This is the first European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline on
cardio-oncology. The aim of this guideline is to help all the healthcare
professionals providing care to oncology patients before, during, and


after their cancer treatments with respect to their cardiovascular (CV)
health and wellness. This guideline provides guidance on the definitions,
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer therapy-related CV
toxicity (CTR-CVT), and the management of CV disease (CVD)
caused directly or indirectly by cancer. This area of medicine has limited trials and evidence on which to base decision-making and,
where evidence is limited, this guideline provides the consensus of
expert opinion to guide healthcare professionals.
This guideline includes the definitions of CTR-CVT (Section 3), [1] and
provides a personalized approach to care based upon the baseline
CV toxicity risk assessment (Section 4) and new protocols for CV surveillance during cancer treatment (Section 5). The management of acute
CTR-CVT is addressed in Section 6, where patients with activecancer are
those receiving anticancer treatment. Throughout these sections,
decision-making depends upon the risk/benefit balance of oncology
treatment efficacy and the severity and impact of CTR-CVT. Guidance
is provided for the first 12 months after completion of cardiotoxic treatments (Section 7), when subacute CVD can emerge, and when patients
who developed CTR-CVT during cancer treatment are reviewed.
Diagnosis and management of the long-term CV complications of previous oncology treatments, beyond 12 months after completing the cardiotoxic treatments, and integration into the overall survivorship strategy
for cancer survivors (CS) is presented in Section 8 with new long-term
surveillance recommendations for high-risk patients.
In Section 9, we address special populations where CVDs are directly caused by the cancer, or where special considerations are required. Section 10 provides information for patients’ involvement in
their own care. The final section highlights the role of the ESC and
the ESC Council of Cardio-Oncology (ESC-CCO).
CTR-CVT risk is a dynamic variable, and the risk changes through[out the pathway of care (Figure 1, Video 1). Absolute risk of](https://players.brightcove.net/1611106596001/default_default/index.html?videoId=6309381730112)
CTR-CVT is important to understand and balance against the absolute benefit of the cancer treatment before and during treatment.
However, CTR-CVT risk can be influenced by several variables, including implementation of primary prevention treatments, optimization of pre-existing CVD, dose, frequency, and duration of oncology
treatment, emergence of CV complications during treatment and
their severity, and in CS, the overall cumulative treatment received,

the time since treatment, and the interaction with other CVDs.

2.1. Cancer and cardiovascular needs of

patients with cancer
Since the 1990s, there has been a steady decline in cancer-related
mortality mirrored by a steady increase in CS. [2][,][3] In this context,
treatment-related side effects have gained more significance.
Management of CTR-CVT has a tremendous impact on the type of
anticancer therapies that patients can receive as well as the long-term
morbidity and mortality outcomes of patients with cancer. Effective
management of patients with both cancer and CVD requires the unique interest and expertise of healthcare providers, which has led to
the formation of a new discipline: cardio-oncology. [4][,][5] A recently published ESC-CCO document describes appropriate criteria for the organization and implementation of cardio-oncology services. [5]

2.2. Role of cardio-oncology services
The overarching goal of the cardio-oncology discipline is to allow patients with cancer to receive the best possible cancer treatments safely,

survivors; CTR-CVT, cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity; CV, cardiovascular; CVD, cardiovascular disease; CVRF, cardiovascular risk factors; CTR-CVT risk is a dynamic variable that changes through the pathway of care, and is influenced by several conditions including age, cancer
history, pre-existing CVRF or CVD, and previous cardiotoxic cancer therapy. The CTR-CVT risk changes during and after treatment according
to type, dose, frequency, and duration of oncology treatment (blue solid line). Pre-existing CVRF, CVD, or previous cancer treatments may increase
the magnitude of acute and long-term CV toxicity risk (purple solid line). CTR-CVT risk remains variable in extent during anticancer treatment and
may or may not gradually increase over time (dotted lines). Cardio-oncology strategy may reduce the magnitude of CTR-CVT by: (1) optimizing CVD
and CVRF management (green arrows); (2) considering cardioprotective strategies in high-risk patients (green arrows); (3) organizing cancer treatment surveillance; and (4) introducing early cardioprotection after the detection of subclinical CTR-CVT (purple arrows). CV risk assessment within
the first year after completion of cardiotoxic cancer therapy identifies CS who require long-term follow-up. Cancer survivorship programmes that
include annual CV risk assessment and CVRF/CVD management are recommended to minimize long-term CV adverse events (brown arrows).


minimizing CTR-CVT across the entire continuum of cancer care. [5]

Before initiation of cancer therapies with a known CV toxicity profile,
the cardio-oncology team should identify and treat CV risk factors
(CVRF) and pre-existing CVDs and define an appropriate prevention
and surveillance plan for early identification and appropriate management of potential CV complications (Figure 2). Another important aspect is the participation in interdisciplinary discussions regarding the
benefits and risks of certain cancer treatments and their continuation
or interruption should side effects become apparent. After cancer
treatment has been completed, the focus shifts to co-ordination of
long-term follow-up and treatment. For patients on long-term cancer


therapies with CV toxicity risk, surveillance should continue until the
treatment is finished. [6][–][8] There is also the need for re-assessment of
CV risks in patients requiring treatment for secondary malignancies.

2.3. General principles of
cardio-oncology
A guiding principle of cardio-oncology is the integration of clinical disciplines. Cardio-oncology providers must have knowledge of the
broad scope of cardiology, oncology, and haematology management. [5]

Recommendations are formed regarding the most permissible (from a

and echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, or other cardiac imaging tests in selected patients according to baseline CV toxicity risk and cancer
treatment type (see Figure 7). [d] Cardio-oncology referral is recommended when available, alternatively patients should be referred to a specialized cardiologist with expertise in managing CVD in patients with cancer. [e] Annual CV risk assessment (including clinical review, BP, lipid profile,

CVD perspective) and the most effective (from an oncological perspective) cancer treatment. Adjudication of CV events occurring in patients on active therapy is another important aspect of
cardio-oncology practice. [1][,][3] This is in addition to recommendations
on best treatment and management practices. This includes the full


scope of CV therapies, including healthy lifestyle promotion and
pharmacological, device, and surgical treatments. [4][,][9][,][10]

The principle underlying the dynamic course of CTR-CVT development in patients with cancer is that the absolute risk depends on their
baseline risk and changes with exposure to cardiotoxic therapies over

time (Figure 3). [11] This has been recognized in conceptual models, with
risk stratification tools designed to grade patients with cancer into
low, moderate, high, and very high risk of CV complications prior to
starting treatment. These have been published by the Heart Failure
Association (HFA) of the ESC in collaboration with the International
Cardio-Oncology Society (ICOS) (see Section 4). [12][,][13] Severity, duration, and type of manifestation of CTR-CVT vary by type of malignancy and cancer treatment. The risk itself can be understood in
two ways: (1) the likelihood of its occurrence and (2) the severity of
the complication (Figure 4). For example, a patient could be very likely
to experience a CTR-CVT, but if this event is mild, oncology treatment should continue. Conversely, a patient at low likelihood could


still be at high risk according to the severity of the event, which would
lead to interruption of cancer treatment, e.g. a significant decline in
left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (LVEF) to, 40% with anthracycline chemotherapy. The timeline of these developments may also be

rather different. After the cardiotoxic cancer treatment has been

completed, a new risk assessment is recommended to establish different long-term trajectories of CV health. These trajectories are impacted by the permanent CV toxic effects and cardiac or vascular
injury of some cancer therapies, patient-related CVRF, environmental
factors, and stressors (e.g. acute viral infections). The aim should be to
personalize approaches to minimize CTR-CVT and improve both

cancer and CV outcomes.

4242 ESC Guidelines






Figure 4 Dimensions of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity risk and disease severity. CTR-CVT, cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity; CV, cardiovascular. The ultimate risk is the combination of the likelihood (based on reported incidence) and degree (severity or grade) of the adverse
event. The most vulnerable patient groups are those at high likelihood of experiencing a severe adverse event. The level of attention that needs to be
devoted to these patients varies accordingly. The risk and type of CTR-CVT, as well as the potential for reversibility, depends on different factors, listed in
Figure 3, that should be considered to define global CV and oncological prognosis and to individualize CTR-CVT surveillance. Additional factors that add to
the complexity of CTR-CVT risk assessment are the cancer type and prognosis, and type, duration, and intensity of cancer treatment.

#### 3. Cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity definitions

Several terminologies and definitions have previously been proposed
to describe the spectrum of CTR-CVT, leading to inconsistencies in
diagnosis and management. The need to harmonize these definitions
has frequently been stated and recognized, and resulted in the recent
international definitions of CTR-CVT [1] supported by this guideline
[(Table 3; Supplementary data, Table S1). This document will focus](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data)
on consensus definitions for cardiomyopathy and heart failure


(HF), myocarditis, vascular toxicities, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, and corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation. The definitions

of other CTR-CVT, including pericardial and valvular heart diseases

(VHDs), are the same as those used for the general cardiology popu
lation. For cardiac injury, cardiomyopathy, and HF, the descriptive

term cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is recom
mended as it captures the broad spectrum of possible presentations

and the aetiological link with the broad scope of various cancer ther
apies, including chemotherapy, targeted agents, immune therapies,

and radiation therapy.

#### 4. Cardiovascular toxicity risk stratification before anticancer therapy

The optimal time to consider CVD prevention strategies in patients
with cancer is at the time of cancer diagnosis and prior to the initiation of cancer treatment. [4][,][5] This enables the oncology team to consider CV risk while making cancer treatment choices, educating
patients regarding their CV risk, personalizing CV surveillance and
follow-up strategies, and making appropriate referrals of high-risk patients to cardio-oncology services. These strategies are needed to
mitigate CVD risk, and improve the adherence to effective cancer

treatments and the overall survival.


CVD prevention strategies require a personalized approach. Risk
assessment is a challenging task and it is vital that clinicians adopt a
systematic approach without delaying oncological treatment. [12][,][21][,][22]

Figure 5 provides a comprehensive approach to risk assessment.
The choice of the cardiac tests (electrocardiogram [ECG], biomarkers, and imaging) should be individualized based on CV risk and
the planned cancer treatments.

4.1. General approach to cardiovascular
toxicity risk in patients with cancer
Pre-treatment CTR-CVT risk assessment should ideally be performed using a recognized risk stratification method where multiple
risk factors are incorporated to determine patient-specific risk. [23]

should be measured. If GLS assessment is not available, other markers of longitudinal function (e.g. annular Doppler velocity) should be considered.
Cardiac magnetic resonance should be considered if echocardiography is of non-diagnostic quality. [f] Anaemia, infections, electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic problems, other QTc-prolonging drugs. [g] Cardio-oncology referral is recommended when available; alternatively, patients should be referred to a

Only a limited number of retrospective risk scores have been published in patients with cancer. Most of these scores have been developed for specific cancer-patient groups and cannot be readily applied
or extrapolated to other type of malignancies. [24][–][29] While further


validation is needed, HFA-ICOS risk assessment tools should be con
sidered to determine pre-treatment risk of CTR-CVT as they are
easy to use and implement in oncology and haematology services

anthracycline chemotherapy, the total planned cumulative anthracycline dose is also relevant, and ≥250 mg/m [2] of doxorubicin or
equivalent should be considered higher risk (Table 5). [32]

CV risk stratification results should be discussed with the patient
and documented in clinical notes. This process will also enable future

validation of these tools.

Cardiology referral (cardio-oncology programme or cardiologist with expertise in managing CVD in patients with cancer) is


recommended for patients identified to be at high or very high
risk for CTR-CVT at baseline (Table 4) to institute strategies to mitigate risk. [33] Patients at moderate risk can benefit from closer cardiac
monitoring, strict management of traditional CVRF, and selected
moderate-risk patients may also benefit from a cardio-oncology referral (Figure 6). Low-risk patients can be followed within the oncology programme with appropriate referral to cardio-oncology if a
CTR-CVT emerges or new or uncontrolled CVRF appear.

ECG).

4.2. History and clinical examination
A careful clinical history and physical examination is recommended as
part of the baseline risk assessment. Oncology patients can be divided into two cohorts with respect to the presence or absence of
pre-existing CVD. A primary prevention strategy can be considered
in patients without previous CVD or CTR-CVT while secondary


prevention includes interventions in patients with prior or active
CVD or previous CTR-CVT. [12]

Reviewing traditional risk factors for CVD is recommended.
Where present, the efficacy of treatment and control of these modifiable risk factors should be determined to ensure optimal control
during cancer therapy. [4][,][34] Although recent SCORE2 and
SCORE2-OP [19] tables are not focused on patients with cancer, risk
calculation is recommended for patients with cancer .40 years of
age (unless they are automatically categorized as being at high risk
or very high risk based on documented CVD, diabetes mellitus

[DM], kidney disease, or a highly elevated single risk factor) as a reference to optimize CVRF treatment goals. [19][,][31][,][35] A family history of
premature CVD should be considered because genetic abnormalities
associated with CVD may predispose patients with cancer to a higher risk of CTR-CVT. [36][–][38] Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol
consumption, sedentary lifestyle, exposure to pollution, and frailty
are important shared risk factors for both cancer and CVD.
Information on prior history of cancer, cardiotoxic cancer therapies,
and their respective doses should be collected. Patients should be
asked about typical cardiac symptoms (e.g. chest pain with activity,
dyspnoea on exertion, orthopnoea, palpitations, and peripheral oedema), which can guide clinical examination and investigations.
Physical examination should document vital signs and look for potential indicators of undiagnosed CVD such as HF, pericardial disease,
VHD, and arrhythmias. [39][–][42]

The second scenario is secondary prevention in patients with a
prior history of CVD. These patients with cancer are potentially at
high or very high risk of future CV events, [12] and require a more
comprehensive clinical evaluation of their CVD, its severity, and
prior and current treatments. Depending on the type and severity

—
of CVD, additional investigations including resting or stress echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), nuclear perfusion
imaging, and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)

—
may be indicated to determine risk status. Identifying prior CVD
should not automatically be a reason to withhold cancer therapy
but considered an opportunity to optimize CV risk prior to and during treatment. Risk/benefit discussions should include the patient,
oncologist or haematologist, and—where available—a specialized
cardio-oncology service.
Additional factors that add to the complexity of baseline CV risk
assessment are the cancer type and prognosis, and type, duration,
and intensity of cancer treatment (Figure 1). [4][,][12][,][43] Clinical history,
physical examination features, and treatment-related risk factors
that contribute to CTR-CVT for various cancer therapies are sum[marized in Supplementary data, Table S8. These risk factors should](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data)
be collected and considered along with baseline ECG, cardiac serum
biomarkers, and cardiac imaging tests (summarized in Figure 7) to
complete baseline CTR-CVT evaluation.

4.3. Electrocardiogram
A baseline 12-lead ECG is a readily available test that can provide important clues to underlying CVD. ECG evidence of chamber enlargement, conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias, ischaemia, or prior
myocardial infarction (MI), and low voltages should be interpreted
in the clinical context. A baseline ECG is recommended prior to
starting a cancer treatment known to cause QTc prolongation. [44][–][49]

Measurement of QTc using the Fridericia correction (QTcF) is

genetic conditions that prolong QT is recommended (see Section
6.4.2). [45]

Left atrial enlargement on baseline ECG before ibrutinib has
been shown to be a predictor for the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) during chemotherapy. [50][,][51] The presence of atrioventricular (AV) conduction delays and premature atrial complexes
are associated with the development of atrial arrhythmias in patients undergoing autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). [52]

4.4. Cardiac serum biomarkers

The literature on the use of biomarkers for CTR-CVT risk strati
fication before cancer therapy is limited, and recommendations
are mostly based on expert opinion. [12][,][43][,][53][–][55] Four recent position
papers based on collaboration among the Cardio-Oncology Study
Group of the HFA of the ESC, the ESC-CCO, and ICOS have suggested that measurement of cardiac serum biomarkers—cardiac
troponin (cTn) I or T and natriuretic peptides (NP) (e.g. B-type
natriuretic peptide [BNP] or N-terminal pro-BNP

—

[NT-proBNP]) help in baseline CV risk stratification of patients
scheduled for cancer therapies including anthracyclines, human
epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapies, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (VEGFi), proteasome inhibitors (PI), immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), chimeric antigen
receptor T cell (CAR-T) and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
(TIL) therapies, allowing identification of those who may benefit
from cardioprotective therapy. [12][,][43][,][53][,][54] Baseline cardiac serum
biomarker measurements are required if the degree of change in
the biomarkers is to be used to identify subclinical cardiac injury
during cancer treatment.


A few studies of paediatric and adult patients requiring anthracycline chemotherapy have reported that patients with cancer with an increased cTn before treatment were more likely to
develop CTRCD. [56][–][58] However, most published studies have
not reported on the prognostic value of baseline cTn measurements, possibly due to the low prevalence of patients with previous CVD or CVRF in these studies. [55][,][59][,][60] A study of 251
women receiving trastuzumab for early HER2-positive breast
cancer (BC) reported that 19% of the patients who developed
cardiac dysfunction during trastuzumab therapy had positive ultrasensitive troponin I at baseline (.80 ng/L). [61] Furthermore,
baseline high cTnI level was a predictor of lack of recovery despite optimal HF therapy. [61] These findings have been confirmed
in a subsequent study of 533 patients with BC who had serial
high-sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn) I and T measurements during trastuzumab therapy. [62] Increased baseline cTn (.40 ng/L and
.14 ng/L for hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT, respectively) was associated
with a four-fold risk of developing LV dysfunction (LVD). [62]

However, given the high proportion of patients with previous
anthracycline exposure in both studies, these elevated cTn levels
are not a true baseline as they reflect pre-trastuzumab but postanthracycline chemotherapy. It is unclear whether pretreatment cTn levels will be predictive of LVD in patients before
any treatment, or for those BC patients treated with trastuzumab without prior anthracyclines.
NP are another potential biomarker for CV risk stratification.

Several studies have shown the role of NP measurement at baseline
or NP changes to predict future CTR-CVT. [63][–][65] In patients with multiple myeloma (MM), pre-treatment NP may be a predictive marker
for subsequent CV adverse events. In 109 patients with relapsed MM,
BNP . 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP . 125 pg/mL levels before initiation of carfilzomib were associated with an odds ratio of 10.8 for
subsequent CV adverse events. [66] Therefore, baseline NP measurement is recommended in high- and very high-risk patients and should
be considered in low- and moderate-risk patients before PI

treatment.

Baseline elevated values of CV functional peptides (including
NT-proBNP) and hs-cTnT were strongly related to all-cause mortality in 555 patients with different types of tumours, suggesting that
the presence of a subclinical myocardial injury might be directly
linked to disease progression. [67] However, in the CARDIOTOX
(CARDIOvascular TOXicity induced by cancer-related therapies)
registry, in 855 patients treated with a range of oncological treatments, including radiotherapy (RT), both NT-proBNP and cTn elevation at baseline were not associated with the development of severe
CTRCD (LVEF, 40% or clinical HF). [68]

There has also been interest in other novel biomarkers for

CTR-CVT risk stratification before cancer treatment; however,
the literature is limited. Candidates include myeloperoxidase,

–
C-reactive protein, galectin-3, arginine nitric oxide metabolites,
growth differentiation factor-15, placental growth factor,
fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, micro-ribonucleic acids, and immunoglobulin E. [60][,][69][–][71] Currently, there is no evidence to support

routine measurement of these novel biomarkers and more re
search is required.

4.5. Cardiovascular imaging
CV imaging has an important role in identifying patients with subclinical CVD, determining the degree of pre-existing cardiac comorbidity
prior to decisions regarding cancer therapy, and serves as a reference
for identification of changes during treatment and long-term followup. [12][,][54][,][72][–][74] Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the preferred
imaging technique for baseline risk stratification as it provides quantitative assessment of LV and right ventricular (RV) function, chamber dilation, LV hypertrophy, regional wall motion abnormalities,
diastolic function, VHD, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), and pericardial disease, which may influence the therapeutic decision. [22][,][72]

Suggestions for the components of a baseline echocardiography
study are provided in Figure 8.
Current definitions of CTRCD are based on a reduction of LVEF
and/or relative changes in global longitudinal strain (GLS) (Table 3).
Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is the preferred echocardiography modality for the assessment of LVEF and cardiac

volumes. [54][,][75][–][79] If 3D echocardiography is not feasible (e.g. unavailable or poor tracking), the modified two-dimensional (2D)
Simpson’s biplane method is recommended. [80][,][81] In patients with inadequate TTE image quality, ultrasound-enhancing contrast agents
should be added to improve evaluation of LV function and volumes
if two or more LV segments are not well visualized. [82] Alternatively, in
subjects with poor-quality echocardiography windows, when available, CMR should be considered (Figure 8). [14][,][72][,][83][,][84] If TTE and
CMR are both unavailable for the assessment of LVEF, multigated acquisition nuclear imaging (MUGA) can be considered as a third-line
modality. MUGA scans should be avoided whenever possible due
to radiation exposure and the inability to obtain other important information (e.g. VHD, PAP, or GLS).
Baseline LVEF and GLS are recommended in all patients evaluated
with TTE before cardiotoxic cancer treatment initiation to stratify
CTR-CVT risk and to identify significant changes during treatment. [8][,][64] Changes in loading conditions occur frequently during
chemotherapy (e.g. volume increase due to intravenous [i.v.] fluids,
volume loss due to vomiting or diarrhoea, blood pressure [BP] and
heart rate changes with pain or stress) and may affect cardiac volumes, LVEF, and GLS quantification. Systemic arterial BP measurement is recommended with all resting TTE as it can influence

cardiac function measurements and should be recorded on the

TTE report. A baseline borderline (50–54%) or reduced (,50%)

LVEF is a risk factor for future CTR-CVT from most cardiotoxic cancer therapies, in particular with anthracyclines or trastuzumab. [12][,][24][,][74]

Increased baseline indexed LV end-diastolic volume can be a predictor of major CV events (symptomatic HF or cardiac death) during anthracycline chemotherapy in patients with preserved LVEF. [85]

A normal LVEF does not exclude CTRCD and deformation parameters can detect early systolic impairment with sufficient test reliability. [86][–][89] Determination of GLS using speckle tracking is
recommended at baseline, using three apical views, [90] particularly
in moderate- and high-risk patients. Baseline GLS can predict
LVD [89][–][94] in patients receiving anthracyclines and/or trastuzumab.
Strain measurements may be subject to inter-vendor variability [95]

and serial GLS measurement for each patient is recommended to
be performed using the same machine/software. A median GLS
change of 13.6% predicted a future fall in LVEF with a 95% upper limit
of GLS reduction of 15%. [93] Using the 15% cut-off improves specificity and is therefore the threshold recommended when monitoring
GLS during cancer therapy. Global circumferential strain [96] has been
reported to identify patients at risk of CTRCD, but data are currently
insufficient to recommend its use routinely. Baseline LV diastolic
function may be associated with a small risk of subsequent systolic
dysfunction, especially with anthracyclines and trastuzumab, although the evidence is not consistent. [97][,][98] Chest computed tomography (CT) or CMR may be helpful for identifying subclinical CVD
such as coronary calcium or intracardiac masses on readily available
routine imaging performed for cancer staging. [99]

In the secondary prevention setting or patients with symptoms or
signs of pre-existing CVD, a careful evaluation should begin with a
comprehensive TTE. [73] This is both to obtain baseline assessment
as in the primary prevention setting and to determine the severity
of the underlying CVD. In case of poor-quality or uninterpretable
TTE images, or if a specific CVD is identified (e.g. hypertrophic

and Section 5.5.5).

4.6. Cardiopulmonary fitness assessment
Maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) assesses the integrative capacity of the CV system to transport oxygen and energy
substrate to skeletal muscle during exercise, [109] described as cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). CPET can therefore provide a more global
assessment of CV health than organ-specific tools. CPET-derived


cardiomyopathy), CMR should be considered for further risk

assessment.

Functional imaging tests for myocardial ischaemia including
stress echocardiography, perfusion CMR, or nuclear myocardial per

fusion imaging should be performed to assess for ischaemia in
symptomatic patients (stable angina, limiting dyspnoea) if clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease (CAD) exists, especially prior to
use of cancer therapies associated with vascular toxicity (e.g. fluoro
–
pyrimidines, VEGFi, breakpoint cluster region Abelson oncogene locus [BCR-ABL], tyrosine kinase inhibitors [TKI]). Alternatively, in
patients with low to intermediate pre-test probability of CAD,
CCTA is a robust alternate modality with high sensitivity to rule
out obstructive CAD. [100][,][101]

Recommendation Table 4 — Recommendations for
cardiac imaging modalities in patients with cancer

CRF—typically measured as the peak rate of oxygen consumption [110][,][111] or metabolic equivalents [111][,][112] during exercise—is one
of the most robust predictors of CV health and longevity, [113][,][114]

and improves risk classification. [115][–][121] Evidence for CPET pretreatment is limited to pre-operative risk stratification particularly
for patients with lung, [122] colon, [123] and rectal [124] cancers. Whether
CPET performed prior to cardiotoxic cancer therapies is prognostic

of future CV events is unknown.

4.7. Cardiovascular risk evaluation
before cancer surgery
Cancer surgery remains the primary treatment modality for many
cancers. Cardio-oncology teams should be involved in pre-operative
CV risk stratification to identify and provide appropriate management and surveillance of the potential risk factors. [5]

In patients undergoing oncological surgery, peri-operative cardiac complications are determined by patient-related risk factors,
the tumour type, concomitant cancer therapies, and the expected
surgical risk. To ensure safe cancer surgery, consultations should
be directed at: (1) patients with previous significant or symptomatic CVD; (2) patients at high and very high CV toxicity risk, according to baseline HFA-ICOS risk assessment tools, [12] when
adjuvant (post-surgery) cancer treatment is planned; and (3) patients who have received neoadjuvant (prior to surgery) cancer
therapy that is potentially cardiotoxic. Pre-operative clinical evaluation should not delay surgery. Complementary tests required for
the patients included in groups 1 and 2 should be guided by general
ESC Guidelines. [125] However, in group 3 patients, the preoperative evaluation should be aimed at confirming that no relevant events have occurred during CV monitoring (Section 5).
Table 6 summarizes factors that could influence peri-operative
risk during cancer surgery.

4.8. Genetic testing
Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have resulted in the identification of 40 candidate genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with anthracycline-related cardiac


dysfunction. [37][,][126][–][128] It should be noted that with the advent of
immunotherapies, germline genes may not be the only genetic predispositions to CTR-CVT. A study of patients with ICI-associated
myocarditis identified that the selective clonal T-cell populations
infiltrating the myocardium were identical to those present in tumours and skeletal muscle, with ribonucleic acid sequencing studies revealing expression of cardiac-specific genes in the tumour, [129]

raising the intriguing possibility that somatic mutations in the tumour itself could contribute to CTR-CVT. A list of genetic variants
associated with CVD during cancer therapy is provided
[(Supplementary data, Table S9) and has recently been reviewed.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data) [38]

Routine use of genetic testing for the assessment of CTR-CVT risk
prior to initiation of cancer therapy is not currently recommended.
In the future, a personalized genetic approach may help define individual susceptibility to CVD in patients with cancer and more research is required.
#### 5. Prevention and monitoring of cardiovascular complications during cancer therapy

5.1. General principles
CTR-CVT risk may vary according to cancer type and stage, anticancer drugs, doses, and underlying comorbidities. Certain therapy

– –
combinations (drug drug or drug radiation) may have a synergistically toxic effect on the heart, possibly depending on the timing
of these therapies (sequential or concomitant) and previous comorbidities. The pathophysiology of CTR-CVT is out of the scope
of this guideline and is extensively reviewed in the ESC
CardioMed textbook. [130]

CVD and cancer share common modifiable and non-modifiable
risk factors (Figure 3). [4][,][131][,][132] The first step is to optimize lifestyle
CVRF, smoking cessation, restricting alcohol consumption to a maximum of 100 g per week, and maintaining adequate physical activity. [30] Exercise prescription seems to be a promising treatment to

counteract anticancer treatment side effects and different types of
training can be prescribed during cancer therapy according to a patient’s individual characteristics. [133] A healthy lifestyle decreases the
risks of cancer, CVD, and transition from diagnosed cancer to subsequent CVD. [134][,][135]


Poor CRF is associated with a higher prevalence of acute and
chronic CTR-CVT and exercise positively impacts CRF during
chemotherapy, although in a recent meta-analysis, the ability of exercise to prevent CTRCD is unclear. [136][,][137] CVRF must be corrected
with intensive treatment of arterial hypertension, [138] DM, [139] and

dyslipidaemia, [140] and underlying CVD and modifiable comorbidities
should be managed according to appropriate 2021 ESC Guidelines
on CVD prevention in clinical practice (Figure 9). [19]

Special attention should also be paid to the polypharmacy frequently seen in patients with cancer, reducing the use of drugs
that may interfere with cancer therapies to the essential and ac
–
tively monitoring their CV side effects and drug drug interactions. [141] Electrolyte imbalances such as hypokalaemia and
hypomagnesaemia should be corrected. The CV risk management
plan should be shared with the cancer specialist team, the primary care physician, and the patient to coordinate treatment

strategies.

5.2. Primary prevention strategies
Primary prevention of CTR-CVT aims to avoid or minimize the development of CV damage due to therapy in patients without
CVD [12][,][142] and requires a multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion
between oncologists and cardiologists for complex patients with
cancer with multiple comorbidities. [4][,][21][,][22][,][43][,][143][,][144]

5.2.1. Primary prevention of cancer
therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity during
anthracycline chemotherapy
Neurohormonal therapies during anthracycline chemotherapy (with
or without subsequent trastuzumab treatment) reduced the risk of
significant LVEF decline during follow-up in several small randomized
[controlled trials (RCTs) (Supplementary data, Table S10).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data) [145][–][154]

Recent meta-analyses including patients with cancer treated with anthracycline chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapies reported
that renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers,
and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have a significant benefit
in preventing LVEF reduction, but no statistical differences in the in
cidence of overt HF or other clinical outcomes were demonstrated
[(Supplementary data, Table S11).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data) [155][–][160] This may be due, in part, to
the fact that most trials included patients with a low baseline CTRCD
risk and therefore larger RCTs are needed in high-risk populations.
From the oncological perspective, some strategies that have been
investigated include managing anthracycline-related toxicity by adjusting the infusion time and dose intensity. [161] Dexrazoxane and liposomal anthracyclines are currently approved in patients with high and
very high CTRCD risk or who have already received high cumulative
anthracyclines doses. [158][,][162][–][167] Dexrazoxane is protective against
anthracycline-induced CTRCD. Currently, dexrazoxane is formally
approved in adult patients with advanced or metastatic BC who
have already received a minimum cumulative anthracycline dose of
300 mg/m [2] [of doxorubicin or equivalent (Table 5; Supplementary](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data)
[data, Table S12).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data) [163] In clinical practice, dexrazoxane infusion (dosage
ratio dexrazoxane/doxorubicin is 10/1; e.g. 500 mg/m [2] dexrazoxane
per 50 mg/m [2] doxorubicin) should be considered (at least 30 min
prior to each anthracycline cycle) in adult patients with cancer scheduled to receive a high total cumulative anthracycline dose for curative
treatment, and in patients with high and very high CTRCD risk (including those with pre-existing HF or low-normal or reduced
LVEF) where anthracycline chemotherapy is deemed essential. [163]


Pegylated and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [164][,][165][,][168]

modify pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution without compromising antitumour efficacy. Pegylated and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin are approved for metastatic BC and pegylated
liposomal doxorubicin is also approved for advanced ovarian cancer, acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related Kaposi sarcoma, and MM. In a recent meta-analysis of 19 trials, in both the
adjuvant and metastatic context, liposomal doxorubicin was reported to be less cardiotoxic than conventional doxorubicin. [165]

Liposomal daunorubicin is also available for acute leukaemia patients in place of daunorubicin when pre-existing LVD is
present. [164][,][165]

5.2.2. Primary prevention of radiation-induced
cardiovascular toxicity
Primary prevention of RT-induced damage to the CV system depends on technological advances that allow improved targeting of
RT delivery, thereby maintaining or increasing oncological efficacy
while reducing CTR-CVT. [169][,][170] Modern techniques strive to
minimize the mean heart dose (MHD), either by shaping the
dose distribution (intensity-modulated RT) or by using respiratory management (gating or breath-hold). [171][,][172] Proton therapy
offers the potential to further decrease exposure to surrounding
healthy organs. [173] However, complete cardiac avoidance is not
always possible due to the proximity of the tumour (e.g. central
lung tumours, mediastinal lymphomas, irradiation of the internal
mammary chain in BC). In patients where RT only has a consolidating role and the risk of RT-induced CV injury is very high (e.g.
due to baseline risk factors), a MDT is needed to consider the
risk/benefit of RT. [171][,][174]

There are no proven medical therapies to prevent RT-induced CV
toxicity. One component of RT-induced CV toxicity is accelerating
pre-existing CAD, and therefore tight control of CVRFs is

recommended.

5.3. Secondary prevention strategies
Secondary prevention refers to interventions in patients with preexisting CVD, including prior CTR-CVT, and new emerging
CTR-CVT during cancer therapy. CVD and comorbidities should receive the optimal therapy before and during cancer therapy as discussed in previous sections. Regular clinical assessments, physical
examinations, and CV investigations (including 12-lead ECG, TTE,
and cardiac biomarkers) are recommended in patients receiving specific cardiotoxic cancer therapies, with the frequency of surveillance
guided by baseline risk and the emergence of new
CTR-CVT. [5][,][12][,][33][,][53][,][54][,][187][–][190]

Recommendation Table 6 — Recommendation for
secondary prevention of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity


5.4. Cardiovascular surveillance during
cancer therapies
A careful clinical evaluation and physical examination is recommended during cancer treatment to detect early signs and symptoms
of CTR-CVT. ECG monitoring is required in patients at risk of cardiac arrhythmias according to specific drug protocols.

5.4.1. Cardiac serum biomarkers

During therapy, NP and cTn should be used for CTRCD screening
and diagnosis and they may also serve to guide therapy. [55][,][63][,][191][–][194]

The release of cTn and NP differ for different cancer treatments.

Therefore, an increase in biomarker level should be interpreted in
the patient clinical context (cancer treatment timing and
comorbidities).
It is important to consider that generally accepted cut-offs and reference values of CV biomarkers have not been established for patients with cancer or for those who receive cancer therapies. In
addition, levels of NP and cTn may differ according to local laboratories and may be altered by many factors, including age, sex, renal
function, obesity, infections, and comorbidities such as AF and
pulmonary embolism (PE). [53][,][63][,][195][–][197]

5.4.2. Cardiac imaging
Cardiac imaging plays a critical role in clinical decision-making during

—
the cancer process. [72][,][198] Imaging techniques particularly advanced

—
echocardiography and CMR facilitate early diagnosis and management of CTR-CVT. [22][,][54][,][94] The frequency of cardiac imaging monitoring during therapy should be adapted according to the estimated
baseline risk [12] and the expected CTR-CVT manifestation. [54] The cardiac imaging technique used should be based on local expertise and
availability, and the same imaging modality (i.e. 3D-TTE, 2D-TTE,
CMR) is recommended throughout the entire treatment to decrease
inter-technique variability. [94][,][199][,][200] Cardiac imaging should be performed at any time if patients receiving cardiotoxic therapies present
with new cardiac symptoms.
New definitions of CTRCD are presented in Section 3. [1] Early
recognition of asymptomatic CTRCD allows clinicians to incorporate cardioprotective therapy before there is a significant decline
in LVEF, which may or may not be reversible, and also decreases
the risk of interruptions in cancer therapy, which could otherwise
affect patients’ survival. [22][,][43][,][72][,][94] For the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic CTRCD during cancer treatment, TTE—in
—
cluding 3D-LVEF and GLS assessment is the preferred technique
to detect and confirm cardiac dysfunction. [72][,][83][,][93][,][102] GLS evaluation is particularly important in patients with low-normal LVEF
to confirm or not asymptomatic myocardial damage. [201] It is recommended to use the same vendor to analyse GLS during cancer
treatment to accurately compare values over time. [73] Therefore, a
relative change in GLS has been suggested as the ideal tool to identify asymptomatic mild CTRCD. [1][,][4][,][94] Different thresholds have
been considered in the literature in recent years. [93][,][202][,][203]

Currently, a relative GLS decrease of .15% compared with baseline is the recommended threshold as it reflects the 95% upper

5.5. Cancer therapy-related
cardiovascular toxicity monitoring
protocols
5.5.1. Anthracycline chemotherapy
Anthracycline-induced CTRCD is a dose-dependent and cumulative
process of variable onset that may present with symptomatic or
asymptomatic CTRCD. [4]

Figure 10 summarizes the recommended monitoring protocol
during anthracycline therapy according to baseline CTRCD risk
(Table 4). Clinical assessment combined with cardiac biomarkers
(cTn and NP) and TTE (including 3D-LVEF and GLS when available) can identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic CTRCD
with a reasonably high negative predictive value. This topic has
been extensively reviewed in two recent HFA position
statements. [53][,][54] Classifying patients based on their risk of
anthracycline-induced CV toxicity has allowed the early implementation of personalized preventive strategies (Section 5.2.1). [14]

Patients with pre-existing CVD should be treated with guidelinebased medical therapy. [14][,][19][,][207]

5.5.2. HER2-targeted therapies
HER2-targeted therapies are a crucial part of the treatment of
patients with HER2-positive invasive BC in both early and metastatic settings. In the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant settings, drugs
currently approved are trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab
emtansine, and neratinib. In the metastatic setting, trastuzumab,
pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine, tucatinib, and trastuzumab
deruxtecan are currently approved. [214][–][216] Trastuzumab can
also be used in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic
gastric adenocarcinomas in combination with platinum-based
chemotherapy and either capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
It is recognized that anti-HER2 therapies may lead to LVD in

–
up to 15 20% of patients and to overt HF if surveillance is
missed, or in high- and very high-risk patients. [217][–][220] LV function
surveillance based on LVEF and GLS is recommended prior to
and every 3 months during HER2-targeted therapies treatment
surveillance (Figure 11). [22] However, this single algorithm has
not been tested in low- or high-risk patients and increased frequency of assessment (according to local availability) is recommended in high-risk patients.
The use of cardiac serum biomarkers to identify CTRCD is
less well-defined during anti-HER2 treatments. [217] Measurement
of cTn in BC patients after anthracycline-based chemotherapy
but prior to trastuzumab should be considered, as an elevated
cTn identifies patients at higher risk of trastuzumab-induced

CTRCD. Serial NP measurement was more sensitive than cTn

at predicting subsequent declines in LVEF during trastuzumab
treatment. [74]

This protocol refers to CV toxicity monitoring in patients receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant anti-HER2 targeted therapies for non-metastatic disease or first year in metastatic disease. Biomarker assessment should ideally be performed before the
corresponding trastuzumab cycle. TTE should be performed in week 2 or 3 of a 3-weekly trastuzumab cycle. [a] In low-risk HER2+ EBC patients who
are asymptomatic and with a normal assessment after 3 months, reducing TTE monitoring to every 4 months may be considered (Class IIb, Level C).
In low- and moderate-risk metastatic HER2+ disease, TTE surveillance can be reduced to every 6 months after the first year in asymptomatic patients
with normal TTE assessment (Class I, Level C). [b] In high- and very high-risk metastatic HER2+ disease, TTE monitoring every 2–3 cycles may be considered
depending on the absolute risk and local availability. [c] Cardiac magnetic resonance should be considered for the assessment of cardiac function when TTE
is unavailable or not diagnostic. [d] Measurement of NP and/or cTn is recommended in all patients with cancer if these biomarkers are going to be used
during treatment monitoring. [e] Baseline cTn measurement should be considered in low- and moderate-risk patients after anthracycline chemotherapy
but prior to starting anti-HER2 targeted therapies for CV toxicity risk prediction.


For patients requiring adjuvant chemotherapy and
anti-HER2-targeted therapy, the use of non-anthracycline chemo
therapy should be considered by the MDT according to

risk of relapse, cardiac risks, and in discussion with the
treating oncologist. [217] When anthracycline chemotherapy in the

(neo)-adjuvant setting is necessary, sequential use (anthracyclines

followed by taxanes and anti-HER2 agents) has been shown
to significantly decrease the incidence of CTRCD in several

adjuvant trials, compared with concomitant use in earlier
trials. [220][–][224]


Baseline echocardiography [c] is recommended I B

is up to 10%. [232] Among the several mechanisms responsible for
5-FU-induced myocardial ischaemia are coronary vasospasm and
endothelial injury. [233] Chest pain and ischaemic ECG changes usually
occur at rest (less typically during exercise) within days of drug administration and sometimes persist even after treatment cessation.
CTR-CVT risk markedly increases in patients with cancer with preexisting CAD. Aggressive control of modifiable CVRFs, according to
the 2021 ESC Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice, [19] is
recommended during and after treatment. A baseline TTE is
recommended in patients with a history of symptomatic CV to
confirm the presence of pre-existing regional wall motion
abnormalities or LVD. Screening for CAD may be considered in
selected high- and very high-risk patients before the administration
of these drugs and according to local protocols and current
recommendations. [12][,][234][,][235]

ischaemia-related ECG abnormalities, hypertension, Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), and MI (even in patients with normal coronary arteries), [1][,][4][,][10][,][43][,][229][,][230] with rarer CTR-CVT including myocarditis,

5.5.4. Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors
Aberrant activation of kinases plays a critical role in both the development of numerous cancer types and in CV and metabolic homeostasis. Inhibition of the VEGF signalling pathway is achieved with
either monoclonal antibodies (administered i.v.) against circulating
VEGF or with small-molecule TKI (taken orally) targeting VEGF receptors. [236] VEGFi are used for the treatment of numerous cancer
types, including renal, thyroid, and hepatocellular carcinomas.
However, their use is associated with a wide array of CV complications including hypertension, HF, QTc prolongation, and acute vascular events (Figure 12). [131][,][237][–][240] It can be challenging to assess the
prognosis of patients experiencing severe CV side effects because

these drugs are often used in patients with advanced cancer. The goal
must be to continue VEGFi treatment for as long as possible with initiation or optimization of CV treatment if indicated.
Hypertension is a class effect and is the most reported adverse
event under VEGFi treatment. It occurs within hours or days, is dosedependent, and is usually reversed by VEGFi discontinuation. [131][,][239][,][241][–][243] The risk is higher in patients with pre-existing
hypertension or CVD, previous anthracycline treatment, advanced
age, history of smoking, hyperlipidaemia, and/or obesity (Table 4). [4][,][244]


LVD and HF occur in a minority of patients in RCTs, [245] but are reported more frequently in routine practice [246] and are often reversible. [247] Acute arterial events (aortic dissection, stroke, arterial
thrombosis, acute coronary events, vasospasm) and venous
thromboembolism (VTE) can also complicate treatment with
VEGFi. [248] QTc prolongation has been described with sunitinib, sorafenib, and vandetanib, [249] but it is rarely related to severe arrhythmic
events, except with vandetanib. [250] Some small-molecule TKI (e.g.
sorafenib and sunitinib) can cause AF [251] and HF. [43][,][129][,][247]

ESC Guidelines 4263


A baseline CV risk assessment includes clinical examination, BP

measurement, and an ECG with baseline QTcF measurement (see
Section 4). [20] Especially in patients with known hypertension, BP
should be controlled before VEGFi therapy. A baseline TTE is


recommended for high- and very high-risk patients. [14] Patients with
impaired LV function and/or patients at high or very high risk of developing HF should be referred to the cardiologist before starting
VEGFi therapy. [14]

dose increase (see Section 6.4.2). [b] Cardiac magnetic resonance should be considered for the assessment of cardiac function when TTE is unavailable or not
diagnostic. [c] Measurement of NP is recommended in all patients with cancer if these biomarkers are going to be used during treatment monitoring. [d] TTE
and NP should be considered at 4 weeks after starting treatment in very high-risk patients.

4264 ESC Guidelines


Monitoring during and after treatment is indicated for all patients
treated with a VEGFi and is based on close clinical follow-up using
serial ECGs, biomarkers, and echocardiography. Early recognition
and treatment of hypertension are essential to prevent other CV
complications, especially HF. Home BP monitoring is recommended
daily during the first cycle, after each increase of anticancer therapy
dose, and every 2–3 weeks thereafter. [138][,][254][,][255] When treatment
with a VEGFi is stopped, a drop in BP must be anticipated and
BP-lowering therapy must be reduced and/or interrupted accordingly (Section 6).
In patients at risk of QTc prolongation, regular monitoring of the
QTc interval is recommended after a dose increase, whenever other

QT-prolonging agents are added, or if electrolyte imbalances occur
(Section 6).
Patients treated with a VEGFi must also be screened regularly for symptoms and clinical signs of HF. Regular NP measurement and echocardiography can be useful for the
detection of CTRCD, although evidence is weak
(Figure 13). [138][,][254][,][255]

5.5.5. Multitargeted kinase inhibitors targeting
BCR-ABL

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) results from aberrant acti

—
Small-molecule TKIs targeting BCR-ABL including imatinib,

—
bosutinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib have proven ef
fective in the treatment of CML. The toxicities associated

with these TKIs are unique and due to ‘off-target’ effects of
each drug. Dasatinib is associated with group 1 pulmonary
hypertension (PH), HF, and pleural and pericardial effusion,
whereas nilotinib and ponatinib are generally associated
with vascular events (Figure 14). [131][,][256][–][259] Secondgeneration BCR-ABL TKI may induce a QTc prolongation
(see Section 6.4.2). CV toxicity risk is higher in patients
aged .65 years (relative risk 1.8) and in those with underlying DM (relative risk 2.5), hypertension (relative risk 3.2) or
pre-existing CAD (relative risk 2.6). [256][–][258][,][260] Before
BCR-ABL TKI therapy, it is critical to define baseline CV toxicity risk with special attention to BP, glucose, and lipids.

Baseline ECG is recommended in all patients and QTc monitoring in patients treated with second-generation BCR-ABL
TKI. Depending on the type of therapy used, specific CV assessments should be performed after drug initiation

oral inhibitor of BTK, has proven highly effective in chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia and related B-cell malignancies including
mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and marginal zone lymphomas. [262] These disorders are usually diagnosed in
elderly patients in whom frequent comorbidities coexist at diagnosis that increase the risk of CTR-CVT. [263][,][264] Ibrutinib has been as
sociated with bleeding diathesis, infections, and an increased risk of
hypertension, AF, and HF. [265][–][267] Ibrutinib may also cause ventricular
arrhythmias without prolonging QT. [267][,][268] Acalabrutinib is a secondgeneration BTK inhibitor with greater BTK selectivity. In a recent
phase III, randomized, multicentre, open-label, non-inferiority study,
acalabrutinib demonstrated a non-inferior progression-free survival
compared to ibrutinib in patients with previously treated chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia with a lower incidence of symptomatic CV
events. [269] However, grade ≥3 AF (symptomatic AF where urgent
intervention is indicated) [270] and AF in patients ≥75 years old or with
previous AF history were comparable between groups, as was the
risk of CV events in patients with pre-existing CVRFs or CVD. [271]

Therefore, we currently do not have enough data to establish different
monitoring strategies in patients treated with these drugs.
Due to the lack of evidence-based recommendations, the management of these CV events is challenging. [264] Antihypertensive initiation
has been associated with a lower risk of a major adverse CV events
(MACE). [264] Opportunistic screening for AF by pulse-taking or ECG
rhythm strip is recommended at every clinical visit during BTK inhibitor therapy. [272]

Due to a higher bleeding risk, ibrutinib should be temporarily
interrupted in patients requiring dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)
and 3–7 days before invasive procedures. In case of emergency interventions, platelet transfusion should be considered to minimize
bleeding risks. [262]

5.5.7. Multiple myeloma therapies
There are many classes of pharmacotherapy that are approved for
the treatment of MM using a range of combinations. These include
immunomodulatory drugs (IMiD), dexamethasone, PI, and monoclonal antibodies (e.g. daratumumab). PI—including bortezomib, carfil
—
zomib, and ixazomib have become a mainstay of therapy for
newly diagnosed MM as well as relapsed disease. [276][,][277] Several large
studies using combination therapy for MM have demonstrated an increased risk of serious CV adverse events. [278][–][281] MM patients being
treated with PI have a high incidence of coexistent CV comorbidities

and increased baseline CV risk. [282][,][283] PI have been associated with a
variety of CV toxicities including hypertension, HF, [284] acute coronary syndromes (ACS), [66] arrhythmias, [285] PH, [286] and VTE
(Figure 16). [287][,][288] During therapy, cardiac biomarkers and TTE are
important diagnostic and prognostic tools that can inform clinical
decision-making (Figure 17). [66]

HF—especially HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)—is a
frequent manifestation of cardiac amyloidosis, but it is also an important adverse effect of PI therapy, especially under carfilzomib.


In a safety analysis of patients with MM being treated with carfilzomib, 7.2% of patients were found to have new HF. [284] In another
study, 23% of patients with MM treated with carfilzomib developed
clinical HF and/or LVD. [289] The mechanism is not well understood

but is possibly related to PI-induced oxidative stress within myocytes,
inhibition of the proteasome, or transient endothelial dysfunction. [281][,][283] Although no studies have yet addressed the optimal
follow-up scheme in patients with MM treated with PI, a common
scheme consists of 3–6-monthly visits with ECG, complete blood

tests (including NP and cTn) and echocardiography surveillance during PI therapy. [290] A recent prospective study of patients with relapsed MM confirmed the utility of NP to assist in risk stratification
as well as management of CV morbidity during treatment. [66]

Hypertension, another adverse effect of PI, may also contribute to
the development of HFpEF.

Patients with MM are at elevated risk of thrombosis due to both

patient- and myeloma-related factors, particularly the combination of PI and IMiD (Figure 18). [279][,][287][,][291][–][297] In the ASPIRE
(Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone vs.

Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the Treatment of

Patients with Relapsed Multiple Myeloma) study, patients treated


with a combination of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone had higher rates of VTE compared with those treated with
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (6.6% vs. 3.9%). [279]

Oncological guidelines recommend the use of aspirin or prophylactic doses of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) in lowrisk patients receiving thalidomide- or lenalidomide-based regimens. [298] In patients at high risk of VTE, therapeutic doses of
LMWH are recommended. [299] The role of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in MM patients needs further validation in larger trials, but recent small studies have confirmed the
efficacy and safety of low doses of apixaban and rivaroxaban for
VTE prevention. [300][–][302]

5.5.8. Rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma and
mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated
kinase inhibitor treatment

—
The rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) inhibitors vemurafenib,

—
dabrafenib, and encorafenib are approved for the treatment of
metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. The mitogen
—
activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitors

trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib, and selumetinib—have also
shown significant clinical activity in melanoma patients whose tumour contains a BRAF V600 mutation, and are now largely used

in combination with RAF inhibitors. The main CV effects to be con
sidered are hypertension, PE, and CTRCD, which are associated
with all combinations of RAF and MEK inhibitors, and QTc prolongation, associated solely with the coadministration of cobimetinib and vemurafenib (Figure 19). [12][,][308][,][309] RAF inhibitor treatment

alone or in combination with a MEK inhibitor is associated with an
increased risk of MI and AF. [308]

Patients with cancer with pre-existing CVD have an increased
frequency of CV adverse events during treatment with MEK
and RAF inhibitors, and therefore baseline risk stratification is
recommended. [12] Most cardiac complications induced by admin
istration of MEK and RAF inhibitors seem to be attributable to

the MEK inhibitor, with the RAF inhibitor enhancing the toxic
effects of the MEK inhibitor. [310][–][313] Hypertension and LVD
were twice as frequent when MEK and RAF inhibitors were
coadministered compared with single therapy with RAF inhibitor
alone. [314]

CTRCD can manifest any time from the first month of therapy to 2 years after the end of the oncological treatment. [315]

Baseline TTE is recommended in patients at moderate to high
risk of CTR-CVT. During treatment, it is necessary to monitor
BP at each visit and promote weekly outpatient monitoring during the first 3 months and monthly thereafter. In patients treated

with cobimetinib/vemurafenib, an ECG is recommended at 2

and 4 weeks after initiation of treatment and every 3 months
thereafter. In high-risk patients, periodic monitoring of ventricular function with echocardiography should be considered
every 6–12 months.

with MEK and RAF inhibitors but, from a mechanistic perspective,
beta-blockers might prevent CTRCD induced by MEK inhibitors.
The MEK/ERK pathway has a cardiac protective effect, regulated


by beta-adrenergic signalling, which also controls the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases pathway, associated with cardiotoxic
effects. Beta-blockers might exert their cardioprotective effects
by reducing p38 signalling. [315]

5.5.9. Immune checkpoint inhibitors
Immunotherapies, which harness the immune system to destroy cancer cells, come in different forms but the most widely
used are ICI. [316] The immune checkpoints are proteins expressed in the T cells that inhibit their activation when they
contact a body cell. ICI include monoclonal antibodies that
block the immune brakes or regulators, cytotoxic T
lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) (ipilimumab,


tremelimumab), programmed death-1 (PD-1) (nivolumab, cemiplimab, pembrolizumab), and programmed death-ligand 1
(PD-L1) (atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab) expressed in
the cancer cells, with the consequent cytotoxic immune response. By blocking these checkpoints from binding with their
partner proteins, ICI inhibit the ‘off’ signal, activating T cells
and promoting killing of cancer cells. Although their pathophysiology is not clearly defined, ICI may also trigger an

overactivation of T cells against non-cancerous tissues, leading
to immune-related adverse events. [317] Immune-related CV side

effects may lead to life-threatening CV complications such as
fulminant myocarditis, myopericarditis, cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, or MI, which often results in the discontinuation of
ICI. [318][,][319]

The largest case series of 122 patients with ICI-associated
myocarditis had early onset of symptoms (median of 30 days
after initial exposure to ICI), and up to 50% died. [320] Late CV
events (.90 days) are less well characterized but generally exhibit a higher risk of non-inflammatory HF, progressive atherosclerosis, hypertension, and mortality rates. [321] Other CV
toxicities described during ICI therapy are MI, AV block, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, sudden death,
Takotsubo-like syndrome, non-inflammatory HF, hypercholesterolaemia, pericarditis, pericardial effusion, ischaemic stroke,
and VTE. [322] A meta-analysis including 32 518 patients receiving
ICI treatment reported an increased risk of myocarditis, pericardial diseases, HF, dyslipidaemia, MI, and cerebral arterial ischaemia. [323] Conditions related with high baseline ICI-related
CV toxicity risk include dual ICI therapy (e.g. ipilimumab and nivolumab), combination ICI therapy with other cardiotoxic therapies, and patients with ICI-related non-CV events or prior
CTRCD or CVD (Figure 20). [324][,][325] All patients on ICI treatment should have an ECG and troponin assay at baseline
(Figure 20). [326][–][329] High-risk patients should additionally have a

TTE evaluation at baseline. Due to the lack of evidence-based

recommendations, the monitoring of ICI therapy is challenging.
Once started on therapy, ECG, cTn, and NP should be
checked. [330][–][332] In the JAVELIN trial, which assessed avelumab
plus axitinib vs. sunitinib, no clinical value was observed for ontreatment routine TTE monitoring in asymptomatic patients. [333]

However, in high-risk patients, and in those with high baseline
cTn levels, TTE monitoring may be considered. In patients
who develop ECG abnormalities, new biomarker changes, or
new cardiac symptoms at any time, prompt cardio-oncology
evaluation is strongly recommended, including TTE for the
evaluation of LVEF and GLS, and CMR when myocarditis is suspected (Table 3). [334]

5.5.10. Androgen deprivation therapies for
prostate cancer
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is prescribed in 40% of men
with prostate cancer as neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy to
RT or for biochemical relapse following prostate cancer surgery.
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are the most frequently prescribed ADT. However, GnRH agonists are associated
with an increased CV risk and mortality, particularly in patients
with prostate cancer aged .60 years. [337][,][338] Baseline risk stratification in patients requiring GnRH agonists depends on vascular disease
risk (Figure 21). [339][,][340] No dedicated CV toxicity risk calculators have
been developed for patients receiving ADT. It was the consensus of
the authors to recommend SCORE2 or SCORE2-OP to stratify CV
risk in patients receiving ADT without previous CVD. [19]

The use of GnRH antagonists represents an alternative in the
treatment of prostate cancer, and preclinical and clinical (HERO
trial) [341] data suggest that GnRH antagonist use is associated with significantly lower overall mortality and CV events compared with agonists. [342] However, more research is needed in this field. In the
PRONOUNCE trial, no difference in MACE at 1 year was observed
between degarelix (a GnRH antagonist) and leuprolide (a GnRH
agonist), although the trial was stopped early. [343] Lower CV event
rates were detected compared with previous studies and all patients
were reviewed by a cardiologist at enrolment (leading to optimal
CVRF management). [343]

The main CV effects to be considered are hypertension, DM, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and CTRCD. [339][,][344] ADT is uncommonly associated with QTc prolongation and rarely causes torsade de pointes
(TdP) through blockade of testosterone effects on ventricular repolarization. [345][,][346] ECG monitoring and correction of QT prolongation pre[cipitant factors (see Section 6.4.2; Table 9; Supplementary data,](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data)

5.5.11. Endocrine therapies for breast cancer

–
Endocrine therapy is a common treatment as 65 70% of all early
and metastatic BC patients develop hormone receptor-positive
disease. [22] Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen,
toremifene) or aromatase inhibitors (AI) (letrozole, anastrozole,
or exemestane) are recommended in early BC (EBC) according
to menopausal status, comorbidities, and the risk of disease relapse.
The use of AI in combination with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
4/6 inhibitors is recommended as first- or second-line therapy
in patient with hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative meta
static BC.

The use of AI increases the risk of dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, HF, and MI. [339] In the ATAC (‘Arimidex’ and
Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial, anastrozole-treated patients with pre-existing CAD experienced more CV events (17%
vs. 10%) and cholesterol level elevation (9% vs. 5%) than those treated with tamoxifen. [351][,][352] Similarly, HF was significantly more common with letrozole compared with tamoxifen in the BIG (Breast
International Group) 1–98 trial. [353] Longer AI treatment duration
was associated with increased odds of developing CVD in two large
meta-analyses. [354][,][355] Significantly increased VTE risk has been consistently demonstrated with tamoxifen [351][,][353] and it is not recommended in patients with thrombotic risks. Toremifene and


high-dose tamoxifen were found to prolong QTc interval [339][,][340] ;
however, no risk data have been published in patients treated with
the standard tamoxifen dose used in BC (20 mg/day).
The risks of VTE, hypercholesterolaemia, and CVD should be discussed with patients, while recognizing that the absolute benefits of
preventing BC recurrence usually outweigh the CV risks. [339] In patients,70 years old without clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic disease, estimation of 10-year fatal and non-fatal CVD risk with
SCORE2 (if ≥70 years, SCORE2-OP) is recommended. [19]

Cholesterol levels and BP should be monitored regularly in patients
receiving AI. [356] Physical activity and healthy diet are also advised to
reduce weight and cholesterol levels. Smoking cessation is strongly
recommended to reduce CV risk (e.g. CAD during AI therapy and
VTE during tamoxifen therapy).

5.5.12. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors
The use of CDK 4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) in combination with endocrine therapy is approved for the
treatment of patients with hormone receptor-positive/
HER2-negative metastatic BC. This combination has resulted in improvements in progression-free survival and, in some trials, overall
survival. [357][–][359] CDK 4/6 inhibitors have demonstrated a potential
for QT prolongation, [339][,][360] particularly with ribociclib. The phase
III trials of ribociclib incorporated routine ECG monitoring. [361][–][368]



ESC Guidelines 4277


Baseline ECG is recommended and ECGs should be repeated at day
14 of the first cycle, before the second cycle, with any dose increase
and as clinically indicated. [357]

In patients who already have, or are at significant risk of developing, QT prolongation (Section 6.4.2), the risks/benefits for ribociclib
should be discussed by a MDT. Importantly, the use of ribociclib
should be avoided in combination with drugs known to prolong
QT interval and/or strong CYP3A inhibitors. [357]

5.5.13. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors
Patients with cancer treated with anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) inhibitors may develop adverse CV events including sinus
bradycardia, AV block, QTc prolongation, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, and dyslipidaemia. [370][,][371] ACS and HF have rarely been described under crizotinib. [372] A baseline ECG is recommended in

patients prior to starting an ALK inhibitor, especially crizotinib,
and patients may have an ECG 4 weeks after the start of treatment

–
and every 3 6 months thereafter, particularly if the baseline ECG is
abnormal. Home BP monitoring should be considered in patients
treated with brigatinib or lorlatinib. Patients receiving lorlatinib or


crizotinib treatment should have cholesterol levels checked every

3–6 months and treated if elevated.

5.5.14. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors
Osimertinib is an oral irreversible, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)-TKI approved for patients with non-small cell lung cancer expressing EGFR mutations. Recent data have shown that osimertinib is
associated with an increased risk of QTc prolongation, AF, VTE, LVD,
and HF (Figure 22). [373][,][374] A study of 123 patients with EGFR-mutant
non-small cell lung cancer treated with osimertinib reported a 4.9%
incidence of HF or MI and a significant decrease in LVEF,53% in
11% of patients with TTE surveillance. [375] Pre-existing hypertension
and older age are risk factors for LVD and HF (3.9% and 2.6% incidence, respectively). [376] LVD and HF were more common during
the first year of therapy. [376]

Baseline CV risk stratification, ECG and TTE prior to starting osimertinib is recommended. Three-monthly echocardiographic surveillance for new LVD during osimertinib treatment should be
considered. Close monitoring of magnesium levels is also recommended to minimize the risk of osimertinib-induced hypomagnesaemia and QTc prolongation.

5.5.15. Chimeric antigen receptor
T cell and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes
therapies
CAR-T therapy is used for the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukaemia and aggressive B-cell lymphomas. [377] Although the reported
incidence is variable, there is a growing recognition of the association
between CAR-T therapy and CTR-CVT, including LVD, HF, cardiac
arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, TTS, and cardiac arrest. [378][–][383] The
majority of the described CV toxicities have been shown to be associated with the occurrence of cytokine release syndrome
(CRS). [377][,][384] Baseline CV evaluation including ECG, NP, and cTn is
recommended in all patients. Baseline TTE should also be considered, especially in patients with pre-existing CVRF and CVD. After
receiving CAR-T therapy, patients may develop systemic inflammatory syndromes. [385] CRS should be suspected when a patient develops fever, with or without tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension,
hypoxia, and/or other end-organ dysfunction hours to days after
treatment. [385] A high index of suspicion is necessary to diagnose


CRS and to distinguish it from other conditions that occur in these
settings (infections, HF, drug reactions, and PE). [378][,][386] Among adults,
there was a relationship between CRS and CV events. An elevation in
cTn is commonly seen in patients with CRS and is associated with an
increased risk for subsequent CV events. [378] In a recent retrospective
pharmacovigilance study, CAR-T was associated with tachyarrhythmias (AF the most common, followed by ventricular arrhythmias),
cardiomyopathy, and pleural and pericardial diseases. [379] Globally,
the fatality rate of CV and pulmonary adverse events was
30.9%. [378][,][379][,][387] Early cardiac evaluation in patients with cTn increase
should include NP, ECG, and echocardiography (see Section 6.1.4 for
management). [388]

Adoptive cellular therapy with TIL has emerged as an effective
treatment option for unresectable stage III/IV metastatic melanoma.
With TILs, the CV toxicity appears to be related to direct myocardial
and vascular toxicity. [380] Baseline assessment and CV surveillance in
patients before TIL therapies is the same pathway recommended
for CAR-T therapies.

5.5.16. Radiotherapy
RT increases the risk of developing subsequent CVD and peripheral artery disease (PAD). [173][,][389][–][394] There is ongoing debate regarding the safest radiation dose, which cardiac substructures
are most sensitive to RT-induced injury, and the most appropriate
strategies to minimize RT-related CVD. [395][,][396] The heart is considered a radiosensitive ‘organ at risk’ during RT and radiation exposure to the heart should be kept as low as reasonably achievable
because there is no ‘safe’ dose (Figure 23). [389][,][390] RT-induced CV
toxicity risk categorization based on MHD [389][,][397] is recommended
over categorization based on prescribed dose, which may not accurately reflect cardiac radiation exposure (e.g. 35 Gray [Gy] prescribed dose to approximately 70% of the heart is equivalent to
approximately 25 Gy MHD, whereas 35 Gy prescribed dose to approximately 40% of the heart is equivalent to approximately 15 Gy
MHD). However, MHD is not a perfect metric, and in some patients, a very small portion of the heart might be irradiated to a
very high dose, still conveying a substantial risk despite a low
MHD. [398] Therefore, depending on dose distribution and exposure
of specific cardiac substructures and CVRFs, the cancer treatment
team may judge the patient to belong to a higher-risk category. [397][,][399][–][401]

Strategies to prevent and attenuate CV complications of RT
have focused on reducing radiation exposure of the heart and
CV substructures during cancer treatment and include the
following.


(1) Modification of cancer management to omit RT. This emphasizes
the importance of integrating a personalized cardio-oncology
evaluation. [402][–][404]

(2) Modification of the dose and volume of RT treatments where
possible. RT protocols should target the minimum volume required to the minimum dose needed to obtain the desired clinical benefit.
(3) Modification of delivery techniques to reduce cardiac radiation
exposure should lead to a considerable reduction in risk.
Modern heart-sparing RT strategies include: the optimal use of
modern intensity-modulated photon RT technologies; the use
of deep inspiration breath-hold or respiratory-gated techniques
in BC, [405] lymphoma, [406] and lung cancer [407] ; or the use of imageguided RT to ensure accuracy of delivery and proton beam
therapy. [408]

The incidence of cardiac events following RT may vary according
to patient risk factors and synergistic effects of radiation with other
cardiotoxic cancer treatments. [12][,][173]

There are no known RT-specific secondary preventative measures (e.g. drug treatments) to reduce the risk of CV events following RT. However, given the known importance of
conventional CVRF on the incidence of RT-related events, optimization of modifiable CVRF is recommended in all patients

before and after RT.

HSCT constitutes a potentially curative therapeutic option for many
haematological malignancies. Improvements in HSCT techniques and
supportive strategies have markedly decreased treatment-related

recognition of HSCT-related CV toxicities and HSCT survivors constitute a population at high future CV risk. Several factors contribute
to define the risk of HSCT-related CV toxicities, including the HSCT

GVHD is associated with thrombosis and inflammatory myocardial
damage (myocarditis, HF, conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias,
and pericardial effusions), and chronic GVHD has been linked with
increasing risk of hypertension, DM, and dyslipidaemia. [415][,][416]

A comprehensive CV evaluation, including NP assessment, ECG,
and TTE, has become a core component of the pre-HSCT assessment [409][,][410] to detect undiagnosed CVD, stratify CTR-CVT risk,
and optimize pre-existing CV conditions. [411][,][417][–][420] In early surveillance, TTE monitoring is recommended in high-risk HSCT recipients
at 3 and 12 months as LVEF and GLS can decrease after transplant
(see Section 7). Independent factors associated with long-term CVD
in HSCT survivors are allogenic HSCT, pre-existing CVD or multiple
uncontrolled CVRF, cancer treatment history (mediastinal or mantle field radiation, alkylating agents, .250 mg/m [2] doxorubicin or
equivalent), high-risk conditioning schemes (total body irradiation,
alkylating agents), and GVHD. [410] Figure 24 summarizes strategies
for the prevention and attenuation of CV complications in patients
undergoing HSCT.

5.5.18. Other cancer treatments

Several other cancer therapies may also induce clinically relevant CV
events. Cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) can induce myocardial dysfunction and HF. [4]

Cyclophosphamide CV toxicity is primarily seen in patients receiving
high doses (.140 mg/kg) before HSCT and typically occurs within
days of drug administration. [410]

Platinum-containing chemotherapy (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin) may cause vascular disease (vasospasm, MI, and venous and
arterial thrombosis). These may occur during treatment and also
contribute to increased long-term risk of CAD in survivors.
Patients with testicular cancer treated with cisplatin have a higher
risk for vascular disease at long-term follow-up. [421] The risk of the individual patient is still hard to predict, but lifestyle interventions, a
high degree of clinical suspicion in patients who experience chest
pain, and close CVRF monitoring is recommended during and after
therapy. [422] Cisplatin [422] infrequently causes HF; however, because
it requires the administration of a high i.v. volume to avoid renal toxicity, patients with pre-existing CVD may develop symptomatic HF.
Arsenic trioxide is used to treat some leukaemias and myelomas.

–
Arsenic trioxide frequently prolongs the QT interval (26 93% of patients), and life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias have been
reported. [45][,][259] QTc prolongation was observed 1–5 weeks after arsenic trioxide infusion and then returned towards baseline by the end
of 8 weeks. Patients receiving treatment with arsenic trioxide should
be monitored weekly with ECG during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
Electrolyte monitoring is also required as arsenic trioxide may induce
hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, and renal dysfunction. Risk factors
for QT prolongation should be controlled before, during, and after
cancer treatment (Section 6.4.2).
Several FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors (first-generation:
midostaurin; second-generation: gilteritinib) have been tested for the
treatment of acute myeloid leukaemias. Gilterinib-induced differentiation syndrome (fever, dyspnoea, pleuropericardial effusion, pulmonary oedema, peripheral oedema, hypotension, renal dysfunction, and
rash) requires early corticosteroid therapy and haemodynamic monitoring until resolution of symptoms. Midostaurin and gilterinib may
prolong QTc interval and close electrolyte surveillance and minimizing
drug–drug interactions are required (see Section 6.4.2; Table 9;
[Supplementary data, Tables S15 and S16).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data) [423]
#### 6. Diagnosis and management of acute and subacute cardiovascular toxicity in patients receiving anticancer treatment

A coordinated MDT is recommended to discuss patients with cancer
who develop acute CV complications of their cancer treatment. [5]

Referral to a specialized cardio-oncology service is recommended
for patients with cancer who present with new CTR-CVT during
and after cancer treatment. [12] The prevention and management of
CVD in patients with cancer should generally follow published ESC
Guidelines for specific CVD. This chapter provides guidance on
the management of CTR-CVT that occur during cancer treatment,
and highlights where management differs for patients with cancer
compared with those without. The decision to initiate CV treatment


(medication, devices) needs to include consideration of a range of
factors including both cancer and CV symptom burden, cancer prognosis, ongoing cancer treatment requirements including alternative

–
options, possible adverse drug reactions, drug drug interactions,

–
and patient preferences. An extensive list of drug drug interactions
[is provided in Supplementary data, Tables S15–S17.](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data)

6.1. Cancer therapy-related cardiac
dysfunction
6.1.1. Anthracycline chemotherapy-related cardiac
dysfunction
CTRCD during anthracycline chemotherapy may present clinically or
be detected in asymptomatic patients during surveillance (Figure 10;
Table 3). [4] The diagnosis of anthracycline chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction includes new CV symptoms, new abnormalities in
cardiac function on CV imaging, and/or new increases in cardiac biomarkers (Table 3). A MDT discussion is recommended to consider
the risk/benefit ratio of continuing anthracycline chemotherapy in
patients who develop new CTRCD.
Discontinuation of anthracycline chemotherapy is recommended
in patients with cancer who develop severe symptomatic CTRCD. [22]

There are rare exceptions where rechallenge with further anthracycline chemotherapy may be considered after a MDT discussion, using
prevention strategies described below and under close monitoring
with each cycle of anthracycline chemotherapy. Temporary interruption of anthracycline chemotherapy is recommended in patients who
develop moderate symptomatic CTRCD, and in patients who develop moderate or severe asymptomatic CTRCD. A MDT approach
regarding interruption vs. continuation of anthracycline chemotherapy is recommended in patients who develop mild symptomatic

CTRCD.

Guideline-based HF therapy is recommended in patients who develop symptomatic CTRCD or asymptomatic moderate or severe
CTRCD during anthracycline chemotherapy. The use of an ACE-I/

–
ARB or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, a beta-blocker, a
sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is recommended unless the drugs are contraindicated or not tolerated. Up-titration to target doses as described in
the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute
and chronic HF is recommended. [14] ACE-I, ARB, and/or beta-blockers

should be considered in mild asymptomatic CTRCD while anthracycline chemotherapy continues uninterrupted (Figure 25). [1][,][14][,][102][,][424]

The beneficial effects of aerobic exercise before and during anthracycline chemotherapy have been demonstrated and is recommended
for patients with cancer who develop CTRCD. [11]

A MDT is recommended to discuss restarting anthracycline
chemotherapy in patients who developed mild or moderate


symptomatic CTRCD, or moderate or severe asymptomatic
CTRCD, after recovery of LV function under HF treatment. If there
is a compelling reason to continue anthracycline chemotherapy,
three other strategies exist in addition to continuing ACE-I/ARB
and beta-blockers at target doses for HF. [14] First, minimizing the
dose of anthracycline chemotherapy administered. Second, switching to liposomal anthracycline preparations. Third, pre-treatment

asymptomatic severe CTRCD (LVEF, 40%), according to the
2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute
and chronic HF, [14] is recommended to prevent worsening HF, [425]

particularly when targeted cancer therapy is continued. [427] In patients who develop CTRCD, a MDT is recommended to guide
clinical decisions. Temporary interruption is recommended
in patients who develop moderate or severe symptomatic
CTRCD or severe asymptomatic CTRCD (LVEF, 40%) during
HER2-targeted therapy. In patients with mild symptomatic
CTRCD, a MDT approach is recommended to continue vs. interrupt HER2-targeted therapy. In patients with asymptomatic mod
–
erate CTRCD (LVEF 40 49%), HER2-targeted treatment should
be continued, and cardioprotective therapy (ACE-I/ARB and betablockers) is recommended with frequent cardiac monitoring. [22][,][33][,][189] In patients with asymptomatic mild CTRCD (LVEF ≥
50% with a significant new GLS reduction and/or cardiac biomarker increase), continuing HER2-targeted treatment is recommended and cardioprotective therapy (ACE-I/ARB and/or
beta-blockers) should be considered. [22][,][211][,][428][,][429]

Frequent cardiac surveillance with cardiac imaging and cardiac
serum biomarkers is recommended in all patients with CTRCD

6.1.3. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated
myocarditis and non-inflammatory heart failure
Myocarditis is a severe complication of ICI with a high fatality
rate that most frequently develops during the first 12 weeks of
treatment, although late cases (after week 20) may occur. [386]

Other ICI-related CV toxicities include dyslipidaemia, ACS, vasculitis, AV block, supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, sudden death, TTS, non-inflammatory LVD, pericarditis, pericardial
effusion, and ischaemic stroke, with higher risks for myocarditis
(odds ratio 4.42) and dyslipidaemia (odds ratio 3.68)
(Figure 27). [323][,][325]

The diagnosis of ICI-associated myocarditis is initially based on the
presence of symptoms, a new increase in troponin (associated with
either CV symptoms or non-CV immuno-related adverse events),
and new ECG abnormalities (AV or intraventricular conduction disorders, bradycardia, tachyarrhythmias) (see Section 3;
Table 3). [17][,][434][,][435] Any abnormal finding should prompt urgent CV imaging and other causes of myocardial injury (e.g. ACS, acute infectious myocarditis) should be excluded. Treatment with high-dose
methylprednisolone should be promptly initiated in haemodynamically unstable patients (including those with ventricular arrhythmias

[VA] or complete AV block) while awaiting further confirmatory
testing. [436] TTE and CMR are recommended in all patients with suspected ICI-associated myocarditis. Currently, specific CMR features
for ICI-induced myocarditis are not well described and modified Lake
Louise criteria are recommended (Table 3). [18] Cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) may be considered [437][,][438] if CMR is not available or contraindicated, although PET
sensitivity is low and requires a strict 18-h carbohydrate-free
fast. [439] Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) should be considered in cases
where the diagnosis is suspected but not confirmed non-invasively
(e.g. conflicting results of cardiac imaging and biomarkers or clinically
unstable patients). [440] All cases of ICI-associated myocarditis should
be classified according to the severity of the myocarditis (fulminant

ESC Guidelines 4287

or non-fulminant, including symptomatic but haemodynamically and
electrically stable patients and incidental cases diagnosed at the same
time as other immune-related adverse events) to guide the management pathway (Figure 28). [331]

Interruption of ICI treatment is recommended in all cases of
suspected ICI-associated myocarditis (any patient developing
new cardiac symptoms, new cardiac arrhythmias, new heart
blocks, or new troponin increase who has received an ICI therapy
in the past 12 weeks) while investigations are performed. Once
the abnormal findings have resolved, a MDT discussion is recommended to determine the risk/benefit to permanent stopping vs.
resuming ICI treatment in patients with suspected but not confirmed myocarditis.


Cessation of ICI treatment is recommended in patients with cancer with fulminant or non-fulminant ICI-associated myocarditis and
the patient should be admitted to hospital and a level 2 or 3 bed
with continuous ECG monitoring is required. CV complications
should be treated as per specific ESC Guidelines (HF, [14] tachyarrhythmias, [441][,][442] AV block, [443] or pericardial effusion [444] ).

Treatment of both non-fulminant and fulminant ICI-associated

–
myocarditis with methylprednisolone 500 1000 mg i.v. bolus once
daily for the first 3–5 days should be started as soon as possible,
once the diagnosis is considered likely, to reduce MACE including
mortality. [386][,][436] If clinical improvement is observed (cTn reduced
by .50% from peak level within 24–72 h and any LVD, AV block,
and arrhythmias resolved), switching to oral prednisolone is

recommended starting at 1 mg/kg up to 80 mg/day. Although the
most appropriate weaning off protocol is not confirmed, a weekly
reduction of oral prednisolone (most commonly by 10 mg per
week) under clinical, ECG, and cTn surveillance should be considered (Figure 28). A reassessment of LV function and cTn should be
considered when the prednisolone dose is reduced to 20 mg/day
and then continue weaning the prednisolone by 5 mg per week to


5 mg/day, and a final reduction from 5 mg/day in 1-mg per week

steps.
If the troponin does not reduce significantly (.50% reduction
from peak) and/or AV block, ventricular arrhythmias, or LVD persist
despite 3 days of i.v. methylprednisolone plus cardiac treatments,
then steroid-resistant ICI-associated myocarditis is confirmed and
second-line immunosuppression should be considered. [22][,][445][,][446]

ESC Guidelines 4289


There is a lack of data to recommend a specific second-line immunosuppression regimen and MDT discussion is recommended. Several agents
are currently being investigated with promising results from case series
including i.v. mycophenolate mofetil, anti-thymocyte globulin (anti-CD3
antibody), i.v. immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, tocilizumab, abatacept
(CTLA-4 agonist), alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 antibody), and tofacitinib.
Caution is advised against the use of infliximab for steroid-refractory
myocarditis and HF. [447][,][448] Patients with fulminant ICI-associated myocarditis, complicated by haemodynamic and/or electrical instability, require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and cardiogenic
shock should be managed according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines for
the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic HF. [14] A single dose
of i.v. methylprednisolone should be considered in clinically unstable patients with cancer where ICI-induced myocarditis is suspected at presentation but before definitive diagnosis can be confirmed.
Following recovery from ICI-associated myocarditis and weaning
of oral steroid therapy, MDT discussion is recommended to review
the decision on whether to restart ICI treatment. This depends on
various factors including the severity of the ICI-associated myocarditis (fulminant vs. non-fulminant vs. asymptomatic), alternative oncology treatment options, metastatic vs. adjuvant/neoadjuvant
indication, and reducing from dual ICI to single ICI treatment if triggered by combination ICI treatment. [449]

Non-inflammatory HF syndromes have also been observed in patients treated with ICI. These include TTS, non-inflammatory HF or
LVD, [450] and post-MI HF. [451][,][452] Non-inflammatory HF is generally a
late event and the diagnostic workflow should be based on defining
the HF phenotype and excluding myocarditis, TTS, and ACS. [14] There

is also evidence that vasculitis and CAD can occur after ICI treatment. [335] HF treatment as per the 2021 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic HF is indicated, [14] but there is no

indication for immunosuppression if myocarditis has been excluded.
Interruption vs. continuing ICI therapy depends on the severity of
the HF syndrome and each case should be reviewed by a MDT.
Arrhythmias, such as AF, can be seen in patients with ICI therapy without myocarditis (e.g. ICI-associated thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis,
ICI-associated pericarditis, or ICI-associated severe systemic inflammatory syndromes). ICI treatment can be continued after excluding
myocarditis.

6.1.4. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell and
tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes therapies and
heart dysfunction
Although no large-scale studies on the multiple CV complications
among adults treated with CAR-T therapies exist, small studies
and case reports have shown that CV complications represent
around 20% of adverse events. [378] CV complications are associated
with high mortality rates, and are secondary to CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. The most common
CV complications in patients receiving CAR-T therapies are arrhythmias (77.6%), including QTc prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias,
and AF; HF (14.3%); and MI and VTE (0.5%). [455] When suspected, a


resting 12-lead ECG, continuous ECG monitoring, TTE, and cTn
and NP are recommended. Admission to ICU (level 3) is recommended in severe cases due to the risk of malignant cardiac arrhythmias, circulatory collapse, and multiorgan system failure. In general,
the degree of elevation of cytokines correlates with the severity of
CRS. C-reactive protein is not specific for CRS and changes in
C-reactive protein may lag behind clinical changes by ≥12 h. A dramatic elevation of interleukin-6 is a supportive finding for the diagnosis of CRS. Management of the specific CV complication should
follow ESC Guidelines, with additional management of the CRS
(e.g. the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, and
dexamethasone). [381]

ESC Guidelines 4291


Although CV complications are common with TIL therapies, survival does not appear to be significantly affected. The most frequent
CV events are hypotension that may require treatment with i.v. fluids
and pressors, AF, and to a lesser extent, cTn elevation suggestive of
myocardial damage. [380] Further research is needed to define mechanisms and potential prevention strategies to help clinicians with the
management of these CV events.

6.1.5. Heart failure during haematopoietic stem cell
transplantation
CV complications during HSCT, including congestive HF, [456] arterial
events, tamponade, and rhythm disturbances (AF, atrial flutter, and
supraventricular tachycardia), [457] are uncommon but clinically relevant, and should be treated as per specific ESC Guidelines (HF, [14] tachyarrhythmias, [273][,][441] pericardial effusion, [444] or acute coronary
syndrome [458] ). Studies of treatments during HSCT to prevent both
acute and late CV toxicity are limited. [145] ACE-I and beta-blockers
may be effective, but this requires further confirmation.
Outpatient and home-based exercise and education programmes instituted after HSCT can improve exercise capacity and quality of
life, [459] and the role of exercise pre-habilitation prior to HSCT is
being investigated. [460][,][461]

6.1.6. Takotsubo syndrome and cancer
The prevalence of malignant diseases is high in patients with TTS
and is a risk factor for worse outcomes. Malignancy itself, some
cancer treatments (5-FU, ICI, VEGFi), and the stress associated
with the diagnosis, investigations, and treatment are recognized
triggers or predisposing factors for TTS. [462][–][466] Diagnosis using
general TTS criteria is recommended. [467][,][468] Investigations in a patient with cancer with suspected TTS should include clinical examination, ECG, TTE, cardiac biomarkers (cTn and NP), and CMR
(Figure 29). [468][,][469] Most patients require invasive coronary angiography to exclude acute MI. In patients with advanced malignancy or
significant thrombocytopaenia where invasive coronary angiography is contraindicated, a CCTA is recommended. Cardiac imaging studies should be performed as early as possible when the
diagnosis is suspected as LVD can be transient, and if significant
LVD is detected then repeat imaging to confirm recovery is

recommended.

Interruption of the culprit cancer drug in patients with TTS is recommended. QT-prolonging drugs should be avoided. [467] In cases of
ICI-associated TTS, the role of immunosuppression is unknown and
if myocardial inflammation is present in a TTS pattern on CMR then
i.v. methylprednisolone is recommended given the overlap between
ICI-induced TTS and ICI-induced myocarditis. Limited information
exists regarding the feasibility of ICI rechallenge following TTS and
after recovery of LV function.
A MDT discussion is recommended after recovery from the
acute phase of TTS and, if restarting the culprit cancer drug is required from an oncology perspective, regular cardiac biomarker
monitoring is recommended (e.g. cTn and NP measured before
every ICI cycle, and TTE if a new rise in cardiac biomarkers occurs)
(Figure 29).

6.2. Coronary artery disease
6.2.1. Acute coronary syndromes

Patients with cancer are at increased risk of CAD because of shared
CVRFs [34] and CV toxicity of cancer therapy [12] compounded by a
cancer-induced pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic state
(Table 7). [467][,][468][,][470][–][473]

Current knowledge on ACS in patients with cancer is based on
observational data and registries demonstrating that, especially
when diagnosed within 1 year, they are at increased risk for major
CV events, bleeding, and cardiac and non-cardiac mortality. [474][–][480]

The proportion of ACS patients with a diagnosis of cancer is rising
and constitutes about 3% of large series. [475]

Diagnosis of ACS is based on the same principles as in patients
without cancer, including symptoms, an early 12-lead ECG, and serial
measurements of hs-cTn for patients presenting with possible
non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). [458] Clinical presentation can be atypical [481] or masked by cancer or therapy-related
side effects; therefore, diagnostic suspicion should be increased in patients at high CV risk or treated with vascular cardiotoxic therapies

(Table 7). Echocardiography improves the diagnostic precision in patients with atypical symptoms and assesses for other cardiac causes
of chest pain.
Management of ACS in patients with cancer can be challenging because of frailty, increased bleeding risk, thrombocytopaenia, increased
thrombotic risk, and the possible need for future surgery/interventions. [482] Cancer treatment should be temporarily interrupted, and
an urgent multidisciplinary approach [5] is indicated to plan an individualized guideline-based management, taking into account cancer status,
prognosis, and the patient’s preferences regarding invasive management. As in patients without cancer, admission to a monitored unit
and initiation of appropriate anti-ischaemic and antithrombotic treat
ment are indicated, in the absence of contraindications.

A large retrospective propensity score-matching analysis
found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), despite
its lower use, was strongly associated with lower adjusted
MACE and all-cause mortality in patients with cancer
(Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas and breast, lung, colon,
and prostate cancers). [483] Therefore, immediate coronary angiography and PCI are recommended in patients with cancer
and ACS if cancer prognosis is ≥6 months or if they have acute
complications of ACS (cardiogenic shock, pulmonary oedema,
ventricular tachyarrhythmias), where PCI offers palliation of
symptoms. [483] When stenting is indicated, third-generation
drug-eluting stents are preferred because of the lower risk of
in-stent thrombosis. Balloon angioplasty is associated with
worse outcome [474] and should only be used in case of severe
thrombocytopaenia or need for urgent surgery. Fractional
flow reserve or instantaneous free wave ratio are advised by
experts [484] to avoid unnecessary interventions while intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography can be used
to ensure optimal stent apposition and expansion, to avoid
thrombotic complications. [485]

Retrospective data have demonstrated a lower use of invasive
management in patients with cancer with ST-segment elevation MI
(STEMI), with a better outcome for invasively treated patients. [475][,][480][,][483] PCI has not demonstrated a mortality benefit in patients with advanced cancer and NSTE-ACS compared with optimal
medical therapy. [479] Therefore, a non-invasive approach can be attempted in low-risk (without signs or symptoms of ongoing ischaemia or haemodynamic instability) NSTE-ACS patients with poor
cancer prognosis (,6 months).
Due to a potentially higher bleeding risk (especially in patients with
active GI cancer), [477] the preferred antithrombotic strategy after
drug-eluting stent consists of DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel instead of newer P2Y12 antagonists. The duration of DAPT should be

–
kept as short as possible (1 3 months). [458] In patients with need for
therapeutic anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, a NOAC and
single oral antiplatelet (preferably clopidogrel) is the default strategy
after a short period of triple antithrombotic therapy (up to 1 week in
hospital). [458] Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery can be
considered in patients with extensive CAD who are not amenable
with PCI, after MDT discussion and where cancer prognosis is

.12 months.


Thrombocytopaenia (platelet count, 100 000/µL) is present in
about 10% of patients with cancer and may complicate ACS management. Based on a small series, coronary angiography can be safely performed in these patients when preventative measures to avoid
bleeding are taken: platelet transfusion before catheterization (for
platelets,20 000/µL), radial access, careful haemostasis, and

–
the use of a lower heparin dose (30 50 U/kg). [486] Antiplatelets should
not be withheld unless platelet count is,10 000/µL for aspirin or
,30 000/µL for clopidogrel. For PCI and CABG, experts advise minimum platelet counts of 30 000/µL and 50 000/µL, respectively. [484]

In case of MI with non-obstructive coronary arteries, CMR may be
considered to detect other causes of myocardial injury, especially
myocarditis and TTS.
When acute ischaemia is provoked by cancer therapy, alternative
cancer therapies should be considered after a MDT discussion. In the
case of coronary vasospasm secondary to fluoropyrimidines, and in
the absence of an alternative therapy, a rechallenge, although contro
versial, can be considered in a monitored unit after exclusion of se
vere CAD (CT or coronary angiography) and after initiation of
prophylactic therapy with long-acting nitrates and calcium channel
blockers (CCB). [487][–][489]

Following ACS, a review of the cancer medications is recommended, and any cancer drug associated with thrombosis and MI
should be stopped. Restarting cancer drugs associated with acute
thrombosis and MI after ACS (Table 7) should occur only after a
MDT to explore other cancer therapies, with appropriate patient
education and consent. Cancer therapies not associated with MI

can be restarted once revascularization, where indicated, has been

completed and the patient is stabilized on ACS medical therapy without complications.

6.2.2. Chronic coronary syndromes

Several cancer treatments are associated with an increased risk of
stable angina and chronic coronary syndromes (CCS). [491] 5-FU and
capecitabine can precipitate effort angina in some cases. [4][,][482][,][492]

Platinum-containing chemotherapy-induced ischaemia usually occurs
after one of the first three cycles and in patients with underlying
CAD. [493] The incidence of cardiac ischaemia is 1–5% with antimicro
tubule agents, 2–3% with small-molecule VEGF-TKI, and 0.6–1.5%
with VEGFi monoclonal antibody therapies. [492] Nilotinib, ponatinib, [494] and ICI [335] also accelerate atherosclerosis, which can lead to

stable angina.
Patients receiving cancer therapy who present with new stable angina should have careful clinical evaluation, with aggressive CVRF
modification and an initial medical management of their symptoms. [484] The diagnosis and management of CAD should follow the
2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of chronic
coronary syndromes. [100]

The management of CCS is similar in patients with and without cancer, in accordance with guideline recommendations. [100]

However, in the setting of CCS, decisions regarding coronary
revascularization should be undertaken by a MDT that includes
cardio-oncology, intervention, and oncology specialists. [5] PCI in
patients with cancer is associated with an increased risk of
bleeding, 90-day readmissions for acute MI, in-hospital and longterm mortality, and the need for repeat revascularization, with
the magnitude of risk depending on both cancer type and
stage. [495][,][496] The excess bleeding risk should be mitigated by
keeping the duration of DAPT as short as possible. [497][,][498] The
risk is higher in patients with a cancer diagnosis within the preceding year. [477]

6.3. Valvular heart disease

New or worsening VHD in patients with cancer may be related
to coexisting conditions, including CTRCD, ACS, PH, endocarditis,
cardiac tumours, and mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis. [499][,][500]

Pre-existing severe VHD is associated with an increased risk of
CTRCD, [12][,][501][–][503] and may also pose a risk for cancer surgery outcomes. In patients with mechanical prosthetic valves, the risk of
thrombosis vs. bleeding should be carefully balanced during chemotherapy treatment. In patients with severe VHD diagnosed at baseline assessment, a MDT is required before cancer therapy to
decide the best treatment option. Cardiac surgery is frequently challenging in patients with cancer because of comorbidities, frailty, mediastinal fibrosis due to prior RT, impaired wound healing, and the
need for urgent oncology treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, targeted cancer therapies that effect wound healing). Transcatheter
aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may be a viable option for patients
with cancer with severe aortic stenosis to limit recovery time and delays in starting cancer treatment. [504][–][506]

Patients with cancer suspected of new or worsening VHD, such as
dyspnoea or a new cardiac murmur, or those with fever and positive
blood cultures, should be screened for endocarditis and managed according to the recommendations from the 2021 ESC/European
Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) Guidelines for
the management of VHD, [507] while considering the cancer-related
prognosis. If valve surgery or percutaneous valve treatment is indicated in a patient receiving cancer treatment, then a MDT is recommended regarding type of valve treatment and periprocedural
management of cancer treatments.

6.4. Cardiac arrhythmias
6.4.1. Atrial fibrillation
AF may occur in patients with cancer in different settings: it may be a
marker of cancer type or occult cancer, or it may develop in patients
undergoing surgery, chemotherapy, or RT. [508][,][509] All types of cancer
show an increased risk of AF compared with the control group, but
the risk of AF depends on the cancer type and stage. [510][,][511] AF during
a cancer treatment may be caused by a specific therapy or interaction
with a pre-existing substrate in older patients with cancer.
During cancer therapy AF may occur with a frequency ranging
from 2% to 16%, according to a variety of factors, [4][,][490][,][508][,][512][–][514]

and may present either as first-diagnosed AF or as recurrence of paroxysmal AF. The risk of developing AF is greater in patients older
than 65 years and/or with pre-existing CVD. [4][,][509][,][512][,][515] Cancer surgery is associated with a variable rate of AF occurrence, with the
highest incidence reported for lung surgery, ranging from 6% to
32%, but with occurrence also in cases of non-thoracic surgery

–
(e.g. 4 5% after colectomy). [509]

Many anticancer drugs have been associated with an increased risk
[of AF both in terms of incident and recurrent AF (Supplementary](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data)
[data, Table S18).](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data) [251] AF may occur shortly after treatment [516] or
weeks or months after starting treatment. [517][,][518] The pathophysiology of AF associated with cancer is complex and has been extensively reviewed elsewhere (Figure 30). [509]

In patients with cancer, the occurrence of AF is associated with a
two-fold higher risk of systemic thromboembolism/stroke and a sixfold increase in the risk of HF. [4][,][509][,][512] The coexistence of cancer in
creases the risk of all-cause mortality, major bleeding, and intracranial
haemorrhage in patients with AF. The association between cancer
and ischaemic stroke differs between cancer types, and in some
types, the risk of bleeding seems to exceed the thromboembolic
risk. [519] The management of AF in patients with cancer should follow
the 2020 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of atrial
fibrillation [273] and the ‘ABC pathway’ (Atrial fibrillation Better Care)
approach should be applied (A: Anticoagulation to avoid stroke/systemic embolism, B: Better symptom control with rate- and/or
rhythm-control drugs and interventions, and C: Comorbidities and
CVRF management, including lifestyle changes). [273][,][520]

The acute management of AF in patients with cancer should consider electrical cardioversion in cases of haemodynamic instability, [521]

while in others, the alternative between rate and rhythm control has
several important considerations specific to patients with cancer.
Drugs for rhythm control may lead to QT-interval prolongation, [369]

–
frequently have drug drug interactions with cancer therapies, or


may have a limited efficacy if a cancer therapy is the specific cause
of the AF. [508] Among rate-control drugs, beta-blockers are preferred,
especially if the cancer therapies have potential CTRCD risk, whereas diltiazem and verapamil should be avoided where possible due to
their drug–drug interactions and negative inotropic effects. [508] The
possibility of AF ablation should be discussed in selected patients
with HF/LVD and/or uncontrolled symptoms, taking into consideration cancer status and prognosis in the context of a MDT
approach. [522]

A complex issue in patients with cancer with new AF is risk stratification for stroke/systemic embolism, which according to guidelines,
should be based on the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years [2 points], Diabetes mellitus,

— –
Stroke [2 points] Vascular disease, Age 65 74 years, Sex category

[female]). [273][,][523][,][524] The CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score has not been extensively validated in patients with cancer. [525] In a large cohort of patients
with AF, the predictive value of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was lower
in patients with cancer than in those without, but a progressive increase in the risk of ischaemic stroke according to the
CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was also found in AF patients with cancer
(from 0.9% per year to 8.9% per year). [519] However, the scope of
this score is not to identify high-risk patients, but rather to identify
low-risk individuals in whom anticoagulation can be avoided. A study
based on the Danish healthcare system data set found that
CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc scores of 0 and 1 in patients with recent cancer
were linked with higher risk of stroke/thromboembolism at 2 years
than in patients without recent cancer. [526] This concept should be
considered in defining the risk/benefit ratio of anticoagulation in individual patients with cancer. Therefore, the decision for anticoagulation in patients with an active malignancy should take into account
the enhanced thrombotic and/or bleeding risk and other risk prediction scores used for general AF populations. [509] For bleeding risk assessment, the HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal and liver
function, Stroke, Bleeding Labile international normalized ratio,
Elderly, Drugs or alcohol) score may be considered. A proposed approach to anticoagulation therapy in cancer, based on the acronym T
(thrombotic risk), B (bleeding risk), I (interactions among drugs), P
(patient access and preferences), is outlined in Figure 31. [519][,][527]

Long-term anticoagulation is recommended in adult patients with
CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥2 in men or ≥3 in women and must be considered also when the score is 1 in men and 2 in women. [273] The clin
ical pattern of AF (i.e. first detected, paroxysmal, persistent,
long-standing persistent, permanent, post-operative) should not influence the indication of thromboprophylaxis. [273] The same approach
can be proposed for patients with cancer and AF, also considering
that the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score likely underestimates their thromboembolic risk. [530] In the specific setting of cancer, decision-making on
long-term oral anticoagulation should also consider the cancerrelated type, stage, prognosis and the potentially changing thromboembolic or bleeding risk. [508][,][509] The use of vitamin K antagonists
(VKA) in cancer is limited by their drawbacks in this setting; however,
they remain the only indicated anticoagulants in patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical prosthetic valve.
LMWH constitute a viable short-term anticoagulation option, particularly in hospitalized patients with a recent cancer diagnosis, advanced cancer disease, or during some cancer treatments (e.g.

[a] In selected patients, cardiac imaging parameters related to increased thromboembolic risk should be considered (LAA thrombus, severely dilated left atrium, severely impaired

000/µL. According to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, [529] major bleeding is defined as a fall in haemoglobin level ≥2 g/dL and/or
transfusion of ≥2 units of red blood cells and/or fatal bleeding and/or bleeding in a critical area (intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, pericardial,
intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal). [c] Percutaneous left appendage closure may be considered in patients with a life expectancy of .1 year who are at high thromboembolic and bleeding risk and in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated. [d] Conditions

interactions, platelet count,50 000/µL.

ESC Guidelines 4297


—
complications related to the implant including device-related thrombosis—and the lack of prospective data in the setting of patients with
cancer have to be taken into consideration for this option. In a recent
retrospective analysis of patients referred to LAA occlusion the risk of
in-hospital ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack was higher in
patients with active cancer than in those with no cancer or prior history of cancer. The rate of in-hospital composite outcome (in-hospital
death, ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack, systemic embolism,
bleeding requiring blood transfusion, pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade treated with pericardiocentesis or surgically, and removal of
embolized device) and 30-day/180-day readmission outcomes were
not significantly different between the groups. [539]

The onset of AF may be related to transient factors, such as the
peri-operative period or the effect of drugs known to facilitate AF
onset. The traditional assumption that in these cases, AF may occur
as an isolated event without recurrence may not be valid as the occurrence of AF may often be related to a pre-existing atrial substrate
with vulnerability to AF. [540] Post-operative AF has been associated
with a four- to five-fold risk of AF recurrence in the following 5 years,
along with a comparable long-term thromboembolic risk with AF not
related to surgery. [273][,][540][,][541] Anticoagulation therapy yielded a similarly lower risk of thromboembolic events and all-cause death in
both groups. [541] In the absence of direct evidence, anticoagulation
to prevent thromboembolic events should be considered in patients
at risk for stroke with AF after cancer surgery considering the anticipated net clinical benefit and informed patient preferences. [273]

Similarly, in patients with AF apparently related to transient factors

—
such as chemotherapy, other drugs, or electrolyte disturbances

—
a careful clinical assessment of the propensity to further develop
AF is recommended, with need to revisit the risk/benefit ratio of
long-term prescription of anticoagulation after a period of 3 months.
In patients with cancer and newly detected or recurrence of AF, decision making on anticancer treatment requires a cardio-oncology MDT
management, [5] taking into account that neither the presence nor the risk
of AF constitutes contraindications to anticancer treatment. [508][,][517]

4298 ESC Guidelines


6.4.2. Long corrected QT interval and ventricular
arrhythmias
VA are not common during cancer, although their incidence increases in patients with advanced cancer and CV comorbidities. [49][,][259][,][516][,][542] Mechanisms proposed to explain cancer
therapy-induced VA include: (1) direct effects of cancer drugs on
the activity/expression of ionic channels that regulate the ventricular
action potential, [4][,][369][,][442][,][516][,][542][,][543] and (2) a permanent arrhythmogenic substrate created by cancer and systemic inflammation caused
by cancer, pre-existing CV comorbidities, and/or a new
CTR-CVT. [4][,][9][,][259][,][369][,][442][,][516][,][542][,][543]

Treatment of cancer therapy-induced VA should follow general
clinical guidelines. [22][,][442][,][544] In patients with asymptomatic selfterminating VA, drug discontinuation is not required unless they
have additional CVRF or persistent ECG abnormalities. [270]

Symptomatic VA require cancer drug dose reduction or discontinuation and patients should be referred to the cardiologist for evaluation and treatment. [4][,][442]

Recurrent symptomatic life-threatening VA require urgent intervention. [4][,][270][,][442][,][544] The administration of class IA, IC, and III anti
–
arrhythmic drugs is limited by the risk of drug drug interactions
and QTc prolongation. Beta-blockers and class IB drugs are less likely
to cause drug interactions or QTc prolongation. Beta-blockers are
the preferred choice if the cancer drug is also associated with
CTRCD. Amiodarone is the antiarrhythmic drug of choice in patients
with structural heart disease and haemodynamic instability.

Decisions on the use of antiarrhythmic drugs or device therapy (cardioverter defibrillators, catheter ablation) should consider life expectancy, quality of life, and complication risks. [349]

Most cancer therapy-induced VA are related to a prolongation of
QTc leading to the development of TdP. [259][,][516][,][542] Risk factors for
QTc prolongation and TdP are summarized in Table 8. [4][,][22][,][45][,][48][,][516][,][543]

Although there is no threshold of QTc prolongation at which TdP
can occur, a QTc ≥ 500 ms is associated with a two- to three-fold

higher risk for TdP, while TdP rarely occurs when QTc is


,500 ms. [442] Although the incidence of QTc prolongation
≥500 ms and TdP is low during cancer therapy, QTc prolongation
to levels that require closer monitoring (QTc ≥ 480 ms) is more
common (Table 9). [4][,][9][,][22][,][45][,][48][,][49][,][259][,][369][,][516][,][543][,][546] Changes in the QT
interval of .60 ms from baseline should not routinely affect treatment decisions if the QTc remains,500 ms. [1] Cardiology consultation is advised in patients with an abnormal baseline QTc interval,
patients treated with drugs that prolong the QT interval, those
who develop new cardiac symptoms (syncope or pre-syncope, rapid
palpitations or QTc prolongation with new-onset bradycardia, high
degree of heart block), and/or those with known inherited arrhythmia

disorders. [4][,][45][,][48][,][442][,][544] The challenges for the cardio-oncology teams
are to identify patients more susceptible to developing VA, determine
whether a VA is directly due to CTR-CVT, individualize the treatment
strategy, and optimize clinical monitoring during treatment.

Figure 32 shows the algorithm for the management of QTc prolongation during cancer therapy. In patients with cancer, the

Fridericia formula is recommended and has demonstrated less error

than other correction methods such as Bazzett at both high and low
heart rates. [44] In patients treated with QTc-prolonging drugs, serum
electrolytes and other risk factors should be closely monitored and
corrected, and concomitant QT-prolonging drugs avoided if possible. [4][,][22][,][45][,][369][,][543] For selected cancer drugs, there are specific manufacturer recommendations for ECG monitoring during treatment,
dosage adjustments, or discontinuation of therapy in case of QTc
prolongation. [548]

Although there are no recommendations, patients with cancer
with QTc prolongation associated with severe bradycardia or sinus
pauses may benefit from isoprenaline infusion or temporary pacing. Despite present restrictions, the improved prognosis for
many malignancies is increasing the number of patients with cancer
who are candidates for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
(ICD), particularly when life expectancy is .1 year (including patients who experienced resuscitated sudden cardiac death or severe VA from a QTc-prolonging drug with no alternative
treatment available).

6.4.3. Bradyarrhythmias
AV conduction disease can be caused by ICI in the presence or absence of myocarditis. If the PR interval increases (new first-degree
heart block) in patients treated with ICI, serial ECG monitoring is recommended, and if PR prolongation to .300 ms develops, the patient should be hospitalized under close ECG monitoring and i.v.
methylprednisolone is recommended. [550]

IMiD (thalidomide, pomalidomide) [285] and ALK inhibitors (crizotinib, alectinib, brigatinib, or ceritinib) [551] are associated with sinus
bradycardia. Holter ECG monitoring is recommended to exclude
significant sinus pauses in symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients with normal LV function, sinus bradycardia is usually well tolerated and treatment can continue. If patients are symptomatic
(syncope, pre-syncope of reduced exercise tolerance from chronotropic incompetence) then a trial of cancer drug withdrawal to confirm causation with the symptoms is recommended. A MDT
discussion is needed to analyse risks/benefits of alternative cancer
therapies vs. restarting the culprit cancer therapy at a lower dose
with heart rate monitoring. In selected cases, when no cancer treatment alternative is available, pacing is indicated.

6.5. Arterial hypertension
Arterial hypertension in patients with cancer may be caused by their
cancer treatments (e.g. VEGFi, second- and third-generation
BCR-ABL TKI, brigatinib, ibrutinib, fluoropyrimidines, cisplatin, abiraterone, bicalutamide, enzalutamide), non-cancer drugs (e.g. corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and other
factors including stress, pain, excessive alcohol consumption, renal
impairment, untreated sleep apnoea, obesity, and reduced exercise. [552] In all patients with cancer with new hypertension assessment,
correction of these other factors is important before considering
interruption of a cancer treatment.
Untreated hypertension [344] is a confirmed risk factor of HF during
treatment with anthracyclines, [553] ibrutinib, [264] and VEGFi. [554] Given
that many of the cancer therapies that cause hypertension also cause

ESC Guidelines 4301


CTRCD, treatment of hypertension with ACE-I or ARB as first-line
therapy is recommended to reduce the risk of CTRCD.
Combination therapy with an ACE-I or ARB and a dihydropyridine
CCB is recommended in patients with cancer with systolic BP ≥
160 mmHg and diastolic BP ≥ 100 mmHg due to the more rapid onset of BP control with the combination compared with ACE-I/ARB
monotherapy (Figures 33 and 34).
If severe hypertension is diagnosed (systolic BP ≥ 180 mmHg or
diastolic BP ≥ 110 mmHg), the competing cancer and CV risks
should be evaluated by a MDT, and any cancer therapy associated
with hypertension should be deferred or temporarily withheld until
the BP is controlled to values,160 mmHg (systolic BP) and
,100 mmHg (diastolic BP). Culprit cancer therapy can be restarted

once BP is controlled, with consideration for dose reduction.


In patients with resistant cancer therapy-related hypertension,
spironolactone, oral or transdermal nitrates, and/or hydralazine
should be considered. In patients with cancer with evidence of
high sympathetic tone, stress, and/or pain, beta-blockers including
carvedilol or nebivolol should be considered. Diuretics, preferably
spironolactone, may be considered in patients with cancer with
hypertension and evidence of increased fluid retention, with monitoring of BP, electrolytes, and renal function.
The decisions to initiate BP treatment and BP targets during the
management of cancer-drug induced hypertension depend upon
the context of the cancer and prognosis (Figure 34). CS should be
treated according to the 2018 ESC/European Society of
Hypertension (ESH) Guidelines for the management of arterial
hypertension. [138]

ESC Guidelines 4303


6.6. Thrombosis and thromboembolic

events

Thromboembolic events that develop during cancer and its treatment encompass both VTE and arterial thromboembolism (ATE)
and are collectively referred to as cancer-associated thrombosis.
Cancer-associated thrombosis is determined by the prothrombotic
milieu induced by cancer, the prothrombotic properties of certain
anticancer and adjunctive therapies, and patient-related risk
factors, including demographics, genetic predisposition, and
comorbidities. [513]

6.6.1. Venous thromboembolism

VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and PE, is the
second-leading cause of death in patients with malignancies. [558]


Cancer confers a five-fold higher risk of VTE and cancer-associated
VTE represents 30% of all VTE cases. [559][,][560] The risk of VTE varies
in the course of cancer, with the highest risk occurring in the period
following cancer diagnosis, during hospitalization and chemotherapy,
and upon development of metastatic disease. [561][,][562] Unprovoked
VTE may be the first clinical sign of a malignancy, followed by a 5%
incidence of cancer diagnosis during the subsequent 12 months. [563]

The risk factors for VTE in cancer are summarized in
Figure 35. [564][,][565] Patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of
VTE, such as unilateral lower limb oedema or unexplained dyspnoea,
should be screened with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography
or contrast-enhanced CT for DVT and CT pulmonary angiography
for PE, according to the 2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and
management of acute pulmonary embolism recommendations [566]

and the second consensus document on diagnosis and management
of acute deep vein thrombosis. [567]

6.6.2. Arterial thromboembolism

Cancer carries a two-fold higher risk of ATE, including MI and ischaemic stroke. [568] ATE risk is higher in men, with advanced age, and in
patients with lung or kidney cancer. Pathologies related to ATE in
cancer include ischaemic stroke induced by AF or RT-induced carotid artery disease, embolization by tumour cells or non-bacterial
thrombotic endocarditis, disseminated intravascular coagulationrelated peripheral microcirculatory thromboembolism, paradoxical

cerebral embolism in the course of VTE, and cerebral sinus
thrombosis. [569]


6.6.3. Intracardiac thrombosis

Intracardiac thrombus in patients with malignancies may result from
the prothrombotic properties of cancer and its treatment and the

use of central venous catheters. Thrombus is the most common in
tracardiac mass and it can occur within any cardiac chamber. Right

atrial thrombi are often related to a venous catheter where the

line has inappropriately advanced into the right atrium.
Intraventricular thrombi usually occur in the setting of CTRCD.
LAA thrombi are most commonly associated with AF, which may
also be related to cancer or its therapy.
Patients with systemic embolization should be screened for cardiac origin of thrombus initially with TTE and/or transoesophageal
echocardiography. [528] CMR is more sensitive and specific than TTE

intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal). [b] Conditions favouring LMWH: unoperated GI/GU cancer; GI comorbidities or toxicity; severe renal dysfunction (CrCl, 15 mL/min); NOAC major drug–drug interactions, platelet

ESC Guidelines 4305


for detecting intracardiac thrombi and late gadolinium enhancement
(LGE) CMR with the long inversion time technique is currently considered the gold standard. [570][,][571]

6.6.4. Anticoagulation therapy
Patients with cancer frequently have both an increased thrombotic risk
and an increased bleeding risk associated with certain cancer locations
(e.g. GI, intracranial), thrombocytopaenia, and other coagulation defects (secondary to bone marrow invasion, cancer therapies, or cancer
itself) and associated comorbidities (e.g. renal or hepatic dysfunction,
GI toxicities). Several anticancer agents are further characterized by

–
drug drug interactions with anticoagulants. All these factors may render anticoagulation in cancer quite challenging. A proposed approach
to anticoagulation therapy in cancer-associated venous thrombosis,
based on the TBIP acronym (Thromboembolic risk, Bleeding risk,
drug–drug Interactions, Patient preferences), is outlined in Figure 36. [527]

6.6.4.1. Treatment and secondary prevention of venous
thromboembolism

Several large RCTs and meta-analyses have shown that LMWH decrease the risk of recurrent VTE by 40% compared to VKA, with a
similar risk of major bleeding. [572][–][576] However, VKA are characterized by an unpredictable anticoagulation effect and low time in thera
–
peutic range in patients with malignancies due to multiple drug drug
interactions, GI toxicity, malnutrition, and liver dysfunction. [577]

NOAC have been assessed as potential alternatives to LMWH for
cancer-associated VTE, based on RCTs that compared edoxaban, rivaroxaban or apixaban to dalteparin. [578][–][583] The totality of evidence derived by these trials and subsequent meta-analyses [584][–][586] shows that
NOAC are non-inferior to dalteparin in reducing the risk of VTE recurrence. The risk of major bleeding was similar, although NOAC were associated with an increased risk of clinically relevant non-major bleeding,
particularly in patients with luminal GI and GU malignancies. [586] As a result, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and apixaban are recommended for the
treatment of VTE (DVT and PE) in patients with cancer without any
of the following bleeding risk factors: unoperated GI or GU malignan
                                         cies, history of recent bleeding or within 7 days of major surgery, signifi
cant thrombocytopaenia (platelet count, 50000/µL), severe renal
dysfunction (creatinine clearance (CrCl, 15 mL/min), or GI comorbidities. [582][,][586] In addition, drug–drug interactions between NOAC, cancer
therapies, and other concomitant treatments should be checked. [587]

There are also concerns about NOAC in patients with GI toxicity
such as vomiting or those having undergone gastrectomy or extensive
intestine resection, as well as those with severely impaired renal function. Shared decision-making considering informed patient preferences
should guide the choice of anticoagulation.
Incidentally encountered proximal DVT or PE should be treated in
the same manner as symptomatic VTE as they bear similar rates of
recurrence and mortality. [588]

The minimal duration of anticoagulation is 6 months and extended
anticoagulation is suggested in the presence of active malignancy,
metastatic disease, or chemotherapy use. Cohort studies have
shown that extended LMWH therapy beyond 6 and up to 12 months
is safe in cancer-associated VTE. [589][,][590] However, patients with cancer are also at high risk of bleeding during anticoagulant treatment
and a periodic assessment of the risk/benefit ratio should performed.


In VTE relapse under anticoagulation, the patient should be investigated for treatment adherence, cancer progression or relapse, while a
different anticoagulation strategy should be endorsed (e.g. replacement
of NOAC with LMWH). The management of patients with VTE and a
platelet count,25000/µL should be individualized by a MDT. [299]

The duration of anticoagulation in patients with catheterassociated thrombosis depends upon whether the catheter is removed or remains in situ. If removed, then anticoagulation should
continue for a minimum of 3 months and until follow-up cardiac imaging confirms resolution of the thrombus. If the catheter remains in
situ, then long-term therapeutic anticoagulation should continue.

6.6.4.2. Primary prevention of venous thromboembolism
Patients undergoing surgery and those who are hospitalized or in
prolonged bed rest require thromboprophylaxis with low-dose anticoagulation. [298][,][299][,][592][–][594] The ENOXACAN (Enoxaparin and

4306 ESC Guidelines


Cancer) II study showed favourable outcomes with LMWH as primary thromboprophylaxis for 4 weeks after major abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery. [595] For ambulatory patients, VTE risk should be
individually determined and proposed scores such as the Khorana
or the COMPASS-CAT (prospective COmparison of Methods for
thromboembolic risk assessment with clinical Perceptions and

—
AwareneSS in real-life patients Cancer Associated Thrombosis)
score may be useful. [596][,][597] Further trials and a meta-analysis have
shown that LMWH significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic
VTE in ambulatory patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy with
acceptable safety. [598][–][600] Two randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind clinical trials have assessed the role of NOAC in primary
prevention of VTE in high-risk ambulatory patients receiving systemic
cancer therapy (Khorana score ≥ 2). [601][,][602] Over a follow-up period of

                                         180 days, apixaban (2.5 mg twice a day) [601] therapy resulted in a signifi
cantly lower rate of VTE, although the rate of major bleeding episodes
was higher than with placebo. Rivaroxaban (10 mg once a day) [602]

treatment resulted in a non-significantly lower incidence of VTE or
death due to VTE with low bleeding risk (no significant differences
with placebo). Further data on the use of NOAC in this setting are
warranted. Consideration of such therapy should be accompanied
by a discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and harms,
cancer prognosis, drug cost, and duration of prophylaxis.

6.7. Bleeding complications
Bleeding complications are more common in patients with cancer
than in patients without cancer. This may be directly related to the
tumour itself, or indirectly related to chemotherapy- or
RT-induced weakening of mucosal barriers. [530]

6.7.1. High-risk patients
GI and GU cancers are associated with a significant excess bleeding
risk compared with other solid tumours. [603] Thrombocytopaenia
and platelet dysfunction due to haematological malignancies or
bone marrow suppression can exacerbate bleeding. Other bleeding risk factors include advancing age, renal or hepatic impairment, metastatic disease, low body mass index, and treatment
with ibrutinib, VEGFi, cetuximab, or bevacizumab. [578][,][603][–][605]

Gastric protection with routine proton pump inhibitor use
should be considered in all patients with cancer on DAPT [606][,][607]

or anticoagulation. [530]

6.7.2. Antiplatelet therapy
Antiplatelet therapy, in particular DAPT, increases the risk of bleeding in patients with cancer. [477] Following ACS and/or PCI, the risk of
bleeding is approximately 1.6-fold greater in patients with cancer
than in those without. [477][,][605] The risk is greatest in those diagnosed
with cancer in the preceding year, whereas more remote cancers
carry lower excess risk. [477] The PRECISE-DAPT (PREdicting bleeding
Complications In patients undergoing Stent implantation and
subsEquent Dual Anti Platelet Therapy) score appears not to perform well for predicting bleeding in patients with cancer. [477] In order
to reduce bleeding risk, the duration and intensity of DAPT should be
minimized [477][,][607] and triple therapy avoided whenever possible. At

the same time, DAPT—if indicated—should not be withheld without

good reason. A recent expert consensus statement suggests reduced
platelet count thresholds for CV therapies, recommending aspirin
initiation for platelet counts .10 000/µL and DAPT initiation (with
aspirin and clopidogrel) for platelet counts .30 000/µL. [608] In patients with platelet counts,50 000/µL, clopidogrel is preferred
over prasugrel or ticagrelor, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors
should be avoided. [608] To reduce peri-procedural bleeding, PCI
should preferably be undertaken via the radial approach [484] and
prophylactic platelet transfusion may be considered for patients
with platelet count,20 000/µL. [609]

6.7.3. Management of bleeding
Basic principles of bleeding management should be followed with
control of the bleeding source whenever possible. Platelet transfusions for significant thrombocytopaenia and withholding and reversal
of anticoagulation for life-threatening bleeding may be needed as in
the general population. [530][,][610] Antifibrinolytic agents, such as tranexamic acid or e-aminocaproic acid, can be considered. Non-specific
support of haemostasis using coagulation factor concentrates and
specific reversal agents may be needed for patients on a NOAC
with life-threatening bleeding. [530] Recombinant activated factor VII
or activated prothrombin complex concentrates should be avoided
in patients with recent thrombosis.

ESC Guidelines 4307


6.8. Peripheral artery disease
There is growing evidence that cancer therapy affects the vasculature. A recent meta-analysis showed a significantly increased arterial
stiffness after anthracycline and non-anthracycline treatment. [611]

Paraneoplastic acral vascular syndrome was described after initiation
of nivolumab, with first symptoms 3 weeks after initiation of therapy. [612] Raynaud phenomenon has been associated with the use of
bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids,
and fluoropyrimidines. [491] Usual treatment of Raynaud’s includes
non-pharmacological measures to help prevent an episode (avoidance of provoking factors such as cold temperature, vasoconstricting
drugs) and a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB (amlodipine,
modified-release nifedipine).
Treatment with nilotinib or ponatinib may be associated with an
increased risk of vascular adverse events, including arterial stiffness
and PAD development. [494] In a subgroup of patients, these events
are severe or even life-threatening. [613] Although the exact mechanisms remain unknown, we recommend screening for pre-existing
PAD and for vascular risk factors such as DM in all patients before
and during nilotinib or ponatinib therapy. Pooled data from three

clinical trials showed arterial occlusive disease to be related to
dose intensity in ponatinib-treated patients, [614] but PAD was not addressed separately. If rapidly progressive PAD occurs with secondgeneration TKI, it may be advisable to switch to an alternative lowerrisk TKI (e.g. imatinib). Platelet aggregation inhibitors or anticoagulation and statins should be considered. Despite lack of evidence, all
risk factors should be corrected. [615]

6.9. Pulmonary hypertension
All five groups of the PH classification can be observed in patients
with cancer. Several cancer drugs can cause group 1 PH (pulmonary
arterial hypertension [PAH]), including carfilzomib, bosutinib, dasatinib, [616] ponatinib, interferon alpha, and alkylating agents (e.g. mitomycin C and cyclophosphamide, which mostly cause pulmonary
veno-occlusive disease). [617] PH associated with left heart disease
(group 2) is related to drugs causing HF (e.g. anthracyclines). PH associated with lung disease (group 3) is related to drugs and therapies
causing pulmonary fibrosis (e.g. bleomycin, thoracic radiation). The
most common pulmonary vascular disease complicating cancer is
VTE, which can cause chronic thromboembolic PH (group 4). Of
note, central venous catheters are important causes of group 4 PH


complicating cancer management. Other group 4 PH due to pulmonary artery obstructions includes angiosarcoma and other malignant
tumours (e.g. renal carcinoma, uterine carcinoma, germ cell tumours
of the testis). [618]

PH with unclear and/or multifactorial mechanisms (group 5) includes several conditions that may be complicated by complex and
sometimes overlapping pulmonary vascular involvement. Tumoral
PH includes pulmonary tumour micro-embolism and pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy. [619] Multiple causes of PH have
been described in patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders.
In chronic myelogenous leukaemia, spleen enlargement and anaemia
can give rise to hyperkinetic syndrome. In polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, there is an increased risk of VTE and

chronic thromboembolic PH. Moreover, formation of a blood clot

–
within the hepatic veins can lead to Budd Chiari syndrome and subsequent porto-PH. Pulmonary extramedullary haematopoiesis complicating idiopathic or secondary myelofibrosis may also contribute
to dyspnoea and PH. [620]

Symptoms of PH are non-specific, such as shortness of breath and
fatigue. In later stages, symptoms of right-sided HF may develop. An
ECG should be performed and examined for RV hypertrophy, but a
normal ECG does not exclude PH. Echocardiography is the first
choice for assessing PH probability in patients who develop symptoms and/or signs suggestive of PH during cancer treatment.
When peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) is ≤2.8 m/s
(equating to an estimated systolic PAP [sPAP] of ≤35 mmHg)
and no other signs of PH are present, then the probability of PH
is low. In the absence of a tricuspid regurgitant jet, other echocardiography signs may increase suspicion of PH (e.g. RV/LV basal
diameter ratio . 1, RV outflow tract acceleration time, 105 ms,
inferior vena cava diameter . 21 mm with decreased inspiratory collapse). [620] Baseline TTE should be considered in patients receiving
cancer drugs that can cause PH; however, a right-heart catheterization is required for definitive diagnosis of PH and to support
PAH treatment decisions. In the DASISION (DASatinib vs. Imatinib
Study In treatment-Naïve chronic myeloid leukemia patients) trial,
5% of patients randomized to dasatinib were diagnosed with
PH, compared with 0.4% of those randomized to imatinib. [621] In
patients who develop PH, dasatinib treatment should be interrupted and an alternative TKI should be used. [616]

Overall management of PH in oncology patients should be based
on the 2022 ESC/European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines for
the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension. [620] Referral
to a PH centre is recommended for multidisciplinary management
with the oncology team. In patients with CML treated with drugs
causing PH-induced PAH, discontinuation of the potential culprit
therapy is recommended if there is a high probability of new PH
(peak TRV . 3.4 m/s, equating to an estimated sPAP of
≥50 mmHg) until the diagnosis is confirmed or ruled out by a rightheart catheterization. In CML patients on dasatinib, an alternative
BCR-ABL TKI is recommended if they develop symptomatic PAH
or an asymptomatic increase in peak TRV .3.4 m/s. Dasatinib
dose reduction and close monitoring of peak TRV with TTE every
4 weeks should be considered in CML patients who develop new
asymptomatic peak TRV ranging from 2.9 to 3.4 m/s. [620] If peak
TRV remains normal or mildly elevated on serial monitoring, then dasatinib can continue, with reduced TTE monitoring to every 3

4308 ESC Guidelines


months. If peak TRV continues to rise, then right-heart catheterization should be performed, dasatinib treatment should be stopped,
and PAH drugs should be considered if PAH is confirmed.

6.10. Pericardial diseases

Pericarditis and pericardial effusion can be related to a wide range of
cancer treatments including chest radiation, cytotoxic therapies (anthracyclines, bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine), targeted
therapies (all-trans retinoic acid, arsenic trioxide, dasatinib), and
immune-based therapies (interleukin-2, interferon-αICI). A combination of therapies may have a synergistic effect on the pericardium.
These therapy-induced complications must be differentiated from
progressive cancer (local invasion, metastatic involvement, or mediastinal lymphatic drainage obstruction) and non-cancer-related causes
such as infection, especially in immune-compromised patients. [622] A
careful history and clinical examination are of help to determine the
cause. TTE plays a central role in diagnosis and management. CT
and CMR can provide additional information on pericardial inflammation and constrictive physiology. The principles for the diagnosis and
management should follow the 2015 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis
and management of pericardial diseases, [444] but there are some specific
issues to consider in patients with cancer. [482]

6.10.1. Pericarditis

The diagnosis of pericarditis in patients with cancer follows the same
principles as in those without, but symptoms can be atypical. [444]

Acute pericarditis caused by radiation has become rare due to lower
doses and improved radiation techniques. It occurs within days to
weeks after treatment and is usually self-limiting, but can evolve towards constrictive pericarditis many years later (Section 8.6).
Pericarditis caused by conventional cancer therapies often resolves


with standard therapy or after discontinuation of the treatment. [444]

Cancer treatment interruption should be discussed with the
cardio-oncology team. Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs
(e.g. ibuprofen) and colchicine, in the absence of contraindications,
is recommended as it reduces the rate of recurrence requiring repeat intervention. [623] Low-to-moderate doses of steroids are only indicated for resistant cases except ICI-related pericarditis. [444]

ICI-associated pericarditis has a median time of onset of 30 days in
retrospective surveillance studies and is associated with a poor prognosis, especially in case of concomitant myocarditis. [444][,][624]

In patients with severe ICI-associated pericarditis with moderate or
severe effusion, ICI discontinuation and high-dose steroids (methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day) with or without colchicine are recommended, as
well as pericardiocentesis in case of cardiac tamponade. [624][,][625] In case of
refractory pericarditis, immunosuppressive drugs should be considered.
For uncomplicated ICI-related pericarditis, the ICI might be continued
and colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could be considered. [326][,][444] For patients requiring ICI discontinuation, restarting ICI
can be considered in a MDT discussion after resolution of pericardial
disease and under close monitoring.

6.10.2. Pericardial effusion

Pericardial effusions are often observed as an incidental finding in patients with cancer. Cancer therapy is the cause of a pericardial effusion in,30% of cases, although this may increase with the expanding
use of ICI in cancer. Malignancy-related pericardial effusions caused
by direct (lung, oesophageal, breast) or metastatic invasion (haematological malignancies, ovarian, melanoma) or by lymph node obstruction are generally associated with poor prognosis.
Clinical presentation depends on the size of the effusion and the
speed of its growth. [444] Malignancy-related pericardial effusions
make up .30% of patients presenting with cardiac tamponade [626]

and usually develop slowly, resulting in larger pericardial effusions
at the time of diagnosis compared with non-malignant pericardial effusions. Management consists of determination of the cause and
evaluation of the haemodynamic impact. Small-to-medium-sized effusions (.4 and,20 mm) can be monitored with a reassessment
7–14 days after initial diagnosis and at further 4–6-weekly intervals. [444][,][627] In unstable patients with signs of tamponade, immediate
echocardiographic-guided percutaneous pericardiocentesis is preferred over surgical pericardiotomy to minimize potential complications. [628] In patients with cardiac tamponade due to malignant
pericardial effusions, colchicine may be useful to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the rate of repeat intervention. [623] Drainage of a
pericardial effusion related to ICI is rarely required [629] and corticosteroids should be considered. [630] Intrapericardial instillation of
cytostatic/sclerosing agents, colchicine, [623] and radiation for
radiation-sensitive tumours can reduce recurrence after drainage.
The creation of a pleuropericardial or pleuroperitoneal window
with balloon pericardiotomy or surgery should be considered in
case of recurrent malignant pericardial effusions after emergency
pericardiocentesis. [444]

A surgical pericardial window should be considered if the percutaneous approach is not feasible and in stable patients with large
(≥20 mm) or rapidly expanding malignant pericardial effusions prior
to the development of cardiac tamponade.

#### 7. End-of-cancer therapy cardiovascular risk assessment

7.1. Cardiovascular evaluation during the
first year after cardiotoxic anticancer
therapy
End-of-cancer therapy CV risk assessment covers the first 12

months after the last cardiotoxic cancer treatment. These recom
mendations are where cardiotoxic cancer therapy has been successfully completed with good long-term prognosis. These
recommendations are not indicated when cancer therapies are discontinued due to cancer progression and prognosis is poor, or
where end-of-life care is indicated. Selected patients with cancer


continue on long-term oncology therapies, e.g. women with oestrogen receptor-positive early invasive BC. In this example, the
end-of-therapy risk assessment refers to the timepoint from the
last anthracycline or trastuzumab dose.
High-risk patients can be identified at completion of their cardiotoxic cancer therapies by their clinical characteristics, history of
CTR-CVT during treatment, and by elevated cardiac biomarkers
and/or abnormal CV imaging at follow up. [53][,][54][,][92] Cardiac serum biomarkers (NP and cTn) are useful given their high negative predictive
value for future CV events. [197][,][631] In a prospective study of 2625 adult
patients with cancer that assessed LVEF after anthracycline-based
chemotherapy, the overall incidence of CTRCD was 9%; 98% of
cases could be detected within 12 months after chemotherapy and
the median time from chemotherapy to CTRCD detection was

–
3.5 months (interquartile range 3 6 months). [208] The response to

ACE-I treatment declined when the interval between the end of

chemotherapy and CTRCD detection lengthened; complete LVEF
recovery was not observed in patients where treatment was delayed
by .6 months. [425]

Measurement of cTn after completion of anthracycline chemotherapy during the end-of-treatment assessment should be considered. Rises in cTnI after anthracycline chemotherapy identify
patients at risk of future cardiac dysfunction who then benefit
from CV protection. [4] Educating patients with cancer of their potential increased CVD risk and supporting them to make appropriate
healthy lifestyle choices is recommended. CS should also be advised
to promptly report early signs and symptoms of possible CVD and
inform medical teams of their previous cardiotoxic cancer therapies.
CVRF including hypertension, DM, and dyslipidaemia correlate with
the probability of future CV events in CS and should be well controlled after completion of cancer therapy. [31][,][632][,][633]

7.2. Which cancer survivors require
cardiovascular surveillance in the first
year after cancer treatment?
The end-of-treatment risk assessment ideally identifies those high-risk
CS, who require long-term CV surveillance, based on the following
criteria (Table 10):

(1) Baseline high or very high risk based on HFA-ICOS risk assessment tools [12] (Section 4).
(2) Cardiotoxic cancer therapy with a high risk of long-term CV
complications [7][,][21] (Section 8).
(3) Moderate or severe CTR-CVT diagnosed during cancer treatment (Table 3). [68]

(4) New abnormalities in cardiac function detected by echocardiography, new elevated cardiac serum biomarkers, or newly CV
symptoms detected at the end-of-therapy assessment (3 or 12
months after treatment). [68][,][208]

The timing of the first CV assessment after cardiotoxic cancer
treatment depends on the risk defined by baseline CV assessment,
the type of cancer therapy, and whether CTR-CVT was diagnosed
during treatment.
In asymptomatic high-risk patients (Table 10), echocardiography

and cardiac serum biomarkers are recommended at 3 and 12 months
after completion of cancer therapy. [53][,][54][,][59][,][61][,][68][,][148][,][208][,][425] In

a RT risk categorization based on MHD is recommended over categorization based on
prescribed dose, which may not accurately reflect cardiac radiation exposure.
Depending on dose distribution and exposure of specific cardiac substructures (as
well as clinical risk factors), the treatment team may judge the patient to belong to a
higher risk category. In addition, a patient may be judged to belong to a lower risk
category if only a small part of the heart is exposed to a relatively high prescribed
dose (i.e. RT to left breast or left chest wall only).

irradiation, alkylating agents); development of GVHD.

asymptomatic moderate-risk patients (according to CV toxicity
baseline risk stratification), echocardiography and cardiac serum biomarkers should be considered within 12 months after completion of
cancer therapy. [53][,][54][,][59][,][61][,][68][,][148][,][208] In asymptomatic low-risk patients
(according to CV toxicity baseline risk stratification), echocardiography and cardiac serum biomarkers may be considered within 12
months after completion of cancer therapy. [634]

All patients started on CV therapies (ACE-I/ARB/angiotensin
receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors, antihypertensive medications, antiarrhythmic medications, antiplatelet
therapies, statins) for any CTR-CVT (especially CTRCD) should
have a clinical assessment, ECG, echocardiography, and cardiac serum biomarkers (if LV systolic dysfunction/HF is a potential risk) at 3,
6, and 12 months after completing cancer treatment. A MDT-based
approach to palliative and end-of-life care for patients with cancer
with HF or other CTR-CVT should be focused on symptom relief
according to general ESC Guidelines.


7.3. Management of cancer
therapy-related cardiac dysfunction at
the end-of-therapy assessment
During this end-of-treatment assessment, a review of cardioprotective medications initiated during cancer therapy to treat CTRCD is
recommended (Figure 37). In selected patients with asymptomatic
mild or moderate CTRCD who have fully recovered with normal
TTE and cardiac serum biomarkers, a trial of weaning off CV

medication should be considered after MDT discussion. This is

most common after asymptomatic mild or moderate CTRCD secondary to trastuzumab, particularly in younger otherwise healthy
HER2+ BC survivors with no exposure to anthracycline chemotherapy. Further assessment of cardiac function with TTE and cardiac
serum biomarkers is recommended following withdrawal of CV
medication in patients with previous CTRCD to ensure cardiac func
tion remains normal.

Continuing long-term CV medication is generally recommended
in patients with moderate and severe symptomatic or severe asymptomatic CTRCD due to the high rate of recurrent HF. Long-term

treatment is also recommended in CS with mild or moderate

CTRCD who fail to recover normal LV function at their

end-of-therapy assessment (Figure 37).

7.4. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
and fitness during the end-of-therapy
assessment

CRF impairment is a strong predictor of patient outcome following
cancer treatment and an intervention target in CS. Low CRF is associated with poor quality of life, increased morbidity, reduced exercise
cardiac function and worse CVD risk profile, and is a robust independent predictor of all-cause, cancer-related, and CVD-related
mortality in CS. [119][,][120] Recent evidence suggests the risk of
CVD-related mortality in CS decreases by 14% per 1 metabolic
equivalent (3.5 mL O 2 /kg/min) increase in CRF. [120]

CPET may be considered for CS with exertional limitation, who
may have substantial benefit from cardiac rehabilitation. Eligible patients include those treated with higher doses of anthracycline
chemotherapy and/or RT to a volume including the heart, high CV
toxicity risk at baseline, patients who developed CTRCD during cancer therapy, and those identified with new abnormalities in LV function at their end-of-therapy assessment. [11] CPET can be an objective
tool in the diagnosis of decreased physical capacity and identify CV vs.
non-CV causes. [635]

7.5. The role of cardiac rehabilitation

Exercise is a potent multitargeted therapy that prevents and
treats multiple competing mechanisms of CTR-CVT in CS, including CRF impairment, [636] CV injury, and pre-existing and new
CVRF. [137] Prescribing exercise facilitates the delivery of therapeutic exercise that is individualized to a person’s fitness level and systematically progressed to optimize physiological adaptation. [637]

Current evidence demonstrates that supervised exercise therapy
(including high-intensity interval training [HIIT]) is safe and well
tolerated, [638] attenuates CTR-CVT risk, and improves CRF.
Furthermore, HIIT reduces CVRF [460] and CV risk [639] in patients

#### 8. Long-term follow-up and chronic cardiovascular complications in cancer survivors

8.1. Cancer survivors

8.1.1. Adult survivors of childhood and adolescent

cancer

The survival of children and adolescents with cancer has increased

considerably in recent decades, with 5-year survival rates currently
exceeding 80%. [647] However, the long-term health effects in the
growing population of childhood and adolescent CS are a major concern. [648] CTR-CVT, as a consequence of treatment with anthracy
clines, mitoxantrone, and/or chest-directed RT can manifest as

CTRCD but also as VHD, CAD, arrhythmias, autonomic dysfunction, pericardial disease, and premature CV mortality, depending
on the type of cardiotoxic treatment. [643][,][649]

CTRCD is one of the most frequent late effects in childhood CS
who received cardiotoxic cancer treatment and contributes to significant morbidity and non-cancer-related mortality later in life. [650]

The cumulative incidence of CTRCD varies depending on the diagnostic criteria applied and the population studied and ranges from
4.8% to 10.6% at 40–45 years of age. [651] RT to a field involving the

heart increases the risk of CTRCD and valvular and vascular
complications. [652]

Follow-up of paediatric CS according to the International Late
Effects of Childhood Cancer Guideline Harmonization Group is recommended. [653] This includes risk stratification based upon the total
cumulative dose of anthracycline chemotherapy and MHD delivered
(Table 11). Annual review of CVRF and education to promote a
healthy lifestyle is recommended. The frequency of CV review
with TTE depends upon risk. A CV review should be considered
every 5 years for moderate-risk childhood and adolescent adult CS
and every 2 years for high-risk childhood and adolescent adult CS.
A recent retrospective analysis has shown that quantification of
LVEF .5 years after cancer diagnosis improves long-term childhood

8.1.2. Adult cancer survivors

Long-term cancer survivorship care is an advancing field of research.
Many survivors will experience several cancer- and treatment-related
late effects throughout their lives, including CTR-CVT. Besides affecting their physical and psychosocial health status, these might reduce
life expectancy and quality of life. This is relevant in some cancer types,
when CVD risk—especially CTRCD risk—exceeds cancer mortality. [658][,][659] The risk of fatal heart disease is increased more than twofold in survivors of several solid cancers and lymphoma compared
with the general population. [660][–][662]

CV risk assessment at the end of therapy (Section 7) identifies CS
who require long-term cardiology follow-up beyond the first 12
months after completing their cancer treatment. Asymptomatic
CS with new or persisting abnormalities at their end-of-therapy assessment will be identified as at high risk for future CV events and
require long-term surveillance.
Specific cancer treatments carry the highest risk of long-term CV
toxicity including anthracycline chemotherapy and RT where the
heart is within the RT treatment volume. Progressive RT-related

–
CV toxicity typically develops 5 10 years after the initial treatment,
and may cause CAD and HF at an incidence up to six-fold higher than
in the general population. An increased CV mortality compared with
the general population has been attributed to radiation-associated
heart disease in Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, BC,
and patients with lung cancer. [663][–][665] The incidence and progression
of the radiation-related CV complications depends on the dose to
the CV tissue and on concomitant cancer therapies and patient characteristics, such as pre-existing CVD, CVRF, and age. [389][,][400]

Late CV complications are also observed in CS who required HSCT.
The incidence of HF increases up to 14.5% in women 15 years after
HSCT. Risk factors for CVD following HSCT include age, anthracycline
dose, chest radiation exposure, hypertension, DM, and smoking. [666]

Long-term follow-up surveillance, based on CV toxicity risks
(Table 12), includes patient education and CVRF optimization. An an
nual clinical CV risk assessment is recommended for all adult CS to

optimize CVRF control, promote a healthy lifestyle, and symptom review. This can be done in collaboration with primary care or a

4314 ESC Guidelines

a RT risk categorization based on MHD is recommended over categorization based on

Depending on dose distribution and exposure of specific cardiac substructures (as well
as clinical risk factors), the treatment team may judge the patient to belong to a higher
risk category. In addition, a patient may be judged to belong to a lower risk category in
case only a small part of the heart is exposed to a relatively high prescribed dose.

specialist in CV medicine with expertise in CVRF management. CS at
high or very high risk of future CVD can be divided into those at high
early risk (within 5 years of completing cancer therapy) and those at
high late risk (.30 years from completing treatment). The timing and
frequency of other complementary tests depends upon the risk for
CTR-CVT (Figure 38).
CS with a high or very high baseline risk and patients with abnormal
LV function at the end-of-therapy assessment have a high or very high


early risk, particularly in the first 2 years. [61][,][667][,][668] Annual CV assess
ment with clinical examination, ECG, and NP measurement is recom
mended in CS. TTE should be considered at years 1, 3, and 5 after
completion of cardiotoxic cancer therapy and every 5 years thereafter
in asymptomatic very high- and early high-risk adult CS.
In adult CS with late high CTR-CVT risk (e.g. young adults with
Hodgkin lymphoma or sarcomas who received a high total cumulative anthracycline dose or patients treated with high-dose radiation
to a field involving the heart, e.g. Mantle RT) there is a progressive
risk of CTRCD. [661][,][669] Annual CV assessment with clinical examin
ation, ECG, and NP measurement is recommended, starting 5 years
after the end of treatment, provided the end-of-therapy assessment
at 12 months is normal. TTE should also be considered every 5 years,
as well as non-invasive screening for CAD (Section 8.3) and carotid
disease (Section 8.5) according to local protocols. [670]

The long-term effects of CTRCD caused by trastuzumab and
other targeted cancer therapies (e.g. TKI) beyond 10 years are unknown. Currently, there is no recommendation for lifelong surveillance in these CS unless they have another indication.
CV assessment with clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography,
and NP measurement every 5 years should be considered in asymp
tomatic adult CS at moderate risk of future CTR-CVT and a normal

end-of-therapy CV assessment.

8.3. Coronary artery disease
Any vascular location within the RT treatment volume is at increased
risk for both accelerated atherosclerosis and RT-related vasculopathy. [173][,][392] RT to the chest (e.g. treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma,
early-stage BC, lung and oesophageal cancer, and for some patients
receiving infradiaphragmatic irradiation if the apex of the heart is
within the treatment volume) increases the risk of CAD. The latency
between RT and the appearance of CAD varies from a few years to
several decades, depending upon the presence or absence of preexisting atherosclerosis and the age of the patient at the time of
RT. This is a serious complication for young CS with a good prognosis and long-life expectancy (e.g. BC and Hodgkin lymphoma). [389][,][390]

Patients treated for mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma have shown an
increased risk of CAD as a first cardiac event. [400] RT-induced CAD
depends on the location of the RT treatment volume and most commonly affects either the proximal left anterior descending or the
right coronary arteries. RT-related vasculopathy is progressive and
typically manifests in severe, diffuse, long, smooth and concentric
angiographic lesions. [679][,][680]

The risk and severity of CAD increases with radiation dose, larger
volume exposed, younger age at time of treatment (,25 years), [390]

time from treatment, smoking, [400] the presence of other typical
CVRF, type of radiation source, and concurrent metabolic risk
factors. [493] RT accelerates pre-existing atherosclerosis leading to increased ACS risk within 10 years of treatment. [681]

Patients with RT-induced CAD undergoing PCI with bare-metal
stent or balloon angioplasty have an increased risk of all-cause and
CV mortality. [682] Conversely, after PCI with a drug-eluting stent,
there is no difference in target lesion revascularization or cardiac
mortality between patients with and without prior chest RT. [683]

Surgical revascularization in patients with prior RT may be complicated by poor tissue healing (skin and sternum), RT-induced injury to
the left and right internal mammary arteries (LIMA and RIMA, respectively), inadequate target coronary vessels, and increased
sternotomy-related pain. [684] Pre-operative assessment of internal


mammary artery viability, venous access, and sternal wound healing

is recommended in CS with RT-induced CAD where CABG is con
sidered. PCI with drug-eluting stents may be considered over CABG

in CS with RT-induced severe left main or three-vessel disease, with a

high SYNTAX (SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXus and cardiac surgery) score (.22), in whom the
planned PCI is technically feasible given the increased complications

associated with CABG after mediastinal RT.

Screening for CAD should be considered in high-risk patients who
have received chest RT to a treatment volume including the heart.
Screening should take the form of functional imaging and/or CCTA beginning at 5 years post-RT. [234][,][484] The natural history of RT-related vasculopathy is different to atherosclerosis and may accelerate rapidly. [173]

Functional cardiac imaging should be considered in asymptomatic CS
with pre-existing CAD or when new significant CAD is detected on
anatomical imaging. In asymptomatic patients with inducible ischaemia
secondary to RT-induced CAD, a MDT is recommended to discuss revascularization needs according to the location of the RT-induced CAD,
the ischaemia burden, LV function, arrhythmia burden, time since treatment, time since previous normal review (if available), concomitant
valvular disease, risks of surgical or percutaneous revascularization,
medical options, and patient preference. [173]

Platinum-based chemotherapies are now recognized to cause
CAD in CS. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy for testicular cancer is
associated with a 1.5–7-fold increased risk of developing
CAD. [421][,][493][,][685] Testicular CS who received platinum-based chemotherapy should have their CVRF tightly controlled and be educated
to report any new chest pain or cardiac symptoms to their doctor
promptly. The role of screening for CAD in patients who received
platinum-based chemotherapy is unknown.
Aggressive risk-factor modification and CV diagnostic work-up
strongly enhance survival. [5][,][672] Medical therapy with aspirin and statins for primary/secondary prevention, and beta-blockers and nitrates for symptom control, are recommended in CS. [686][,][687]

8.4. Valvular heart disease

VHD can appear in CS at any point in time but typically occurs
10 or more years after cancer treatment. [691] Chest RT is the
main risk factor in CS, in particular at higher dose ranges, which
can cause either stenosis or regurgitation, or both. [391]

The reported incidences of valvular regurgitation are up to
40% of CS survivors who received high-dose chest RT to a volume involving the heart, with,10% presenting with clinically
significant VHD. [670]

Prognosis and management depend on the extent and severity of
VHD, as it does in patients without cancer. [692] TAVI should be considered for patients with symptomatic RT-induced severe aortic
stenosis at intermediate surgical risk. [504][,][506][,][693][,][694] Similar strategies
with percutaneous mitral valve repair or replacement can be considered. [695] Importantly, commonly used calculators such STS PROM

–
(Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality) or
EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk
Evaluation) II [507] may underestimate the surgery-related risk in CS,
and especially those who develop RT-induced VHD, due to additional RT-related risk factors such as pericardial calcification, aortic calcification, increased bleeding risk, impaired skin healing, and RT-related
pulmonary fibrosis. A Heart Team with cardiac surgeons, interventional cardiologists, and cardio-oncology specialists should review
each case to guide appropriate treatment. The Heart Team recommendation should be discussed with the patient, who can then make

an informed treatment choice.

8.5. Peripheral artery disease and stroke
Peripheral arterial and cerebrovascular disease in CS can be due to
the continuum of vascular disease pre-existing before, or developing
during or after cancer therapy. Cancer therapies such as cisplatin,
BCR-ABL inhibitors, and RT can have a direct long-lasting effect on
the vasculature. Approximately 30% of CML patients on nilotinib

–
may develop PAD, which is clinically recognized 2 4 years after
the start of therapy. [698] The disease process may progress even after
discontinuation of nilotinib. Long-term vascular effects, generally associated with vascular reactivity, can also be seen in patients treated
with ponatinib, cisplatin, and bleomycin. [699][,][700] Accelerated vascular
aging, inflammation, fibrosis, and atherosclerosis are characteristic

                                         consequences of RT. [701] Up to 30% of patients may develop signifi
cant carotid artery stenoses (.70%) after head/neck radiation. [702][,][703]

Vascular disease can also be an indirect consequence of cancer and
its therapy, e.g. via reduction in physical activity, hyperlipidaemia, DM,
obesity, hypothyroidism, and/or kidney disease. These CVRF-related
effects are mostly additive to the direct treatment-related effects.
Promoting vascular health and preventing vascular disease in CS is recommended. [672] This should be in line with the 2021 ESC Guidelines
on CVD prevention in clinical practice. [19]

8.6. Pericardial complications
The risk of long-term pericardial complications after cancer
drug-induced acute pericarditis, caused by anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and bleomycin, is unknown but generally considered low. Long-term dasatinib treatment may lead to pericardial
effusion and pericarditis. The incidence of long-term ICI-associated
pericardial complications is low. [10]

RT-induced chronic pericardial diseases can appear months to
decades after the initial RT and constrictive pericarditis is the most
serious. [173][,][392] Incidence is difficult to determine, and many cases
are initially asymptomatic. [704] Five-yearly echocardiographic surveillance for pericardial constriction in CS following RT-induced acute
pericarditis may be considered. The absolute risk is considerably reduced with modern radiation protocols, [704] but a high rate of pericardial effusion has still been reported in patients with lung (grade ≥ 2,
.40% [705] ) and oesophageal cancer (.25% [706] ) treated with RT.
Pericardial disease has been less investigated than other
RT-induced CVD, and clear protocols for post-therapy surveillance
are lacking. [707][,][708] In CS with chronic pericardial effusions following
RT, cardiac imaging can assess for evidence of inflammation,

4318 ESC Guidelines


constriction, or tamponade. [709] Percutaneous balloon pericardiotomy or pericardial window creation should be used in selected cases
for large or growing chronic effusions if haemodynamic compromise
develops. Management of these conditions should follow general
guideline recommendations. [14][,][444]

8.7. Arrhythmias and autonomic disease
Arrhythmias, conduction disease, and autonomic disease are common complications in CS. Conduction disease after thoracic RT is
typically associated with other CTR-CVT. [710] It may include AV
block, bundle branch block, and sick sinus syndrome that should
be monitored and treated according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines
on cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy. [443]

Patients who require valve replacement after thoracic RT have a
high risk of post-operative AV block requiring permanent pacemaker therapy. [711] Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias
are more common in patients after thoracic RT, [712] possibly due
to RT-induced myocardial fibrosis. A common long-term complication after HSCT is supraventricular arrhythmia including AF and atrial flutter, [457] particularly in CS treated with anthracyclines or with
new CVRF or CV toxicity.
Autonomic dysfunction is an emerging but poorly understood
complication observed in CS, and is most frequently observed as a
late complication after thoracic RT. Orthostatic hypotension, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and loss of circadian heart rate variability can occur. [713][,][714]

Physicians caring for these patients should consider referral for autonomic evaluation. In addition, the perception of angina pain may be
impaired, [714] making the diagnosis of post-radiation CAD challenging.
Evidence-based pharmacological treatment strategies are based on
studies of patients with other autonomic dysfunction aetiologies
(e.g. DM or infiltrative diseases) and the reported effectiveness is
generally poor. [714]

8.8. Metabolic syndrome, lipid
abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, and
hypertension
There is a growing understanding about shared CVRF that may be
responsible for cancer development or progression and premature
CV morbi-mortality. [34] Modifiable CVRF continue to be underdiagnosed and undertreated in CS, especially hypertension, [715] obesity,
DM, metabolic syndrome, [716] and dyslipidaemia. Early diagnosis via


standardized risk-based screening and management of these conditions according to general ESC Guidelines is recommended [19] to improve long-term outcomes in CS. [672]

Increasing numbers of patients with cancer are already overweight
or obese at cancer diagnosis, [717] and additional weight gain is a frequent complication of anticancer treatments. [718] Obesity is associated with metabolic syndrome, worsening CVRF, and cancer.
Increasing evidence indicates that being overweight increases the

risk of cancer recurrence and reduces the likelihood of disease-free
survival and overall survival among those diagnosed with cancer. [719][–]

724 There is also growing evidence to support intentional weight loss
post-treatment in CS, which may result in improved prognosis and
survival. [719] Dietary patterns characterized by a high intake of vegetables/fruits and whole grains has been shown to be associated with reduced mortality and cancer recurrence when compared with a high
intake of refined grains, processed and red meats, and high-fat dairy
products. [725][–][727]

The identification and treatment of hyperlipidaemia in CS is associated with a profound impact on outcomes. [182][,][183] There is a benefit
for CS from an all-cause mortality perspective as well as for decreasing cancer recurrence. [728][–][730]

Several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic benefits of exercise during primary anticancer treatment, [731][,][732] and exercise is recommended during and after anticancer treatment. [11][,][733] For CS, [734]

aerobic exercise results in improved survival. [735] Based on current
guidelines, patients undergoing anticancer therapy and long-term
CS should be encouraged to exercise for at least 150 min per
week. [736]

8.9. Pregnancy in cancer survivors
Improvements in the treatment of cancer have led to an increasing
number of female paediatric and adolescent CS who experience
pregnancy many years after their oncological treatments.
Approximately 60% of them will have been previously exposed to
anthracycline chemotherapy or chest RT and they have a 15-fold increase in their lifetime risk of developing HF. [737] As young CS enter
their reproductive years and contemplate pregnancy, it is important
to understand the impact of cancer and its treatment on fertility,
pregnancy outcomes, and CV health. There are limited data available
regarding CV risk in pregnancy following cancer treatments. The
overall incidence of LVD or HF associated with pregnancy in female
adult CS varies according to the studied population. In a single institution report including 337 female CS treated with cardiotoxic therapies, 58 (17%) had a subsequent pregnancy. [738] Cardiac events,
defined as LVEF, 50% on two TTE or new CAD, were identified
in 17 patients. [738] Patients with cardiac events were likely to be
younger at cancer diagnosis, received a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline, and had a longer delay (in years) from cancer treatment
to first pregnancy compared with pregnant women with no cardiac
event. [738] In a recent meta-analysis of six studies, the weighted risk of
pregnancy-associated LVD or HF in CS treated with anthracyclines
was 1.7% with no reported maternal cardiac deaths. [739] Major risk
factors for CV events during pregnancy in CS include CTRCD (incidence 28%; 47.4-fold higher odds), [739] younger age at cancer diagnosis, [738][,][740] longer time from cancer treatment to first pregnancy, and
cumulative anthracycline dose. [738]

ESC Guidelines 4319


Management by an expert MDT (the pregnancy heart team) is recommended for all CS with CTRCD who are considering pregnancy. [739][,][741][,][742] The risk of HF in CS without CTRCD is low,
although vigilance remains important for potential maternal cardiac
complications.

8.10. Pulmonary hypertension
Long-term clinical evaluation may be considered in patients who develop PH during therapy (Section 6). In patients with new exertional
dyspnoea, fatigue, or angina, a TTE is recommended to assess the
probability of PH. As TTE alone is not enough to confirm the diagnosis
of PH, CS diagnosed with high PH probability require a right-heart
catheterization to confirm the diagnosis. PH should be treated according to general guidelines with referral to a specialist PH service. [620]
#### 9. Special populations

9.1. Cardiac tumours
Cardiac tumours are classified as either benign or malignant. [743] Over
90% of primary cardiac tumours are benign (myxomas are


predominant in adults, rhabdomyomas in children). [744] Malignant primary tumours most commonly consist of sarcomas (approximately
65%) or lymphomas (approximately 25%). [745] Cardiac metastases
(from melanoma, lymphoma, leukaemia, breast, lung, and oesophageal cancers) are much more common than primary cardiac tumours
(Figure 39). [746] Presenting symptoms are paraneoplastic (fever, weakness, fatigue), thromboembolic, haemodynamic (due to compression
or obstruction from the tumour) or arrhythmic. [747][,][748]

The diagnostic pathway should be based on knowledge about
tumour type epidemiology, imaging features, and usually the
requirement for a histopathological diagnosis. This topic has been
extensively reviewed in ESC CardioMed, [749] and here we
summarize the main recommendations for differential diagnosis
and management. Differential diagnosis should exclude cardiac
thrombi or the presence of chemotherapy catheters. Imaging must
assess the possibilities of cardiac surgery, and may include: (1) echocardiography (initial approach using TTE or transoesophageal
echocardiography) [748][,][750] ; (2) CMR (for cardiac tumour tissue characterization) [751][,][752] ; and (3) CT and PET (to distinguish malignant
from benign lesions and assess for non-cardiac metastatic disease
or primary cancers) (Figure 40). [753][,][754]

Myxomas are primarily treated with surgery with a good prognosis. Malignant tumours are associated with a poor prognosis and evidence of the best treatment is lacking. Complete surgical resection is
often impossible and adjuvant RT, systemic chemotherapy, and/or
debulking palliative surgery are needed. [755] Cardiac aggressive B-cell
lymphomas require histopathological diagnosis (often obtained via
analysis of pericardial effusion, EMB, or direct surgical biopsy) and
are treated with chemotherapy, possibly followed by RT
(Table 13). [756]

9.2. Pregnant patients with cancer
The diagnosis of cancer during pregnancy is uncommon (1 in every
1000 pregnant women is diagnosed with cancer), with BC, melanoma, and cervical cancer being the most frequent diagnoses. [757]

Chemotherapy is generally not applied during the first trimester
due to the high risk of foetal congenital abnormalities (up to 20%)
and cytotoxic chemotherapies have different risk profiles during
the second or third trimesters. [758][,][759] Furthermore, chemotherapy
administration is usually not given beyond week 34 of gestation to
provide a 3-week window between the last cycle and delivery. [757]

[Supplementary data, Table S19 summarizes the chemotherapies](http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehac244#supplementary-data)
for pregnant patients with cancer. [760][,][761]

Cardiac assessment prior to chemotherapy in pregnant women
with cancer should consist of clinical history, physical examination,
ECG, cardiac biomarker assessment and TTE (Figure 41). [741]

Baseline and follow-up TTE should be interpreted in the context
of physiological haemodynamic alterations during pregnancy. In normal pregnancy, increase in stroke volume, heart rate, and pre-load
blood volume, and decrease in systemic vascular resistance, lead to
an increase in cardiac output from the first trimester to 80–85%
above baseline by the third trimester. [762][–][764] An increase in LV

mass and LV and RV volumes is observed in the third trimester.

During normal pregnancy, LVEF is usually unchanged and can be
used for CTRCD monitoring. Although NP and cTn may be slightly
elevated during normal pregnancy (NT-proBNP, 300 ng/L, BNP,
100 pg/mL, [14] and hs-cTnT [765][,][766] ), serial evaluation may be useful for

cut-off NP levels for pregnancy.
The topic of CVD during pregnancy has been extensively reviewed in the 2018 ESC Guidelines for the management of CVD
during pregnancy. [741] Here we focus on specific recommendations
in pregnant women with cancer receiving anthracycline
chemotherapy.

9.2.1. Left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure
Medical history evaluating signs and symptoms of HF should be performed at every clinical visit of pregnant women with cancer receiving anthracycline chemotherapy. More frequent CV evaluations with


TTE during treatments with potential CTRCD risk should be advised

–
(e.g. every 4 8 weeks or every two cycles for a 3-weekly anthracycline
chemotherapy cycle). The management of clinical HF or asymptomatic
LVD during pregnancy is fully described in the 2018 ESC Guidelines for
the management of CVD during pregnancy. [741]

9.2.2. Venous thromboembolism and pulmonary
embolism

Pregnant patients with cancer have an increased risk of
developing VTE, especially when hospitalized. [767][–][769]

Identified risks for VTE in pregnant patients include having a
history of BC or previous chemotherapy in the past 6 months.

Determination of VTE risk score and the use of thrombo
prophylaxis protocols may be useful to prevent maternal


morbidity and/or mortality due to VTE. [770] LMWH have become the drug of choice for the prophylaxis and treatment
of VTE in pregnant patients. [741] The recommendation for
thromboprophylaxis should be individualized, weighing the
risks of bleeding vs. thromboembolism in pregnant patients

with cancer.

9.3. Carcinoid valvular heart disease

Carcinoid tumours represent rare neuroendocrine malignancies originating from the enterochromaffin cells (Figure 42). [771] Carcinoid
syndrome is a rare cause of acquired VHD including mainly rightsided valvular lesions, but also left-sided involvement, pericardial effusion, and myocardial metastases. [772] Coronary artery vasospasm
and paroxysmal atrial or ventricular tachycardias may rarely occur
due to sympathetic stimulation. Cardiac metastases are reported
with an incidence of 3.8% on the ventricles, confirmed by PET-CT
scans. [773][,][774] Data from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results) registry identified that approximately 20% of patients
with neuroendocrine malignancies develop carcinoid syndrome

–
(7.6 32.4%), which is associated with shorter survival (4.7 years
compared with 7.1 years in patients without carcinoid syndrome)
and poor quality of life. [775] It is estimated that 20–50% of these patients present cardiac involvement, especially of the right-sided cardiac valves. [771] In the presence of a patent foramen ovale, interatrial
shunt, primary bronchial neuroendocrine tumour, or extensive liver
metastases, humoral substances directly enter the systemic circulation, causing left-sided valvular involvement in up to one-third of
cases. [776]

NP should be considered for screening and surveillance of patients

at risk of carcinoid cardiac involvement and TTE is recommended in

patients with NT-proBNP . 260 pg/mL or clinical signs or symptoms. [777][–][780] In asymptomatic patients with NT-proBNP, 260 pg/
mL, repeat clinical and NP assessment should be considered every

6 months.

Survival has improved in carcinoid tumours, with the use of somatostatin analogues and surgical techniques in liver metastasis.
However, right HF still represents a major cause of death. [781][,][782]

Many patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation due to carcinoid


syndrome require both tricuspid and pulmonary valve surgery. [783]

Administration of i.v. somatostatin analogues (e.g. octreotide) is recommended to avoid a peri-operative carcinoid crisis. The infusion
should be started on the morning of the procedure (up to 12 h preoperatively), continued throughout the procedure (surgery, preoperative coronary angiography, pacemaker implantation), and postoperatively for at least 48 h following valve surgery or until stable if a
carcinoid crisis is triggered post-operatively. [772]

The optimal choice of valve prosthesis is still a matter of debate
due to the balance of risk of both accelerated bioprosthetic valve degeneration vs. bleeding risks in patients with extensive liver metastases requiring therapeutic anticoagulation for mechanical valves. [784][,][785]

Complications include AV block, requiring pacemaker implantation
in 25% of patients. [786] Frequently, the reduced RV function does
not improve despite tricuspid valve replacement and HF persists. [787]

Thrombus formation on the tricuspid bioprosthesis can occur, especially during the first 3 months post-operatively, and oral anticoagulation with VKA may be considered. Persistent serotonin elevation
can cause recurrent bioprosthesis valve fibrosis. Valve-in-valve transcatheter intervention has been reported in bioprosthetic valve failure

in metastatic carcinoid heart disease; however, future research is
needed to define its role. [783][,][788][,][789]

In patients with left-sided carcinoid valvular involvement, closure
of interatrial shunts should be considered, although only sparse
data exist for this approach.

9.4. Amyloid light-chain cardiac
amyloidosis
Amyloid light-chain amyloidosis is a plasma cell dyscrasia, which
is typically treated with therapies very similar to those used in
MM, including PI-based therapy. [792] It can occur in conjunction
with myeloma or independently as a light-chain proteinproducing disorder. Amyloid light-chain amyloidosis is a systemic
disease [793][,][794] and it is critical to have a high degree of suspicion for
the diagnosis of cardiac involvement (amyloid light-chain cardiac
amyloidosis [AL-CA]) because a combination of specialized tests
is needed to make an accurate diagnosis (Figure 43). [290][,][793][,][795][,][796]

4326 ESC Guidelines


Cardiac serum biomarkers are an essential step in the diagnostic
and prognostic assessments for these patients. [797][–][799] AL-CA has
been extensively reviewed in a recent position paper from the
Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases. [290]

The classical non-invasive definition of AL-CA is based on clinical
suspicion, biomarkers, TTE, CMR, and nuclear scintigraphy criteria
(Figure 43). Persistent troponin elevation and disproportionately
high NT-proBNP (generally .300 ng/L in the absence of renal failure or AF) to ventricular function parameters on TTE is a characteristic red flag for AL-CA. [800] A decrease in GLS with a
distinctive apical sparing pattern (preserved GLS values in the LV
apical region) is considered specific for cardiac amyloidosis, although it is not helpful to distinguish between amyloid light-chain
and transthyretin amyloidosis. [801] Additionally, GLS ≥−15% may
serve as an independent prognostic factor of poor overall survival
in patients with AL-CA. [802] CMR with LGE and parametric imaging
has emerged as a new non-invasive gold-standard for diagnosis
(Figure 43). [803][,][804] Nuclear scintigraphy can differentiate transthyretin amyloidosis from AL-CA supported by the presence of monoclonal protein. [290] EMB should be considered in patients with
suspected AL-CA involvement if CMR is not diagnostic. [290] A rare
condition that may coexist with AL-CA is light-chain deposition disease, which frequently associates extensive renal involvement and
poor prognosis. [799]

Recently, a staging system for AL-CA has demonstrated the prognostic impact of cTnT and NT-proBNP levels. [797] Heart progression
criteria are defined by NT-proBNP progression (.30% and
.300 ng/L increase), cTnT progression (≥33% increase) or ejection
fraction decrease (≥10% decrease). [805][–][807] However, evaluating a
cardiac response to treatment using a decrease in NT-proBNP levels
and New York Heart Association class improvement is still
challenging.
AL-CA frequently results in HF, major cardiac arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, sudden cardiac death, and an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis. [808][–][810] Beta-blockers, ACE-I, ARB, or

angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor may not be well tolerated
because of hypotension. [290] The management of AF is very complex
in this population. Amiodarone is the preferred antiarrhythmic treatment and digitalis should be used with caution. Anticoagulation is recommended in all AL-CA patients with AF independent of the
CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score due to the high prothrombotic risk unless
there is a contraindication. [290] Currently, the guidelines for implanted
devices, including pacemakers and ICDs, do not provide specific re
commendations for AL-CA and decisions should be individualized
after a MDT discussion. [811]

Optimal systemic therapy for AL-CA is rapidly changing, and the
efficacy of certain combination therapies continues to improve. [812][,][813] Autologous HSCT for AL-CA is not universally utilized
but is a viable treatment option. [814] Therapies for AL-CA are evolving, and daratumumab and PI show promise for improved outcomes. [792][,][815][–][817] Clinical observations, but no RCT evidence,

suggest the potential role of doxycycline to improve survival in patients with AL-CA. [818][,][819]

9.5. Cardiac implantable electronic
devices

RT can cause malfunction of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). [443][,][823] The risk of RT-induced CIED malfunction
generally increases with the radiation dose, [824][,][825] although the
strongest predictor of malfunction is the magnitude of
exposure to neutron emission from high-energy photon RT, conventionally defined as a beam energy .10 megavolts (MV). [824][,][826][,][827]

Non-neutron-producing treatment is therefore preferable in patients with a CIED. [826]

RT-induced CIED malfunction can manifest in: (1) transient interference, with inappropriate triggering during the irradiation only; (2)
a reset, reverting to backup settings, recoverable with device reprogramming; and, rarely (3) permanent damage to the device due to
direct CIED irradiation. [826][,][827]

The clinical consequences of a CIED malfunction include the inhibition of pacing and inappropriate pacing at maximum sensor rate. [826]

The clinical effects of device malfunction are greatest when the patient is pacing-dependent. Theoretically, oversensing might lead to
inappropriate ICD shocks, although this has not been reported in
the literature. [826]

More recent registries have reported minimal or no adverse effects of RT on CIED malfunction. [827][,][828] Nevertheless, as it is not possible to predict the behaviour of a CIED within or close to an RT
treatment volume, general recommendations should be followed
to minimize patient risk (Figures 44–46). [188][,][824][,][825]

Patients with a CIED should be reviewed by their cardiologist/
electrophysiologist to assess the risk of CIED malfunction and

patients should be informed of the potential risks of RT. [443] For patients with rate-adaptive pacemakers, consideration should be given
to temporary deactivation of the sensor during RT. Although inactivation of antitachycardia therapies in patients with ICDs is recommended in several publications, by either reprogramming or
application of a magnet to ICDs, it is infrequently performed in clinical practice. [826]

CIEDs should not be placed directly in the RT treatment volume and the cumulative dose should not exceed 2 Gy to a pacemaker or 1 Gy to an ICD. [827] If the CIED is situated in the path
of the planned radiation beam, it could also interfere with


adequate tumour treatment. The photon beam energy should
be kept,10 MV as the risk of device malfunction/damage increases above this threshold. If higher doses are needed or if
the CIED cannot be kept out of the beam, consideration should
be given to removing and relocating the CIED away from the
beam, although this will only very rarely be necessary. The main
reason for device relocation is to allow adequate RT treatment
of the tumour, but consideration should also be given to possible
RT-induced CIED malfunction/damage with consequent need for
CIED replacement. [826] However, CIED explant and resiting carries
significant risks, including the risk of infection, which may be of

RT is interfering with CIED function (aim to not exceed 2 Gy to permanent pacemaker and 1 Gy to ICD); (3) risks of moving the CIED: infection (especially in immunocompromised patients), procedural complications (e.g. bleeding with thrombocytopaenia); for younger patients with good prognosis,

particular importance in patients receiving chemotherapy or
those who are immunosuppressed. For most patients in whom
definitive tumour treatment is planned, the risk/benefit ratio will
usually favour device relocation, whereas for patients receiving
palliative RT or with significant comorbidities, relocation could
be avoided. [826] These decisions should be made by a MDT in


conjunction with the patient. Device relocation is not recommended for CIEDs receiving a maximum cumulative incident
dose of,5 Gy, where the risk is considered negligible. [826][,][828]

There should be continuous visual and voice contact with the patient during each treatment fraction. CIEDs should be periodically
checked in patients with ICDs, especially those receiving .10 MV

photon beam energy. [827][,][829] For patients receiving electron or kV
photon beam RT, CIED evaluation appears largely unnecessary. [827]

For patients treated with proton beam RT, special consideration
should be paid to the neutron component of the beam, as the risk


of CIED reset is potentially significant. [824][,][830] The CIED should be rechecked within 2 weeks of completion of RT treatment. Systematic
remote CIED monitoring may be helpful to optimize the patient’s
surveillance. [831]

#### 10. Patient information, communication, and self-management

Collaboration between different healthcare professionals and patients is of paramount importance for the most effective management of patients with cancer and CVD. Appropriate language and
communication should be used to allow patients to receive clear
and accurate information about their condition, and play an active
role in managing their treatment. [11]

The first goal of this process is to raise the patient’s awareness of
the possible presence or development of a CVD, either during cancer or after having some oncological therapy. Patients should understand that cancer and CVD share many CVRF and reducing risk is
vital for the prevention of cancer, cancer relapse, and the development or worsening of a CVD during or after treatment. Patients
should be informed—at the end of chemotherapy—that a personalized follow-up plan and regular CV controls are needed to detect
potential reversible stages of CV toxicities. Education, counselling,
and support to promote healthy lifestyle and to treat modifiable

ESC Guidelines 4331


CVRF should be offered to patients with cancer, in order to reduce
the burden of complications during and after anticancer therapy.
Patients should receive guidance to recognize and to report signs
and symptoms of CVD, in order to receive prompt and effective treatment, ideally without interfering with their cancer treatment. Patients
should also be advised not to stop cardioprotective therapies without
medical guidance, even if they recover their cardiac function. To help
in this complex task, leaflets specifically designed for this context may
be used, [832][,][833] eventually with the aid of digital tools (Figure 47).
#### 11. The role of scientific societies in the promotion and development of cardio-oncology in modern medicine

Cardio-oncology is a subspecialty that has seen huge development and
growth in recent years with the formation—in almost all national and
international societies—of cardio-oncology working groups.


Moreover, cancer and medical associations have also developed an increasing interest in cardio-oncology. Important roles of these scientific
societies are clinical research, education, and advocacy. The ESC-CCO
strategic plan and mission include improvement of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management of CTR-CVT and enhancement of the
standard of care for patients with cancer (Figure 48).
#### 12. Key messages

This is the first ESC cardio-oncology Guideline and contains 272 new
recommendations. The key messages from this guideline are:

- A guiding principle of cardio-oncology is integration, and
cardio-oncology providers must have knowledge of the broad
scope of cardiology, oncology, and haematology. Communication
between different healthcare professionals is critical to optimize
the care of patients with cancer and CVD.

- Cardio-oncology programmes facilitate cancer treatment by minimizing unnecessary cancer therapy interruptions and CTR-CVT








Figure 48 The role of scientific societies in the promotion and development of cardio-oncology. CVD, cardiovascular disease.

4332 ESC Guidelines


across the entire continuum of cancer care. In patients who develop CTR-CVT, a MDT discussion is required to balance the
risk/benefit of cancer treatment discontinuation.

- There is a new international definition of CTR-CVT (Table 3).

- CV toxicity risk is a dynamic variable. This guideline is structured to
provide a personalized approach to care based upon the baseline
CV toxicity risk. A baseline CV risk assessment is recommended
for all patients with cancer scheduled to receive a potentially cardiotoxic anticancer therapy. This enables the oncology team to
consider CV risk while making cancer treatment choices, educating
patients regarding their CV risk, and personalizing CV surveillance
and follow-up strategy.

- Primary prevention of CV toxicity from cancer therapy aims to
avoid or minimize the development of CTR-CVT in patients with
out CVD.

- Secondary prevention refers to interventions in patients with preexisting CVD, including prior or new CTR-CVT. A MDT is recommended when patients with cancer have complex CVD that may
impact on their cancer treatment.

- Defining and delivering an appropriate prevention and surveillance
plan for potential CV complications is recommended. Optimal
management of CVRF and pre-existing CVD is mandatory to facilitate cancer therapy and to improve patients’ prognosis.

- —
Detailed monitoring pathways during cancer therapy including
3D echocardiography, GLS, and cardiac biomarkers—are provided to detect CV toxicity based upon specific cancer therapies
and baseline CV toxicity risk.

- Treatment recommendations for CTRCD during and after cancer
therapy depend upon CTRCD severity and symptoms. New guidance on continuing trastuzumab in BC patients who develop

–
asymptomatic moderate CTRCD (LVEF 40 49%) while starting
cardioprotective medication is provided.

- Use of a structured algorithm to guide decisions regarding anticoagulation management in patients with cancer presenting with AF
or VTE encompassing the TBIP assessment is encouraged.

- After cancer treatment is completed, the focus of the
cardio-oncology team shifts to coordination of long-term followup. This starts with an ‘end-of-treatment’ assessment in the first
year after treatment, reviewing patients with cancer who have received cardiotoxic anticancer therapies to reassess their CV toxicity risk and guide long-term surveillance planning.

- A new algorithm (Figure 37) is provided to guide weaning off of CV

medication in CS.

- Patients with cancer, CS, and the patient’s family/carers should receive guidance to promote healthy lifestyle and recognize and report signs and symptoms of CVD, to receive prompt and effective
treatment, without interfering with their cancer treatment.

- Patients must receive psychological support when needed and
clear and accurate information about their condition to play an active role in managing their treatment and increase adherence to

cancer and CV treatments.
#### 13. Future needs

There are a low number of dedicated cardio-oncology services and
most patients are reviewed in general cardiology clinics in Europe


and worldwide. Strategic investments in cardio-oncology care
networks and cardio-oncology services provision are needed to
meet the projected increased clinical demand in the near future, [834] and to facilitate research, training, and educational activities. A dedicated training core curriculum for a minimum of
1-year medical training is urgently needed. It may include: (1)
knowledge of the broad scope of cardiology, oncology, and
haematology; (2) CV competencies for CTR-CVT prevention,
surveillance, and management of patients with cancer in dedicated
outpatients’ cardio-oncology clinics; (3) inpatient consultative
services; and (4) dedicated time to achieve competences in CV imaging, HF, and vascular cardiology.
Collaboration between healthcare providers, clinical and basic investigators, healthcare authorities, regulatory bodies, advocacy
groups, and patients’ associations is needed to address future needs
(see Section 11).
As this Guideline was developed, it became clear that there is a significant lack of RCT to guide decision-making, with many recommendations supported by level of evidence C. This is complicated by the
fast-moving pace of new oncology treatment developments against a
background of dynamic CV toxicity likelihood. Therefore, large num
                                         bers of patients and longer follow-up are required to provide suffi
cient statistical power and definitive answers. In the future, the
following strategies and areas of research are priorities:

- New trial designs focusing upon the ‘at-risk’ cancer patient
populations.

- Validating current HFA-ICOS risk assessment tools and surveillance algorithms.

- Assessment of new technologies for the detection of early
CTRCD, broadening the biomarker panel and recognizing the specific patterns in early myocardial damage.

- Refining CV risk scores (e.g. EuroSCORE II, SCORE2,
SCORE2-OP, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc, HAS-BLED, SYNTAX) for application in cancer populations.

- Optimal treatment of steroid-resistant ICI CV toxicity and longterm CV effects of ICI therapy.

- Selection criteria for modern percutaneous structural (TAVI,
Mitraclip, LAA occluder devices) and electrophysiological (ablation) CV therapies in patients with active cancer.

Patient-specific predictive algorithms for QTc prolongation with
cancer drugs.

- Assessment of genetic profiles in more specific CTRCD risk
prediction.

- Identification of the cancer patient populations with mild or moderate CTRCD during treatment who can safely wean off long-term

CV medication.

- Optimal modalities for screening long-term survivor populations
for the complications of anthracycline chemotherapy and medias
tinal radiation.

- Creation of large cardio-oncology registries to collect ‘big data’ on
large patient populations.

Application of artificial intelligence and other new data analytics to
identify new patients with cancer at risk and new parameters that
can predict risk of CTR-CVT, response to specific cardioprotective interventions, and long-term risk and safety to wean off CV
therapies initiated during cancer treatment.

#### 14. Gaps in evidence

Cancer and CVD are the two major public health problems with great
economic and social impact. In addition, CTR-CVT are associated with
anexcessofbothCVandoncologicalmortality,especiallywhenthey limit
patients’ ability to complete effective treatments. However, the intersection of cancer and CVD has only recently gained wider interest and many

areas with lack of evidence need to be addressed in future research.

Role of cardio-oncology services and cardio-oncology

care networks

- Robust evidence on the impact of dedicated cardio-oncology programmes and cardio-oncology rehabilitation on the prognosis of
patients with cancer and survivors.

Specification of roles of different healthcare professionals (including nurses and pharmacists) in cardio-oncology teams.

- Cardio-oncology care networks to improve the management of
patients with cancer and to discuss difficult cases.

- Cardio-oncology team support and involvement in oncology trials
design (including patients’ representatives).

- Understand how to engage patients with cancer in their own CV
care (inclusion of digital tools).

Research, education, and training in cardio-oncology

Consensus about CV toxicity definitions used in oncology trials.

- Define standards for CV toxicity monitoring in oncology trials to
avoid unexpected CV toxicities when new drugs are approved for

clinical use.

- Relevant model systems to allow high-throughput screening of
new cancer treatments for CV toxicity.

- Improved knowledge on CV toxicity mechanisms of new targeted
cancer therapies and ICI and optimal treatment of CV toxicities.

- Improved knowledge on the effects of radiation to specific cardiac
substructures and the interactions between cardiotoxic systemic
therapy and RT.

- Further research into the underlying mechanisms that connect
CVD and cancer, such as a genetic predisposition to CV toxicity.



Personalized medicine and use of big data and artificial intelligence

tools.

Cardiovascular toxicity risk stratification

- Development of CV toxicity risk prediction tools including both
treatment- and patient-related risk factors.

- Validated prospective CV toxicity risk scores based on clinical

outcomes.

- Further research on the role of genetics in CV toxicity risk
stratification.

- Validation of CPET parameters for CV outcomes in patients with

cancer.

Prevention, diagnosis, and management of CTR-CVT

- Raise awareness of the benefits of minimizing CV risk in patients

with cancer in order to reduce the risk of CTR-CVT.

- More data on new technologies (biomarkers, advanced echocardiography, CMR, etc.) and genetic profiles for the detection of early
CV toxicity.

- Prospective studies showing the impact on outcomes and/or quality of life (and frailty) of early CTR-CVT diagnosis and treatment.

- Further evidence from prospective RCTs to define when cardioprotective medications improve patients’ outcomes.

- Further research on the potential for aerobic exercise to reduce

CTR-CVT.

- RCTs of (new) CV therapies in patients with different types of

CTR-CVT.

Long-term cancer survivorship programmes

- Development of optimal CV follow-up programmes after treatment for cancer (research on risk stratification, efficacy, and frequency of screening protocols).

- Best screening strategies for RT-induced CAD.

- Further research on CV preventive strategies for long-term CS.

#### 16. Quality indicators for cardio-oncology

Quality indicators (QIs) are tools that may be used to evaluate care
quality, including structural, process, and outcomes of care. [835] They
may also serve as a mechanism for enhancing adherence to guideline
recommendations, through associated quality improvement initiatives and the benchmarking of care providers. [836][,][837] As such, the
role of QIs in improving care and outcomes for CVD is increasingly
recognized by healthcare authorities, professional organizations,
payers, and the public. [835]

The ESC understands the need for measuring and reporting quality and outcomes of CV care and has established methods for the development of the ESC QIs for the quantification of care and
outcomes for CVD. [835] These methods were used to develop QIs
pertinent to cardio-oncology in parallel with the writing of this
Clinical Practice Guideline document and through the collaboration
with patient representatives and domain experts. The QIs, alongside
their measurement specifications and development process will be
published separately.
