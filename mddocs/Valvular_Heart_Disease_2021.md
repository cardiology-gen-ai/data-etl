responsible health professional(s) in consultation with the patient
and caregiver as appropriate.
A great number of guidelines have been issued in recent years by
the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and its partners such as
the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS), as
well as by other societies and organizations. Because of their impact
on clinical practice, quality criteria for the development of guidelines
have been established in order to make all decisions transparent to
the user. The recommendations for formulating and issuing ESC
[Guidelines can be found on the ESC website (https://www.escardio.](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
[org/Guidelines). The ESC Guidelines represent the official position of](https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines)
the ESC on a given topic and are regularly updated.

In addition to the publication of Clinical Practice Guidelines, the
ESC carries out the EURObservational Research Programme of
international registries of cardiovascular diseases and interventions
which are essential to assess diagnostic/therapeutic processes, use of
resources and adherence to guidelines. These registries aim at providing a better understanding of medical practice in Europe and
around the world, based on high-quality data collected during routine
clinical practice.
The Members of this Task Force were selected by the ESC and
EACTS, including representation from relevant ESC and EACTS subspecialty groups, in order to represent professionals involved with the
medical care of patients with this pathology. Selected experts in the
field undertook a comprehensive review of the published evidence for
management of a given condition according to ESC Clinical Practice
Guidelines Committee (CPG). A critical evaluation of diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures was performed, including assessment of the
risk�benefit ratio. The level of evidence and the strength of the recommendation of particular management options were weighed and
graded according to predefined scales, as outlined below.
The experts of the writing and reviewing panels provided declaration of interest forms for all relationships that might be perceived as . [....................................................................................................]

real or potential sources of conflicts of interest. Their declarations of
interest were reviewed according to the ESC declaration of interest
[rules and can be found on the ESC website (http://www.escardio.org/](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
[guidelines) and have been compiled in a report and published in a](http://www.escardio.org/guidelines)
supplementary document simultaneously to the guidelines.

This process ensures transparency and prevents potential biases in
the development and review processes. Any changes in declarations of
interest that arise during the writing period were notified to the ESC and
updated. The Task Force received its entire financial support from the
ESC and EACTS without any involvement fromthe healthcare industry.
The ESC CPG supervises and coordinates the preparation of new
guidelines. The Committee is also responsible for the endorsement
process of these guidelines. The ESC Guidelines undergo extensive
review by the CPG and external experts. After appropriate revisions
the guidelines are signed-off by all the experts involved in the Task
Force. The finalized document is signed-off by the CPG for publication in the European Heart Journal and the European Journal of
Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. The guidelines were developed after careful consideration of the scientific and medical knowledge and the evidence available at the time of their dating.
The task of developing ESC/EACTS Guidelines also includes the
creation of educational tools and implementation programmes for
the recommendations including condensed pocket guideline versions, summary slides, summary cards for non-specialists and an electronic version for digital applications (smartphones, etc.). These
versions are abridged and thus, for more detailed information, the
user should always access to the full text version of the guidelines,
which is freely available via the ESC and EACTS website and hosted
on the EHJ and EJCTS website. The National Cardiac Societies of the
ESC are encouraged to endorse, adopt, translate and implement all
ESC Guidelines. Implementation programmes are needed because it
has been shown that the outcome of disease may be favourably influenced by the thorough application of clinical recommendations.

Wording to use









**566** ESC/EACTS Guidelines

Table 2 Levels of evidence


Health professionals are encouraged to take the ESC/EACTS
Guidelines fully into account when exercising their clinical judgment,
as well as in the determination and the implementation of preventive,
diagnostic or therapeutic medical strategies. However, the ESC/
EACTS Guidelines do not override in any way whatsoever the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate and
accurate decisions in consideration of each patient’s health condition
and in consultation with that patient or the patient’s caregiver where
appropriate and/or necessary. It is also the healthcare professional’s
responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable in each
country to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.
### 2 Introduction

2.1 Why do we need new guidelines on
valvular heart disease?

Since the publication of the previous version of the guidelines on the
management of valvular heart disease (VHD) in 2017, new evidence
has accumulated, particularly on the following topics:

 - [Epidemiology: the incidence of the degenerative aetiology has]

increased in industrialized countries while, unfortunately, rheumatic heart disease is still too frequently observed in many parts
of the world. [1][�][3]

 - [Current practices regarding interventions and medical manage-]

ment have been analysed in new surveys at the national and
European level.

 - [Non-invasive evaluation using three-dimensional (3D) echocar-]

diography, cardiac computed tomography (CCT), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and biomarkers plays a more and more

central role.

 - [New definitions of severity of secondary mitral regurgitation]

(SMR) based on the outcomes of studies on intervention.

 - [New evidence on anti-thrombotic therapies leading to new rec-]

ommendations in patients with surgical or transcatheter biopros

long term. The recommendation for non- vitamin K antagonist
oral anticoagulants (NOACs) was reinforced in patients with
native valvular disease, except for significant mitral stenosis, and
in those with bioprostheses.

- [Risk stratification for the timing of intervention. This applies mostly]

to (i) the evaluation of progression in asymptomatic patients based
on recent longitudinal studies mostly in aortic stenosis, and (ii)
interventions in high-risk patients in whom futility should be
avoided. Regarding this last aspect, the role of frailty is outlined.

- [Results and indication of intervention:]

� The choice of the mode of intervention: current evidence

reinforces the critical role of the Heart Team, which

should integrate clinical, anatomical, and procedural
characteristics beyond conventional scores, and
informed patient’s treatment choice.

� Surgery: increasing experience and procedural safety
led to expansion of indications toward earlier intervention in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis,
aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation and stress
the preference for valve repair when it is expected
to be durable. A particular emphasis is put on the
need for more comprehensive evaluation and earlier
surgery in tricuspid regurgitation.

� Transcatheter techniques: (i) Concerning transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), new information from randomized studies comparing TAVI
vs. surgery in low-risk patients with a follow-up of
2 years has led to a need to clarify which types of
patients should be considered for each mode of
intervention. (ii) Transcatheter edge-to-edge
repair (TEER) is increasingly used in SMR and has
been evaluated against optimal medical therapy
resulting in an upgrade of the recommendation.
(iii) The larger number of studies on transcatheter
valve-in-valve implantation after failure of surgical
bioprostheses served as a basis to upgrade its

indication. (iv) Finally, the encouraging preliminary
experience with transcatheter tricuspid valve
interventions (TTVI) suggests a potential role of
this treatment in inoperable patients, although this
needs to be confirmed by further evaluation.

The new evidence described above made a revision of the recom
mendations necessary.

key points summarize the essentials. Gaps in evidence are listed to
propose topics for future research. The guideline document will be
harmonized with the chapter on VHD included in the ESC Textbook of
Cardiovascular Medicine (ISBN: 9780198784906). The guidelines and
the textbook are complementary. Background information and
detailed discussion of the data that have provided the basis for the
recommendations will be found in the relevant book chapter.

2.5 How to use these guidelines
The Committee emphasizes that many factors ultimately determine
the most appropriate treatment in individual patients within a given
community. These factors include the availability of diagnostic equipment, the expertise of cardiologists and surgeons, especially in the
field of valve repair and percutaneous intervention, and, notably, the
wishes of well-informed patients. Furthermore, owing to the lack of

evidence-based data in the field of VHD, most recommendations are

largely the result of expert consensus opinion. Therefore, deviations
from these guidelines may be appropriate in certain clinical

circumstances.

### 3 General comments

This section defines and discusses concepts common to all the types
of VHD including the Heart Team and Heart Valve Centres, the main
evaluation steps of patients presenting with VHD, as well as the most
commonly associated cardiac diseases.

3.1 Concepts of Heart Team and Heart
Valve Centre

The main purpose of Heart Valve Centres as centres of excellence in
the treatment of VHD is to deliver optimal quality of care with a
patient-centred approach. The main requirements of a Heart Valve
Centre are presented in Table 4.
This is achieved through high procedural volume in conjunction
with specialized training, continuous education, and focused clinical
interest. Heart Valve Centres should promote timely referral of
patients with VHD for comprehensive evaluation before irreversible
damage occurs.
Decisions concerning treatment and intervention should be
made by an active and collaborative Heart Team with expertise in
VHD, comprising clinical and interventional cardiologists, cardiac
surgeons, imaging specialists with expertise in interventional imaging, [7][,][8] cardiovascular anaesthesiologists, and other specialists if
necessary (e.g. heart failure specialists or electrophysiologists).
Dedicated nursing personnel with expertise in the care of patients
with VHD are also an important asset to the Heart Team. The
Heart Team approach is particularly advisable for the management of high-risk and asymptomatic patients, as well as in case of
uncertainty or lack of strong evidence.

Heart Valve Clinics are an important component of the Heart
Valve Centres, aiming to provide standardized organization of care
based on guidelines. Access to Heart Valve Clinics improves
outcomes. [9]

Physicians experienced in the management of VHD and dedicated
nurses organize outpatient visits, and referral to the Heart Team, if
needed. Earlier referral should be encouraged if patient’s symptoms
develop or worsen before the next planned visit. [10][,][11]

Beside the whole spectrum of valvular interventions, expertise
in interventional and surgical management of coronary artery disease (CAD), vascular diseases, and complications must be

available.

Techniques with a steep learning curve may be performed with
better results at hospitals with high procedural volume and experience. The relationship between case volume and outcomes for surgery and transcatheter interventions is complex but should not be
denied. [12][�][14] However, the precise numbers of procedures per individual operator or hospital required to provide high-quality care
remain controversial as inequalities exist between high- and middleincome countries. [15] High-volume TAVI programmes are associated
with lower mortality at 30 days, particularly at hospitals with a high
surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) volume. [16][,][17] The data available on transcatheter mitral valve repair [14][,][18] and, even more so,
transcatheter tricuspid procedures are more limited.

CCT = cardiac computed tomography; CMR = cardiac magnetic resonance.

Since performance does not exclusively relate to intervention volume, internal quality assessment consisting of systematic recording of
procedural data and patient outcomes at the level of a given Heart
Valve Centre is essential, as well as participation in national or ESC/
EACTS registries.
A Heart Valve Centre should have structured and possibly combined training programmes for interventionalists, cardiac surgeons,
and imaging specialists [13][,][19][,][20] [(https://ebcts.org/syllabus/). New tech-](https://ebcts.org/syllabus/)
niques should be taught by competent mentors to minimize the
effects of the learning curve.

Finally, Heart Valve Centres should contribute to optimizing the
management of patients with VHD, provide corresponding services
at the community level, and promote networks that include other
medical departments, referring cardiologists and primary care
physicians.

3.2 Patient evaluation

The aims of the evaluation of patients with VHD are to diagnose,
quantify, and assess the mechanism of VHD, as well as its

consequences.

**574** ESC/EACTS Guidelines


3.2.1 Clinical evaluation

Precise evaluation of the patient’s history and symptomatic status,
and proper physical examination, in particular auscultation [21] and
search for heart failure signs, are crucial. In addition, assessment of
their comorbidities and general condition require particular attention. The essential questions in the evaluation of a patient for valvular
intervention are summarized in Figure 1 (Central illustration).
. [.....................]


3.2.2 Echocardiography
Following adequate clinical evaluation, echocardiography is the key
technique used to confirm the diagnosis of VHD, as well as to assess
its aetiology, mechanisms, function, severity, and prognosis. It should
be performed and interpreted by properly trained imagers. [22][,][23]

Echocardiographic criteria for the definition of severe valve stenosis and regurgitation are addressed in specific documents [24][,][25] and

CMR = cardiac magnetic resonance; TOE= transoesophageal echocardiography; TTE = transthoracic echocardiography.

ESC/EACTS Guidelines **575**


summarized in the specific sections of these guidelines.
Echocardiography is also key to evaluating the feasibility of a specific

intervention.

Indices of left ventricular (LV) enlargement and function are strong
prognostic factors. Recent studies suggest that global longitudinal
strain has greater prognostic value than LV ejection fraction (LVEF),
although cut-off values are not uniform. [26][,][27] Transoesophageal
echocardiography (TOE) should be considered when transthoracic
echocardiography (TTE) is of suboptimal quality or when thrombosis, prosthetic valve dysfunction, or endocarditis is suspected.
TOE is useful when detailed functional valve anatomy is required
to assess repairability. Intraprocedural TOE, preferably 3D, is
used to guide transcatheter mitral and tricuspid valve procedures
and to assess the immediate result of surgical valve operations.
Multimodality imaging may be required in specific conditions for
evaluation and/or procedural guidance in TAVI and transcatheter
mitral interventions. [28][,][29]

3.2.3 Other non-invasive investigations
3.2.3.1 Stress testing
The primary purpose of exercise testing is to unmask the objective
occurrence of symptoms in patients who claim to be asymptomatic.
It is especially useful for risk stratification in aortic stenosis. [30] Exercise
testing will also determine the level of recommended physical activity, including participation in sports. It should be emphasized that
stress testing is safe and useful in asymptomatic patients with VHD.
Unfortunately, the VHD II survey indicates that it is rarely performed
in asymptomatic patients. [1]

Exercise echocardiography may identify the cardiac origin of dyspnoea. Prognostic impact has been shown mainly for aortic stenosis
and mitral regurgitation. [31][,][32]

The use of stress tests to detect CAD associated with severe valv
ular disease is discouraged because of their low diagnostic value and
potential risks in symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis.

3.2.3.2 Cardiac magnetic resonance
In patients with inadequate echocardiographic quality or discrepant
results, CMR should be used to assess the severity of valvular lesions,
particularly regurgitant lesions, and to assess ventricular volumes, systolic function, abnormalities of the ascending aorta, and myocardial
fibrosis. [33] CMR is the reference method for the evaluation of right
ventricular (RV) volumes and function and is therefore particularly
useful to evaluate the consequences of tricuspid regurgitation. [34] It
also has an incremental value for assessing the severity of aortic and
mitral regurgitation.

3.2.3.3 Computed tomography
CCT may contribute to the evaluation of valve disease severity,
particularly in aortic stenosis [35][,][36] and possibly associated disease
of the thoracic aorta (dilatation, calcification), as well as to evaluate the extent of MAC. CCT should be performed whenever the
echocardiographic data indicate an aortic enlargement >40 mm,
to clarify aortic diameter and to assess aortic morphology and
configuration. CCT is essential in the pre-procedural planning of
TAVI and can also be useful to assess patient-prosthesis mismatch
(PPM). [37] It is also a prerequisite for pre-procedural planning of

[38] Positron emission . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


tomography (PET)/CCT is useful in patients with a suspicion of
endocarditis of a prosthetic valve. [39][,][40]

3.2.3.4 Cinefluoroscopy
Cinefluoroscopy is particularly useful for assessing the kinetics of the
leaflet occluders of a mechanical prosthesis.

3.2.3.5 Biomarkers

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) serum levels, corrected for age and
sex, are useful in asymptomatic patients and may assist selection of
the appropriate time point for a given intervention, [41] particularly if
the level rises during follow-up. Other biomarkers have been tested,

with evidence for fibrosis, inflammation, and adverse ventricular
remodelling, which could improve decision making. [42]

3.2.3.6 Multimarkers and staging
In patients with at least moderate aortic stenosis and LVEF >50%,
staging according to damage associated with aortic stenosis on LV/
RV, left atrium (LA), mitral /tricuspid valve, and pulmonary circulation
was predictive of excess mortality after TAVI and SAVR, and may
help to identify patients who will benefit from an intervention. [43][,][44]

3.2.4 Invasive investigations
3.2.4.1 Coronary angiography
Coronary angiography is recommended for the assessment of CAD
when surgery or an intervention is planned, to determine if concomitant coronary revascularization is recommended (see recommendations for management of CAD in patients with VHD). [45][,][46]

Alternatively, owing to its high negative predictive value, CCT may be
used to rule out CAD in patients who are at low risk of atherosclero
sis. The usefulness of fractional flow reserve or instantaneous wave
free ratio in patients with VHD is not well established, and caution is
warranted in the interpretation of these measurements when VHD,
and in particular aortic stenosis, is present. [47][,][48]

3.2.4.2 Cardiac catheterization

The measurement of pressures and cardiac output or the assessment
of ventricular performance and valvular regurgitation by ventricular
angiography or aortography is restricted to situations where noninvasive evaluation by multimodality imaging is inconclusive or discordant with clinical findings. When elevated, pulmonary pressure is
the only criterion to support the indication for surgery, and confirmation of echo data by invasive measurement is recommended. Right
heart catheterization is also indicated in patients with severe tricuspid
regurgitation as Doppler gradient may be impossible or underestimate the severity of pulmonary hypertension.

3.2.5 Assessment of comorbidity
The choice of specific examinations to assess comorbidity is guided
by the clinical evaluation.

3.3 Risk stratification

Risk stratification applies to any sort of intervention and is required
for weighing the risk of intervention against the expected natural history of VHD and for choosing the type of intervention. Most experience relates to surgery and TAVI.


Indices of left ventricular (LV) enlargement and function are strong
prognostic factors. Recent studies suggest that global longitudinal
strain has greater prognostic value than LV ejection fraction (LVEF),
although cut-off values are not uniform. [26][,][27] Transoesophageal
echocardiography (TOE) should be considered when transthoracic
echocardiography (TTE) is of suboptimal quality or when thrombosis, prosthetic valve dysfunction, or endocarditis is suspected.
TOE is useful when detailed functional valve anatomy is required
to assess repairability. Intraprocedural TOE, preferably 3D, is
used to guide transcatheter mitral and tricuspid valve procedures
and to assess the immediate result of surgical valve operations.
Multimodality imaging may be required in specific conditions for
evaluation and/or procedural guidance in TAVI and transcatheter
mitral interventions. [28][,][29]

3.3.1 Risk scores

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) predicted risk of mortality
[(PROM) score (http://riskcalc.sts.org/stswebriskcalc/calculate) and](http://riskcalc.sts.org/stswebriskcalc/calculate)
the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II
[(EuroSCORE II; http://www.euroscore.org/calc.html) accurately dis-](http://www.euroscore.org/calc.html)
criminate high- and low-risk surgical patients and show good calibration to predict postoperative outcome after valvular surgery in the
majority of the patients, [49][,][50] while risk estimation may be less accurate in high-risk patients. [51] The STS-PROM score is dynamic and
changes over time. Of note, the risk scores have not been validated
for isolated tricuspid surgical interventions.

In isolation, surgical scores have major limitations for practical use
in patients undergoing transcatheter intervention because they do
not include major risk factors such as frailty, as well as anatomical
factors with impact on the procedure, either surgical or transcatheter

[porcelain aorta, previous chest radiation, mitral annular calcification
(MAC)].
New scores have been developed to estimate the risk in patients
undergoing TAVI, with better accuracy and discrimination than the
surgical risk scores, despite numerous limitations [52][�][54]

[(Supplementary Table 1).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data)

Experience with risk stratification is currently limited for other
interventional procedures, such as mitral or tricuspid interventions.

3.3.2 Other factors

Other factors should be taken into account:

 - [Frailty, defined as a decrease of physiologic reserve and ability to]

maintain homeostasis leading to an increased vulnerability to
stresses and conferring an increased risk of morbidity and mortality after both surgery and TAVI. [55] The assessment of frailty
should not rely on a subjective approach, such as the ‘eyeball
test’, but rather on a combination of different objective
estimates. [55][�][59] Several tools are available for assessing frailty
[(Supplementary Table 2,](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data) [59] [and Supplementary Table 3).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data) [60]

goes beyond survival and includes functional recovery. The futility of
interventions has to be taken into consideration, particularly for
transcatheter interventions. [63]

The high prevalence of comorbidity in the elderly makes assess
ment of the risk/benefit ratios of interventions more difficult, there
fore the role of the Heart Team is essential in this specific population
[of patients (Supplementary Table 5).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data)

3.4 Patient-related aspects
Patient-related life expectancy and expected quality of life should be
considered. The patient and their family should be thoroughly

informed and assisted in their decision on the best treatment
option. [13] A patient-centred approach would take patient-reported
outcome measures and patient-reported experience measures into
consideration and make these parameters part of the informed
choice offered to patients. [68][,][69]

When benefit in symptom relief aligns with a patient’s goals, care is
not futile. However, care is futile when no life prolongation or symptom relief is anticipated. [70]

3.5 Local resources

Even if it is desirable that Heart Valve Centres are able to perform a
large spectrum of procedures, either surgical or catheter-based,
specialization and thereby expertise in specific domains will vary and
should be taken into account when deciding on the orientation of the
patient in specific cases, such as complex surgical valve repair or

transcatheter intervention.

In addition, penetration of transcatheter interventions is heterogeneous worldwide and highly dependent on socioeconomic inequalities. [15][,][71] Appropriate stewardship of economic resources is a
fundamental responsibility of the Heart Team.

3.6 Management of associated conditions
3.6.1 Coronary artery disease
Recommendations for the management of CAD associated with
VHD are provided below and are detailed in specific sections (section 5 and section 6.2) of this guideline document, as well as in other
dedicated guideline documents. [45][,][46][,][72][,][73]

Therapeutic futility has been defined as a lack of medical efficacy, particularly when the physician judges that the therapy is unlikely to produce its intended clinical results, or lack of meaningful survival
according to the personal values of the patient. Assessment of futility

(LAA) occlusion should be considered in combination with valve surgery in patients with AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score >_2 to reduce
the thromboembolic risk. [80][�][82] The selected surgical technique
should ensure complete occlusion of the LAA. For patients with AF
and risk factors for stroke, long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) is
currently recommended, irrespective of the use of surgical ablation
of AF and/or surgical LAA occlusion.

Recommendations for the management of AF in native VHD are
summarized in the following table. The recommendations concerning
patients with valve prostheses, and the combination of anticoagulants

3.6.2 Atrial fibrillation

Detailed recommendations on the management of patients with
atrial fibrillation (AF) including management of anticoagulation are
provided in specific guidelines. [74] NOACs are recommended in
patients with aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation presenting with AF [75][�][78] as subgroup analyses of randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) support the use of apixaban, dabigatran,

edoxaban, and rivaroxaban. The use of NOACs is not recommended

in patients who have AF associated with clinically significant mitral
stenosis or those with mechanical prostheses.

Surgical ablation of AF combined with mitral valve surgery effectively reduces the incidence of AF but has no impact on adjusted
short-term survival. An increased rate of pacemaker implantation has
been observed after surgical ablation (9.5%, vs. 7.6% in the group
with AF and no surgical ablation). [79] Concomitant AF ablation should
be considered in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, balancing the
benefits of freedom from atrial arrhythmias with the risk factors for
recurrence, such as age, LA dilatation, years in AF, renal dysfunction,
and other cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, left atrial appendage

3.7 Endocarditis prophylaxis
Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for high-risk procedures
in patients with prosthetic valves, including transcatheter valves, or
with repairs using prosthetic material, and in patients with previous
episode(s) of infective endocarditis. [4] Particular attention to dental
and cutaneous hygiene and strict aseptic measures during any invasive
procedure are advised in this population. Antibiotic prophylaxis
should be considered in dental procedures involving manipulation of
the gingival or periapical region of the teeth or manipulation of the
oral mucosa. [4]

**578** ESC/EACTS Guidelines


3.8 Prophylaxis for rheumatic fever
Prevention of rheumatic heart disease should preferably target the first
attack of acute rheumatic fever. Antibiotic treatment of group A Streptococcus infection throat is key in primary prevention. Echocardiographic screening in combination with secondary antibiotic prophylaxis
in children with evidence of latent rheumatic heart disease is currently
investigated to reduce its prevalence in endemic regions. [91] In patients
with established rheumatic heart disease, secondary long-term prophylaxis against rheumatic fever is recommended: benzathine benzyl penicillin 1.2 MUI every 3 to 4 weeks over 10 years. Lifelong prophylaxis
should be considered in high-risk patients according to the severity of
VHD and exposure to group A Streptococcus. [92][�][95]
### 4 Aortic regurgitation

Aortic regurgitation can be caused by primary disease of the aortic
valve cusps and/or abnormalities of the aortic root and ascending aortic
geometry. Degenerative tricuspid and bicuspid aortic regurgitation are
the most common aetiologies in high-income countries, accounting for
approximately two-thirds of the underlying aetiology of aortic regurgitation in the EURObservational Registry Programme Valvular Heart
Disease II registry. [1] Other causes include infective and rheumatic endocarditis. Acute severe aortic regurgitation is mostly caused by infective
endocarditis, and less frequently by aortic dissection.

4.1 Evaluation

4.1.1 Echocardiography
Echocardiography is the key examination used to describe valve anatomy, quantify aortic regurgitation, evaluate its mechanisms, define
the morphology of the aorta, and determine the feasibility of valvesparing aortic surgery or valve repair. [96][,][97] Identification of the mechanism follows the same principle such as for mitral regurgitation:
normal cusps but insufficient coaptation due to dilatation of the aortic
root with central jet (type 1), cusp prolapse with eccentric jet (type
2), or retraction with poor cusp tissue quality and large central or
eccentric jet (type 3). [96] Quantification of aortic regurgitation follows
an integrated approach considering qualitative, semi-quantitative, and
quantitative parameters [24][,][98] (Table 5). New parameters obtained by
3D echocardiography and two-dimensional (2D) strain imaging as LV
global longitudinal strain may be useful, particularly in patients with
borderline LVEF where they may help in the decision for surgery. [99]

Measurement of the aortic root and ascending aorta in 2D is
performed at four levels: annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular
junction, and tubular ascending aorta. [100][,][101] Measurements are performed in the parasternal long-axis view from leading edge to leading
edge at end diastole, except for the aortic annulus, which is measured
in mid systole. As it will have surgical consequences, it is important to
differentiate three phenotypes of the ascending aorta: aortic root
aneurysms (sinuses of Valsalva >45 mm), tubular ascending aneurysm

�
(sinuses of Valsalva <40 45 mm), and isolated aortic regurgitation
(all aortic diameters <40 mm). The calculation of indexed values to
account for body size has been suggested, [102] in particular in patients
with small stature. Anatomy of the aortic valve cusps and its suitability
for valve repair should be provided by preoperative TOE if aortic
valve repair or a valve-sparing surgery of the aortic root is

considered. Intraoperative evaluation of the surgical result by TOE is
mandatory in patients undergoing aortic valve preservation or repair.

4.1.2 Computed tomography and cardiac magnetic

resonance

CMR should be used to quantify the regurgitant fraction when echocardiographic measurements are equivocal or discordant with clinical
findings. In patients with aortic dilatation, CCT is recommended to
assess the maximum diameter at four levels, as in echocardiography.
CMR can be used for follow-up, but indication for surgery should
preferably be based on CCT measurements. Different methods of
aortic measurements have been reported. To improve reproducibility, it is recommended to measure diameters using the inner-inneredge technique at end diastole on the strictly transverse plane by
double oblique reconstruction perpendicular to the axis of blood
flow of the corresponding segment. Maximum root diameter should

be taken from sinus-to-sinus diameter rather than sinus-to
commissure diameter, as it correlates more closely to long-axis leading-edge-to-leading-edge echo maximum diameters. [103][,][104]

4.2 Indications for intervention

Acute aortic regurgitation may require urgent surgery. It is mainly
caused by infective endocarditis and aortic dissection but may also
occur after blunt chest trauma and iatrogenic complications during
catheter-based cardiac interventions. Specific guidelines deal with

ESC/EACTS Guidelines **579**


these entities. [4][,][101] The recommendations on indications for surgery
in severe aortic regurgitation and aortic root disease may be related
to symptoms, status of the LV, or dilatation of the aorta [see table of
recommendations on indications for surgery in severe aortic regurgitation and aortic root or tubular ascending aortic aneurysm (irrespective of the severity of aortic regurgitation), and Figure 2].

In symptomatic patients, surgery is recommended irrespective of
the LVEF as long as aortic regurgitation is severe and the operative
risk is not prohibitive. [105][�][109] Surgery is recommended in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation
undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or surgery of
the ascending aorta or another valve. [110][,][111] In asymptomatic patients
with severe aortic regurgitation, impairment of LV function [LVEF
<_50% or left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) >50 mm] are
associated with worse outcomes and surgery should therefore be
pursued when these cut-offs are reached. [107][,][108][,][112][�][114] LVESD should
be related to body surface area (BSA) and a cut-off of 25 mm/m [2] BSA
appeared to be more appropriate, especially in patients with small
body size (BSA <1.68 m [2] ) or with large BSA who are not overweight. [108][,][115] Some recent retrospective, non-randomized studies
emphasized the role of indexed LVESD and proposed a lower cut-off
value of 20 or 22 mm/m [2] BSA for the indexed LVESD. [116][�][118] One of . [..................................................................]


40 mm or more) in women with low BSA, TGFBR2 mutation, and
severe extra-aortic features. [130] For patients who have an indication
for aortic valve surgery, an aortic diameter ≥45 mm is considered
to indicate concomitant surgery of the aortic root or tubular
ascending aorta. The patient’s stature, the aetiology of the valvular
disease (bicuspid valve), and the intraoperative shape and
wall thickness of the ascending aorta should be considered for

individual decisions.

The choice of the surgical procedure should be adapted according
to the experience of the team, the presence of an aortic root aneurysm, characteristics of the cusps, life expectancy, and desired anticoagulation status.
Valve replacement is the standard procedure in the majority of
patients with aortic regurgitation. Aortic valve-sparing root replacement
and valve repair yield good long-term results in selected patients, with
low rates of valve-related events as well as good quality of life [131][�][140]

when performed in experienced centres. Aortic valve-sparing root
replacement is recommended in younger patients who have an enlargement of the aortic root with normal cusp motion, when performed by
experienced surgeons. [133][�][136][,][140] In selected patients, aortic valve
repair [132][,][132][,][137] or the Ross procedure [138][,][139] may be an alternative to
valve replacement, when performed by experienced surgeons.


In symptomatic patients, surgery is recommended irrespective of
the LVEF as long as aortic regurgitation is severe and the operative
risk is not prohibitive. [105][�][109] Surgery is recommended in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation
undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or surgery of
the ascending aorta or another valve. [110][,][111] In asymptomatic patients
with severe aortic regurgitation, impairment of LV function [LVEF
<_50% or left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) >50 mm] are
associated with worse outcomes and surgery should therefore be
pursued when these cut-offs are reached. [107][,][108][,][112][�][114] LVESD should
be related to body surface area (BSA) and a cut-off of 25 mm/m [2] BSA
appeared to be more appropriate, especially in patients with small
body size (BSA <1.68 m [2] ) or with large BSA who are not overweight. [108][,][115] Some recent retrospective, non-randomized studies
emphasized the role of indexed LVESD and proposed a lower cut-off
value of 20 or 22 mm/m [2] BSA for the indexed LVESD. [116][�][118] One of
these studies also suggests a higher cut-off value of 55% for LVEF. [118]

Based on these data, low-risk surgery may be discussed in some
selected asymptomatic patients with LVESD >20 mm/m [2] or resting
LVEF between 50% and 55%. In patients not reaching the thresholds
for surgery, close follow-up is needed, and exercise testing should be
liberally performed to identify borderline symptomatic patients.
Progressive enlargement of the LV, or a progressive decrease in its
function in asymptomatic patients not reaching the thresholds for
surgery but with significant LV dilatation [left ventricular end-diastolic
diameter (LVEDD) >65 mm], may also be an appropriate indicator
for timing operations in asymptomatic patients.

TAVI may be considered in experienced centres for selected
patients with aortic regurgitation and ineligible for SAVR. [119][,][120]

In patients with a dilated aorta, the rationale for surgery has been
best defined in patients with Marfan syndrome and root dilation. [121][,][122] Root aneurysms require root replacement, with or without preservation of the native aortic valve. In contrast, tubular
ascending aortic aneurysms in the presence of normal aortic valves
require only a supracommissural tube graft replacement. In patients
with aortic diameters borderline indicated for aortic surgery, the family history, age, and anticipated risk of the procedure should be taken
into consideration. Irrespective of the degree of aortic regurgitation
and type of valve pathology, in patients with an aortic diameter
>_55 mm with tricuspid or bicuspid aortic valves, ascending aortic surgery is recommended (see recommendations on indications for surgery in severe aortic regurgitation and aortic root disease) when the
operative risk is not prohibitive. [123][�][125] In individuals with bicuspid
aortic valve, when additional risk factors or coarctation [126] are

present, surgery should be considered when aortic diameter is
>_50 mm. [127][�][129] In all patients with Marfan syndrome, aortic surgery
is recommended for a maximal aortic diameter >_50 mm. [5][,][121][,][122]

When additional risk factors are present in patients with Marfan syndrome and in patients with a TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutation (including

�
Loeys Dietz syndrome), surgery should be considered at a maximal
aortic diameter >_45 mm [121][,][130] and even earlier (aortic diameter of

4.3 Medical therapy
Medical therapy, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEI) or dihydropiridines, may provide symptomatic improvement
in individuals with chronic severe aortic regurgitation in whom surgery is not feasible. The value of ACEI or dihydropiridine in delaying
surgery in the presence of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation in
asymptomatic patients has not been established and their use is not

recommended for this indication.

In patients who undergo surgery but continue to suffer from heart
failure or hypertension, ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs),
and beta-blockers are useful. [141][,][142]

In patients with Marfan syndrome, beta-blockers remain the mainstay for medical treatment and reducing shear stress and aortic
growth rate and should be considered before and after surgery. [143][�][145] While ARBs did not prove to have a superior effect
when compared to beta-blockers, they may be considered as an
alternative in patients intolerant to beta-blockers. [146][�][148] By analogy,
while there are no studies that provide supporting evidence, it is
common clinical practice to advise beta-blocker or ARBs in patients
with bicuspid aortic valve if the aortic root and/or ascending aorta is
dilated. Management of aortic regurgitation during pregnancy is dis
cussed in section 13.

4.4 Serial testing
All asymptomatic patients with severe aortic regurgitation and normal LV function should be followed up at least every year. In patients
with either a first diagnosis or with LV diameter and/or ejection frac

surgery, follow-up should be continued at 3�6-month intervals.
Surgery may be considered in asymptomatic patients with significant
LV dilatation (LVEDD >65 mm), and with progressive enlargement in
the size of LV or progressive decrease of LVEF during follow-up.
Patient’s BNP levels could be of potential interest as a predictor of
outcomes (particularly symptom onset and deterioration of LV function) and may be helpful in the follow-up of asymptomatic patients. [149]

Patients with mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation can be seen on a
yearly basis and echocardiography performed every 2 years.

If the ascending aorta is dilated (>40 mm), it is recommended to
systematically perform CCT or CMR. Follow-up assessment of the
aortic dimension should be performed using echocardiography and/
or CMR. Any increase >3 mm should be validated by CCT angiography/CMR and compared with baseline data. After repair of the
ascending aorta, Marfan patients remain at risk for dissection of the
residual aorta and lifelong regular multidisciplinary follow-up at an
expert centre is required.

4.5 Special patient populations
If aortic regurgitation requiring surgery is associated with severe primary and secondary mitral regurgitation, both should be treated during the same operation.
In patients with moderate aortic regurgitation who undergo
CABG or mitral valve surgery, the decision to treat the aortic valve is
controversial, as data show that progression of moderate aortic
regurgitation is very slow in patients without aortic dilation. [150] The
Heart Team should decide based on the aetiology of aortic regurgitation, other clinical factors, the life expectancy of the patient, and the
patient’s operative risk.

The level of physical and sports activity in the presence of a dilated
aorta remains a matter of clinical judgment in the absence of evidence. Current guidelines are very restrictive, particularly regarding
isometric exercise, to avoid a catastrophic event. [151] This approach is
justified in the presence of connective tissue disease, but a more liberal approach is likely to be appropriate in other patients.

Given the familial risk of thoracic aortic aneurysms, screening and
referral for genetic testing of the patient’s first-degree relatives with
appropriate imaging studies is indicated in patients with connective
tissue disease. For patients with bicuspid valves, it is appropriate to
have an echocardiographic screening of first-degree relatives.
### 5 Aortic stenosis

Aortic stenosis is the most common primary valve lesion requiring
surgery or transcatheter intervention in Europe [1] and North America.
Its prevalence is rising rapidly as a consequence of the ageing
population. [2][,][152]

5.1 Evaluation

5.1.1 Echocardiography
Echocardiography is key to confirming the diagnosis and severity of
aortic stenosis, assessing valve calcification, LV function and wall
thickness, detecting other valve disease or aortic pathology, and providing prognostic information. [43][,][153][,][154] Assessment should be undertaken when blood pressure (BP) is well controlled to avoid the
flow effects of increased afterload. New . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


echocardiographic parameters, stress imaging and CCT
provide important adjunctive information when severity is uncertain
(Figure 3).

Current international recommendations for the echocardiographic evaluation of patients with aortic stenosis [25] depend upon
measurement of mean pressure gradient (the most robust parameter), peak transvalvular velocity (V max ), and valve area. Although valve
area is the theoretically ideal measurement for assessing severity,
there are numerous technical limitations. Clinical decision making in
discordant cases should therefore take account of additional parameters: functional status, stroke volume, Doppler velocity index, [156]

degree of valve calcification, LV function, the presence or absence of
LV hypertrophy, flow conditions, and the adequacy of BP control. [25]

Low flow is arbitrarily defined by a stroke volume index (SVi) <_35
mL/m [2] —a threshold that is under current debate. [155][,][157][,][158] The use
of sex -specific thresholds has been recently proposed. [159] Four broad
categories can be defined:

 - [High-gradient aortic stenosis [mean gradient >_40 mmHg, peak]
velocity >_4.0 m/s, valve area <_1 cm [2] (or <_0.6 cm [2] /m [2] )]. Severe
aortic stenosis can be assumed irrespective of LV function and

flow conditions.

 - [Low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis with reduced ejection]
fraction (mean gradient <40 mmHg, valve area <_1 cm [2], LVEF
<50%, SVi <_35 mL/m [2] ). Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is recommended to distinguish between true
severe and pseudo-severe aortic stenosis (increase in valve area
to >1.0 cm [2] with increased flow) and identify patients with no
flow (or contractile) reserve. [160] However, utility in elderly
patients has only been evaluated in small registries. [161]

 - [Low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis with preserved ejection]
fraction (mean gradient <40 mmHg, valve area <_1 cm [2], LVEF
>_50%, SVi <_35 mL/m [2] ). Typically encountered in hypertensive
elderly subjects with small LV size and marked hypertrophy. [157][,][162] This scenario may also result from conditions associated with low stroke volume (e.g. moderate/severe mitral
regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, severe mitral stenosis, and large ventricular septal defect and severe RV dysfunction).
Diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis is challenging and requires
careful exclusion of measurement errors and other explanations
for the echocardiographic findings, [25] as well as the presence or
absence of typical symptoms (with no other explanation), LV
hypertrophy (in the absence of coexistent hypertension) or
reduced LV longitudinal strain (with no other cause). CCT
assessment of the degree of valve calcification provides important additional information [thresholds (Agatston units) for
severe aortic stenosis: men >3000, women >1600= highly likely;
men >2000, women >1200 = likely; men <1600, women
<800 = unlikely]. [35][,][36][,][163][,][164]

 - [Normal-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis with preserved ejec-]
tion fraction (mean gradient <40 mmHg, valve area <_1 cm [2],
LVEF>_50%, SVi >35 mL/m [2] ). These patients usually have only
moderate aortic stenosis. [36][,][165][�][167]

5.1.2 Additional diagnostic and prognostic parameters
The resting Doppler velocity index (DVI, also termed ‘dimensionless
index’)—the ratio of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) time

Patients with mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation can be seen on a
yearly basis and echocardiography performed every 2 years.

If the ascending aorta is dilated (>40 mm), it is recommended to
systematically perform CCT or CMR. Follow-up assessment of the
aortic dimension should be performed using echocardiography and/
or CMR. Any increase >3 mm should be validated by CCT angiography/CMR and compared with baseline data. After repair of the
ascending aorta, Marfan patients remain at risk for dissection of the
residual aorta and lifelong regular multidisciplinary follow-up at an
expert centre is required.


4.5 Special patient populations
If aortic regurgitation requiring surgery is associated with severe primary and secondary mitral regurgitation, both should be treated during the same operation.
In patients with moderate aortic regurgitation who undergo
CABG or mitral valve surgery, the decision to treat the aortic valve is
controversial, as data show that progression of moderate aortic
regurgitation is very slow in patients without aortic dilation. [150] The
Heart Team should decide based on the aetiology of aortic regurgitation, other clinical factors, the life expectancy of the patient, and the
patient’s operative risk.

The level of physical and sports activity in the presence of a dilated
aorta remains a matter of clinical judgment in the absence of evidence. Current guidelines are very restrictive, particularly regarding
isometric exercise, to avoid a catastrophic event. [151] This approach is
justified in the presence of connective tissue disease, but a more liberal approach is likely to be appropriate in other patients.

Given the familial risk of thoracic aortic aneurysms, screening and
referral for genetic testing of the patient’s first-degree relatives with
appropriate imaging studies is indicated in patients with connective
tissue disease. For patients with bicuspid valves, it is appropriate to
have an echocardiographic screening of first-degree relatives.

velocity integral (TVI) to that of the aortic valve jet—does not
require calculation of LVOT area and may assist evaluation when
other parameters are equivocal (a value <0.25 suggests that severe
aortic stenosis is highly likely). [156] Assessment of global longitudinal
strain provides additional information concerning LV function and a
threshold of 15% may help to identify patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis who are at higher risk of clinical deterioration
or premature mortality. [26][,][168] TOE allows evaluation of concomitant
mitral valve disease and may be of value for periprocedural imaging
during TAVI and SAVR. [169]

Natriuretic peptides predict symptom-free survival and outcome
in normal and low-flow severe aortic stenosis. [170][,][171] They can be
used to arbitrate the source of symptoms in patients with multiple
potential causes and identify those with high-risk asymptomatic aortic
stenosis who may benefit from early intervention (section 5.2.2, Table
6 and Figure 3).

Exercise testing may unmask symptoms and is recommended for
risk stratification of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. [172] Exercise echocardiography provides additional prognostic
information by assessing the increase in mean pressure gradient and
change in LV function. [173]

CCT provides information concerning the anatomy of the aortic
root and ascending aorta, and the extent and distribution of valve and
vascular calcification, and feasibility of vascular access. [174]

Quantification of valve calcification predicts disease progression and
clinical events [164] and may be useful when combined with geometric
assessment of valve area in assessing the severity of aortic stenosis in
patients with low valve gradient. [35][,][36][,][163][,][164]

Myocardial fibrosis is a major driver of LV decompensation in
aortic stenosis (regardless of the presence or absence of CAD),
which can be detected and quantified using CMR. Amyloidosis is also
frequently associated with aortic stenosis in elderly patients (incidence 9�15%). [175] When cardiac amyloidosis is clinically suspected,
based on symptoms (neuropathy and hematologic data), diphosphonate scintigraphy and/or CMR should be considered. Both entities
persist following valve intervention and are associated with poor
long-term prognosis. [176][�][179]

Coronary angiography is essential prior to TAVI and SAVR to
determine the potential need for concomitant revascularization (see
section 3.2.4.1 and section 5.5). Retrograde LV catheterization is not
recommended unless there are symptoms and signs of severe aortic
stenosis and non-invasive investigations are inconclusive.

5.1.3 TAVI diagnostic workup
Prior to TAVI, CCT is the preferred imaging tool to assess: (i) aortic
valve anatomy, (ii) annular size and shape, (iii) extent and distribution
of valve and vascular calcification, (iv) risk of coronary ostial obstruction, (v) aortic root dimensions, (vi) optimal fluoroscopic projections
for valve deployment, and (vii) feasibility of vascular access (femoral,
subclavian, axillary, carotid, transcaval or transapical). Adverse anatomical findings may suggest that SAVR is a better treatment option
(Table 6). TOE is more operator-dependent but may be considered
when CCT is difficult to interpret or relatively contraindicated (e.g.
chronic renal failure).

5.2 Indications for intervention (SAVR or
TAVI)

Indications for aortic valve intervention are summarized in the table

of recommendations on indications for intervention in symptomatic
and asymptomatic aortic stenosis and recommended mode of intervention and in Figure 4.

5.2.1 Symptomatic aortic stenosis
Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis has dismal prognosis and early
intervention is strongly recommended in all patients. The only . [...............................]


exceptions are for those in whom intervention is unlikely to improve
quality of life or survival (due to severe comorbidities) or for those
with concomitant conditions associated with survival <1 year (e.g.
malignancy) (section 3).

Intervention is recommended in symptomatic patients with highgradient aortic stenosis, regardless of LVEF. However, management
of patients with low-gradient aortic stenosis is more challenging:

 - [LV function usually improves after intervention in patients with]

low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis, when reduced ejection
fraction is predominantly caused by excessive afterload. [32][,][180]

ESC/EACTS Guidelines **585**


Conversely, improvement is uncertain if the primary cause of
reduced ejection fraction is scarring due to myocardial infarction
or cardiomyopathy. Intervention is recommended when severe
aortic stenosis is confirmed by stress echocardiography (true
severe aortic stenosis; Figure 3), [32] while patients with pseudo
severe aortic stenosis should receive conventional heart failure
treatment. [142][,][181] The presence or absence of flow reserve
(increase in stroke volume >_20%) does not appear to influence
prognosis in contemporary series of patients undergoing TAVI or
SAVR, [182][�][184] and although those with no flow reserve show
increased procedural mortality, both modes of intervention
improve ejection fraction and clinical outcomes. [32][,][180][,][182]

Decision making for such patients should take account of comorbidities, degree of valve calcification, extent of CAD, and feasibility of revascularization.

[Data concerning the natural history of low-flow, low-gradient]

aortic stenosis and preserved ejection fraction, and outcomes
after SAVR and TAVI remain controversial. [162][,][165][,][167] Intervention

should only be considered in those with symptoms and significant
valve obstruction (see table of recommendations on indications
for intervention in symptomatic and asymptomatic aortic stenosis and recommended mode of intervention and Figure 4).

[The prognosis of patients with normal-flow, low-gradient aortic]

stenosis and preserved ejection fraction is similar to that of moderate aortic stenosis—regular clinical and echocardiographic surveillance is recommended. [165][,][166][,][185]

Asymptomatic aortic stenosis
Intervention is recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe

determine future recommendations.

Predictors of symptom development and adverse outcomes in
asymptomatic patients include clinical characteristics (older age, atherosclerotic risk factors), echocardiographic parameters (valve calcification, peak jet velocity [189][,][190] ), LVEF, rate of haemodynamic

A). [170][,][171][,][194][,][195] Early intervention may be considered in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and one or more of these
predictors if procedural risk is low (although application of TAVI in
this setting has yet to be formally evaluated) (Table 6 and Figure 4).
Otherwise, watchful waiting is a safer and more appropriate strategy.

5.2.3 The mode of intervention

Use of SAVR and TAVI as complementary treatment options has
allowed a substantial increase in the overall number of patients with
aortic stenosis undergoing surgical or transcatheter intervention in
the past decade. [196] RCTs have assessed the two modes of intervention across the spectrum of surgical risk in predominantly elderly
patients and a detailed appraisal of the evidence base is provided in
[Supplementary Section 5. In brief, these trials used surgical risk scores](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data)
to govern patient selection and demonstrate that TAVI is superior to
medical therapy in extreme-risk patients, [197] and non-inferior to
SAVR in high- [198][�][201] and intermediate-risk patients at follow-up
extending to 5 years. [202][�][208] The more recent PARTNER 3 and

Evolut Low Risk trials demonstrate that TAVI is non-inferior to
SAVR in low-risk patients at 2-year follow-up. [209][�][212] Importantly,
patients in the low-risk trials were predominantly male and relatively
elderly (e.g. PARTNER 3: mean age 73.4 years, <70 years 24%,
70�75 years 36%, >75 years 40%, >80 years 13%) whilst those with

low-flow aortic stenosis or adverse anatomical characteristics for

either procedure (including bicuspid aortic valves or complex coronary disease) were excluded.

Rates of vascular complications, pacemaker implantation, and paravalvular regurgitation are consistently higher after TAVI, whereas
severe bleeding, acute kidney injury, and new-onset AF are more frequent after SAVR. Although the likelihood of paravalvular regurgitation has been reduced with newer transcatheter heart valve designs,
pacemaker implantation (and new-onset left bundle branch block)
may have long-term consequences [213][�][215] and further refinements
are required. Most patients undergoing TAVI have a swift recovery,
short hospital stay, and rapidly return to normal activities. [216][,][217]

Despite these benefits, there is wide variation in worldwide access to
the procedure as a result of high device costs and differing levels of
healthcare resources. [71][,][218][,][219]

The Task Force has attempted to address the gaps in evidence
and provide recommendations concerning the indications for
intervention and mode of treatment (Recommendations on indications for intervention in symptomatic and asymptomatic aortic
stenosis and recommended mode of intervention, Figure 4) that
are guided by the RCT findings and compatible with real-world
Heart Team decision making for individual patients (many of
whom fall outside the RCT inclusion criteria). Aortic stenosis is a
heterogeneous condition and selection of the most appropriate
mode of intervention should be carefully considered by the Heart
Team for all patients, accounting for individual age and estimated
life expectancy, comorbidities (including frailty and overall quality
of life, section 3), anatomical and procedural characteristics (Table
6), the relative risks of SAVR and TAVI and their long-term outcomes, prosthetic heart valve durability, feasibility of transfemoral
TAVI, and local experience and outcome data. These factors
should be discussed with the patient and their family to allow

informed treatment choice.


Decision making for such patients should take account of comorbidities, degree of valve calcification, extent of CAD, and feasibility of revascularization.

- [Data concerning the natural history of low-flow, low-gradient]

aortic stenosis and preserved ejection fraction, and outcomes
after SAVR and TAVI remain controversial. [162][,][165][,][167] Intervention

should only be considered in those with symptoms and significant
valve obstruction (see table of recommendations on indications
for intervention in symptomatic and asymptomatic aortic stenosis and recommended mode of intervention and Figure 4).

- [The prognosis of patients with normal-flow, low-gradient aortic]

stenosis and preserved ejection fraction is similar to that of moderate aortic stenosis—regular clinical and echocardiographic surveillance is recommended. [165][,][166][,][185]


5.2.2 Asymptomatic aortic stenosis
Intervention is recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe
aortic stenosis and impaired LV function of no other cause, [9] and
those who are asymptomatic during normal activities but develop
symptoms during exercise testing. [172][,][186] Management of asympto
matic severe aortic stenosis is otherwise controversial and the deci
sion to intervene requires careful assessment of the benefits and risks
in an individual patient.

In the absence of adverse prognostic features, watchful waiting has
generally been recommended with prompt intervention at symptom
onset. [187] Data from a single RCT have shown significant reduction in
the primary endpoint (death during or within 30 days of surgery or
cardiovascular death during the entire follow-up period) following
early SAVR compared with conservative management [1% vs. 15%;

�
hazard ratio 0.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.01 0.67;
P = 0.003]. [188] However, subjects were selected per inclusion criteria
(median age 64 years, minimal comorbidities, low operative risk) and
follow-up in the conservative group was limited. Further randomized
trials [EARLY TAVR (NCT03042104), AVATAR (NCT02436655),
EASY-AS (NCT04204915), EVOLVED (NCT03094143)] will help

determine future recommendations.

Predictors of symptom development and adverse outcomes in
asymptomatic patients include clinical characteristics (older age, atherosclerotic risk factors), echocardiographic parameters (valve calcification, peak jet velocity [189][,][190] ), LVEF, rate of haemodynamic
progression, [189] increase in mean gradient >20 mmHg with exercise, [172] severe LV hypertrophy, [191] indexed stroke volume, [158] LA
volume, [192] LV global longitudinal strain, [26][,][168][,][193] and abnormal biomarker levels (natriuretic peptides, troponin, and fetuin
**586** ESC/EACTS Guidelines


The interplay between estimated life expectancy and prosthetic
heart valve durability is a key consideration in these discussions. Age
is a surrogate for life expectancy but had no impact on the outcomes
of the low-risk RCTs at 1�2 year follow-up. Life expectancy varies
widely across the world and is highly dependent on absolute age, sex,
[frailty, and the presence of comorbidities (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2017-life-tables-1950-2017)

guide than age alone but is difficult to determine in individual patients.

ESC/EACTS Guidelines **587**


In summary, prosthetic heart valve durability is a key consideration
in younger patients (<75 years) at low surgical risk and SAVR (if feasible) is therefore the preferred treatment option. Conversely, durability is a lower priority in older patients (>_75 years), or those who are
inoperable or high risk for surgery, and TAVI is preferred in these
groups (particularly if feasible via transfemoral approach). The Heart
Team should make tailored recommendations for remaining patients
based upon their individual characteristics (Table 6). This guidance
should be re-addressed when further data concerning the long-term
durability of TAVI become available.
Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) may be considered as a bridge
to TAVI or SAVR in patients with decompensated aortic stenosis and
(when feasible) in those with severe aortic stenosis who require
urgent high-risk non-cardiac surgery (NCS) (section 12). The procedure carries significant risk of complications [234] and should only be

undertaken after Heart Team discussion.

5.3 Medical therapy
No medical therapies influence the natural history of aortic stenosis. Statins (which demonstrated favourable effects in pre-clinical
studies) do not affect disease progression [246] and clinical trials targeting calcium metabolic pathways are ongoing. Patients with heart
failure who are unsuitable (or waiting) for SAVR or TAVI should be
medically treated according to ESC heart failure Guidelines. [247] ACEI
are safe in aortic stenosis (provided that BP is monitored carefully)
and may have beneficial myocardial effects before the onset of symptoms, and after TAVI and SAVR. [248][�][250] Coexisting hypertension
should be treated to avoid additional afterload, although medication
(particularly vasodilators) should be titrated to avoid symptomatic
hypotension.

Antithrombotic therapy after TAVI is discussed in section 11.

5.4 Serial testing
Rate of progression of aortic stenosis varies widely. Asymptomatic
patients, their family and medical carers need careful education, with
emphasis on the importance of regular follow-up (ideally in a Heart
Valve Clinic [9] ) and prompt reporting of symptoms. Those with severe
aortic stenosis should be followed up every 6 months (at least) to
allow earliest symptom detection (using exercise testing if symptoms
are doubtful) and any change in echocardiographic parameters (particularly LVEF). Measurement of natriuretic peptides may be

considered.

Several studies suggest that the prognosis of moderate degenerative
aortic stenosis is worse than previously considered [251][�][254] (particularly
if there is significant valve calcification) and these patients should be reevaluated at least annually. Younger patients with mild aortic stenosis

�
and no significant calcification may be followed up every 2 3 years.

5.5 Special patient populations
Women with aortic stenosis have higher mortality than men, resulting from late diagnosis and initial specialist assessment followed by
less frequent and delayed referral for intervention. [255][�][257] Measures
are needed to improve this situation and ensure that both sexes
receive equivalent care.

CAD and aortic stenosis frequently coexist and the combination
confers higher risk of clinical events, therefore the need to consider
revascularization in conjunction with aortic valve intervention is

h Moderate aortic stenosis is defined as a valve area of 1.0�1.5 cm 2 (or mean
aortic gradient of 25�40 mmHg) in normal flow conditions—clinical assessment
is essential to determine whether SAVR is appropriate for an individual patient.

Although some (now abandoned) surgical bioprosthetic designs
have failed early, the durability of contemporary surgical bioprosthetic valves beyond 10 years is well established. [220] Conversely,
registry data provide some reassurance concerning the long-term
durability of TAVI devices up to 8 years but largely relate to older
high-/intermediate-risk patients, [221][�][224] whereas information concerning durability in low-risk patients is currently limited to 2-year
follow-up. Data comparing the durability of transcatheter heart
valves and surgical bioprostheses directly remain limited. Rates of
aortic valve re-intervention were higher after TAVI using a
balloon-expandable valve compared to SAVR at 5-year follow-up
in the PARTNER 2A trial (3.2% vs. 0.8%; hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% CI,
1.3�8.1), [206] whereas rates of structural valve deterioration
(SVD) were not statistically different following SAVR and TAVI
using the third generation SAPIEN 3 device in a parallel observational registry over the same time frame. [225]

Valve-in-valve TAVI is an established treatment option for surgical bioprosthetic valve deterioration but may not be appropriate
or feasible in all patients due to the increased likelihood of PPM in
patients with a small aortic root (or undersized original prosthesis), incompatible surgical valve designs associated with increased
risk of coronary occlusion, or difficult vascular access; re-do SAVR
should also be considered in these settings. [226][�][228] Favourable

short-term outcomes of redo-TAVI have been demonstrated in

selected older patients with transcatheter heart valve deterioration, [229] despite theoretical concerns relating to maintained coronary access. [230]

A bicuspid aortic valve is more frequent in younger patients with
aortic stenosis. While several registries have reported excellent outcomes of TAVI in patients with a bicuspid valve who were unsuitable
for surgery, [231][�][233] SAVR remains more appropriate in patients with
aortic stenosis affecting a bicuspid valve and in those with associated
disease (e.g. aortic root dilatation, complex coronary disease, or
severe mitral regurgitation) requiring a surgical approach.

common. The impact of coronary revascularization in patients with
silent CAD accompanying aortic stenosis is unclear and further studies are warranted in this context (section 3). Both simultaneous
SAVR and CABG, and SAVR late after CABG, carry a higher procedural risk than isolated SAVR. Nevertheless, retrospective data indicate that patients with moderate aortic stenosis, in whom CABG is
indicated, benefit from concomitant SAVR. Patients aged <70
years with mean gradient progression >_5 mmHg/year benefit from
SAVR at the time of CABG once baseline peak gradient exceeds
30 mmHg. [258] Decisions for individual patients should take into
account haemodynamic data, rate of progression, extent of leaflet
calcification, life expectancy, and associated comorbidities, as well as
the individual risk of concomitant SAVR or deferred TAVI. [244]

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and TAVI may be
undertaken as combined or staged procedures according to the clinical situation, pattern of CAD, and extent of myocardium at risk. [259] In
the SURTAVI trial, there was no significant difference in the primary
endpoint (all-cause mortality or stroke at 2-year follow-up) in
intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis and noncomplex CAD (SYNTAX score <22) undergoing either TAVI and

�
PCI or SAVR and CABG [16.0% (95% CI, 11.1 22.9) vs. 14% (95%
CI, 9.2�21.1); P = 0.62]. [260] Assessing the clinical value of systematic
PCI in TAVI patients with significant associated CAD is the objective
of ongoing RCTs. Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
and diffuse CAD unsuitable for revascularization should receive optimal medical therapy and undergo SAVR or TAVI according to individ
ual characteristics.

Severity of mitral regurgitation accompanying severe aortic stenosis may be overestimated as a result of elevated LV pressures and
careful quantification is required. In patients with severe primary
mitral regurgitation (PMR), mitral valve surgery is required at the
time of SAVR. In patients with severe SMR, surgery may also be considered in the presence of significant annular dilatation and marked
LV enlargement. In high-risk or inoperable patients with severe aortic
stenosis and severe mitral regurgitation, combined (or more often
sequential) TAVI and TEER may be feasible, but there is insufficient
experience to allow robust recommendations. [261][�][263] In patients
with severe PMR, TEER should be considered early if the patient
remains symptomatic and mitral regurgitation is still severe after
TAVI. In patients with severe SMR, TAVI should be followed by careful clinical and echocardiographic reassessment to determine
whether further mitral intervention is required. [264]

Section 4 provides recommendations for the management of
aneurysm/dilatation of the ascending aorta accompanying aortic
stenosis. Assessment and management of congenital aortic stenosis is
addressed in ESC Guidelines on adult congenital heart disease. [265]
### 6 Mitral regurgitation

Mitral regurgitation is the second-most frequent VHD in Europe. [1][,][3]

The underlying mechanism (primary or secondary) determines the
therapeutic approach.

deficiency and Barlow disease) is most frequent in Western countries. [1][,][2][,][266] In low-income countries, rheumatic aetiology is the most
frequent cause of mitral regurgitation. [267] Endocarditis can cause PMR
and is addressed in the corresponding ESC Guidelines. [4]

6.1.1 Evaluation

Echocardiography is the first choice of imaging technique to grade
PMR (Table 7). An integrative approach including qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative measures of mitral regurgitation (besides
quantification of LV and LA dimensions) is recommended. [24][,][268]

Routinely measured effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) is
strongly associated with all-cause mortality, and compared with the
general population an excess mortality appears for an EROA
>_20 mm [2] and steadily increases beyond 40 mm [2] . [269] Evaluation of the
specific lesion leading to mitral regurgitation has prognostic implications [266][,][270] and is fundamental to determine the feasibility of surgical
and transcatheter valve repair [271][�][273] [(Supplementary Figure 1). Three-](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data)
dimensional TOE provides an ‘en face’ view of the mitral leaflets
resembling the surgical inspection of the valve, thereby facilitating
Heart Team discussion. [24][,][268] In addition, 3D echocardiography has
shown better agreement with CMR in quantifying the regurgitant volume than 2D echocardiography, particularly in eccentric, multiple and
late-systolic regurgitant jets. [274][�][277] When various echocardiographic
parameters used to grade mitral regurgitation are inconsistent, CMR
is a valid alternative to quantify the regurgitant volume and is the
reference standard to quantify LV and LA volumes. [278] In addition,
quantification of mitral regurgitation with CMR has shown prognostic
implications. [277] Finally, preliminary data show that myocardial fibrosis
assessed with CMR is frequent in PMR and has been associated with
sudden cardiac death and ventricular arrhythmias. [279]

Exercise echocardiography permits evaluation of changes in mitral
regurgitant volume and pulmonary pressures during peak exercise
and is particularly helpful in patients with discordant symptoms and
regurgitation grade at rest. [280][,][281] In asymptomatic patients with

severe PMR and non-dilated LV and LA, low BNP values are associated with low mortality and can be useful during follow-up. [41][,][282]

LV dimensions and ejection fraction are considered to guide the
management of patients with severe PMR. However, there is cumulative evidence showing that LV global longitudinal strain has incremental prognostic value in patients treated with surgical repair. [283][,][284]

Recently, the Mitral Regurgitation International Database (MIDA)
score has been proposed to estimate the risk of all-cause mortality in
patients with severe PMR due to flail leaflet, who are under medical
treatment or surgically treated. [285] Among the variables included in

the score, LA diameter >_55 mm and LVESD >_40 mm are new

thresholds that have been included in the current recommendations.

Right heart catheterization is systematically used to confirm pulmonary hypertension diagnosed by echocardiography when this is
the only criterion to refer the patient for surgery.

6.1.2 Indications for intervention

Urgent surgery is indicated in patients with acute severe mitral regurgitation. In the case of papillary muscle rupture as the underlying disease, valve replacement is generally required.
Indications for surgery in severe chronic PMR are shown in the following table of recommendations and in Figure 5. Surgery is


Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and TAVI may be
undertaken as combined or staged procedures according to the clinical situation, pattern of CAD, and extent of myocardium at risk. [259] In
the SURTAVI trial, there was no significant difference in the primary
endpoint (all-cause mortality or stroke at 2-year follow-up) in
intermediate-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis and noncomplex CAD (SYNTAX score <22) undergoing either TAVI and

�
PCI or SAVR and CABG [16.0% (95% CI, 11.1 22.9) vs. 14% (95%
CI, 9.2�21.1); P = 0.62]. [260] Assessing the clinical value of systematic
PCI in TAVI patients with significant associated CAD is the objective
of ongoing RCTs. Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
and diffuse CAD unsuitable for revascularization should receive optimal medical therapy and undergo SAVR or TAVI according to individ
ual characteristics.

Severity of mitral regurgitation accompanying severe aortic stenosis may be overestimated as a result of elevated LV pressures and
careful quantification is required. In patients with severe primary
mitral regurgitation (PMR), mitral valve surgery is required at the
time of SAVR. In patients with severe SMR, surgery may also be considered in the presence of significant annular dilatation and marked
LV enlargement. In high-risk or inoperable patients with severe aortic
stenosis and severe mitral regurgitation, combined (or more often
sequential) TAVI and TEER may be feasible, but there is insufficient
experience to allow robust recommendations. [261][�][263] In patients
with severe PMR, TEER should be considered early if the patient
remains symptomatic and mitral regurgitation is still severe after
TAVI. In patients with severe SMR, TAVI should be followed by careful clinical and echocardiographic reassessment to determine
whether further mitral intervention is required. [264]

Section 4 provides recommendations for the management of
aneurysm/dilatation of the ascending aorta accompanying aortic
stenosis. Assessment and management of congenital aortic stenosis is
addressed in ESC Guidelines on adult congenital heart disease. [265]

Recommendations on indications for intervention in
severe primary mitral regurgitation



When surgery is considered, mitral valve repair is the surgical
intervention of first choice when the results are expected to be durable according to the Heart Team evaluation since it is associated with
better survival compared to mitral valve replacement. [293][,][294] PMR
due to segmental valve prolapse can be repaired with a low risk of
recurrence and reoperation. [294][�][296] The reparability of rheumatic
lesions, extensive valve prolapse and to a greater extent leaflet calcification or extensive annular calcification is more challenging. [297][,][298]

Patients requiring a predictably complex repair should undergo surgery in experienced repair centres with high repair rates, low operative mortality, and a record of durable results. When repair is not
feasible, mitral valve replacement with preservation of the subvalvular
apparatus is favoured.

Transcatheter mitral valve implantation for severe PMR is a safe
alternative in patients with contraindications for surgery or high operative risk. [299][�][302] TEER is the most evidenced, while the safety and

6.1.5 Special populations
Sex differences in terms of prevalence of underlying aetiology of PMR
and management have been reported. [298][,][315][,][316] Despite the reduction in the prevalence of rheumatic disease in Western countries,
women still have higher rates of rheumatic mitral regurgitation than
men and emerging aetiologies such as radiation heart disease are also
more frequent in women. [297] These aetiologies are often characterized by severe calcification of the mitral valve apparatus and associated with mitral stenosis precluding durable repair. Women with
PMR referred for surgical treatment received mitral valve repair at a
similar rate to men. [316] However, women more frequently present
with post-operative heart failure, probably related to a later referral
and more advanced disease as compared to men.

6.2 Secondary mitral regurgitation
In SMR, the valve leaflets and chordae are structurally normal and
mitral regurgitation results from an imbalance between closing and
tethering forces secondary to alterations in LV and LA geometry. [317][,][318] It is most commonly seen in dilated or ischaemic cardiomyopathies, both in severely dilated LV with markedly depressed LV
function or after an isolated infero-basal myocardial infarction leading
to posterior leaflet tethering, despite almost normal LV size and ejection fraction. SMR may also arise as a consequence of LA enlargement and mitral annular dilatation in patients with longstanding AF, in
whom LVEF is usually normal and LV dilatation less pronounced (so
called ‘atrial functional mitral regurgitation’). [319]

6.2.1 Evaluation

The echocardiographic criteria to define severe SMR do not differ
from those used in PMR and an integrative approach should be used
(Table 7). [24][,][268] However, it should be acknowledged that when quantifying EROA and regurgitant volume in SMR, lower thresholds may
be applied to define severe SMR. In heart failure patients, the total
forward LV stroke volume is lower and that may lead to lower estimated regurgitant volume (<60 mL/beat). Calculation of regurgitant

fraction in those circumstances could account for lower flows and
has shown prognostic implications. [320] In addition, the crescent shape
of the regurgitant orifice, characteristic of SMR, may lead to underes
timation of the vena contracta width and of the EROA. An EROA
>_30 mm [2] by 2D proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) likely corresponds to severe SMR. In contrast, whether an EROA >_20 mm [2]

defines severe SMR remains controversial. In heart failure patients,
even mild mitral regurgitation is associated with poor prognosis [321]

and evidence that surgical or transcatheter treatment of moderate
SMR does not seem to improve patient outcomes [322][,][323] supports
the change in definition of severe SMR. Caution is required, therefore, when labelling severe SMR based solely on prognostic implications. Other factors such as the extent of myocardial scar, as
assessed with CMR, have been associated with poor prognosis. [324] In
addition, LVEF has been shown to be misleading in patients with
severe SMR, while LV global longitudinal strain has been shown to
have incremental prognostic value. [325][,][326] The use of 3D echocardiography, CMR and exercise echocardiography may help to identify
patients with severe mitral regurgitation when 2D echocardiography
at rest is inconclusive. [24][,][268]

c If an elevated SPAP is the only indication for surgery, the value should be confirmed by invasive measurement.
d Cut-offs refer to average-size adults and may require adaptations in patients
with unusually small or large stature.

6.1.3 Medical therapy
In acute mitral regurgitation, nitrates and diuretics are used to reduce
filling pressures. Sodium nitroprusside reduces afterload and regurgitant fraction. Inotropic agents and an intra-aortic balloon pump are of
use in hypotension and haemodynamic instability.
In chronic PMR with preserved LVEF, there is no evidence to support
the prophylactic use of vasodilators. In patients with overt heart failure,
medical treatment as per current heart failure guidelines applies. [247]

6.1.4 Serial testing
Asymptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation and LVEF
>60% should be followed clinically and by echocardiography every 6
months, ideally in the setting of a Heart Valve Centre. [309] Measurement
of BNP levels, exercise echocardiography, electrocardiogram-Holter
monitoring and CMR are useful complementary diagnostic and risk
stratification tools. [268] The association between PMR, sudden cardiac
death and ventricular arrhythmias remains controversial. [310][�][312] The
presence of mitral annulus disjunction (abnormal atrial displacement of
the hinge point of the mitral valve away from the ventricular myocardium) has been also associated with increased risk of ventricular
arrhythmias. [310][,][311][,][313] Interestingly, the majority of these patients did
not have severe mitral regurgitation. In asymptomatic patients with
severe PMR and progressive increase of LV size (LVESD approaching
40 mm) or decrease of LVEF on serial studies, surgical mitral valve
repair should be discussed. Asymptomatic patients with moderate
mitral regurgitation and preserved LV function can be followed on a
yearly basis and echocardiography should be performed every
1�2 years. After intervention, serial follow-up focuses on evaluation
of symptomatic status, presence of arrhythmic events, assessment of
valve function, [314] and recurrence of mitral regurgitation. After surgical
mitral valve repair, high-volume centres have reported good durability
with a recurrence rate of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation of
12.5% at 20 years of follow-up. [296] After transcatheter mitral valve
repair, the currently reported rates of residual moderate and severe

�
mitral regurgitation (23 30%) would suggest that yearly echocardiogram is appropriate. [14][,][300][,][301]

6.2.2 Medical therapy
Optimal medical therapy in line with the guidelines for the management of heart failure [247] should be the first and essential step in the
management of all patients with SMR and should include replacement
of ACEI or ARB with sacubitril/valsartan, sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and/or ivabradine, whenever indicated. [247][,][327]

Indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) should be
evaluated in accordance with related guidelines. [247] If symptoms persist
after optimization of conventional heart failure therapy, options for
mitral valve intervention should be promptly evaluated before further
deterioration of LV systolic function or cardiac remodelling occur.

multidisciplinary Heart Team needs to be emphasized in this setting.
The Heart Team, including a heart failure specialist, should optimize
guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and consider the indications of electrophysiological, transcatheter and surgical interventions,
their priority and order of implementation.

The evidence supporting surgical intervention remains limited.
Mitral valve surgery is recommended in patients with severe SMR
undergoing CABG or other cardiac surgery. [329][,][330] The surgical
approach has to be tailored to the individual patient. [247][,][331] In selected
patients without advanced LV remodelling, mitral valve repair with an
undersized complete rigid ring restores valve competence, improves
symptoms, and results in reverse LV remodelling. [331] Additional valvular/subvalvular techniques or chordal sparing valve replacement may
be considered in patients with echocardiographic predictors of repair
failure. [332] Valve replacement avoids recurrence of mitral regurgitation, although this does not translate into better LV reverse

in SMR are particularly restrictive, owing to significant procedural
risk, high rates of recurrent mitral regurgitation, and the absence of
proven survival benefit. [333][�][335] In patients with atrial functional mitral

low. Exercise-induced dyspnoea and a large increase in mitral regurgitation severity and SPAP favour combined surgery.

Transcatheter mitral valve repair systems other than TEER, as well
as transcatheter mitral valve replacement devices, are currently the
subject of intense investigation but clinical data are still limited.

TEER with the MitraClip system is a minimal-invasive treatment
option for SMR. Two RCTs (COAPT and MITRA-FR) [323][,][336][,][337] have
evaluated its safety and efficacy in patients with symptomatic heart
failure and severe SMR persisting despite medical therapy, who were
considered either ineligible or not appropriate for surgery by the
[Heart Team (Supplementary Table 7). The results indicate that the](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data)
procedure is safe and effectively reduces SMR up to 3 years. [338]

However, in the MITRA-FR trial, [323][,][336] MitraClip implantation had no
impact on the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or heart failure
hospitalization at 12 months and 2 years compared to GDMT alone.
In the COAPT trial, [337] MitraClip implantation substantially reduced
the primary endpoint of cumulative hospitalizations for heart failure,
as well as several pre-specified secondary endpoints, including allcause mortality at 2 years.

Subanalyses of the COAPT trial confirm the positive response to
TEER in several patient subgroups; [339][�][343] conversely, the effect of
the interventional treatment was neutral throughout all subgroups in
an echocardiographic subanalyses of the MITRA-FR trial. [344]

The conflicting results of these two trials have generated considerable discussion. These diverging results might be partially explained
by effect size of the trials, differences in trial design, patient selection,
echocardiographic assessment of SMR severity, use of medical therapy, and technical factors. Patients in COAPT demonstrated greater
severity of SMR (EROA 41±15 mm [2] vs. 31±10 mm [2] ) and less LV dilatation (mean indexed LV end-diastolic volume 101±34 mL/m [2] vs.
135±35 mL/m [2] ) than those enrolled in MITRA-FR. Perhaps reflecting
greater severity of SMR in relation to LV dimensions (‘disproportionate’ mitral regurgitation), patients in COAPT were overall more likely
to benefit from TEER in terms of reduced mortality and heart failure
hospitalization. [345]

Additional studies are needed to identify patients who will benefit

the most from TEER.

Therefore, TEER should be considered in selected patients with
severe SMR fulfilling the COAPT inclusion criteria, [346][�][348] who receive
optimal medical therapy supervised by a heart failure specialist and are
as close as possible to the patients actually enrolled in the study.
Optimization of the procedural result should also be pursued. In addition, TEER may be considered only in selected cases when the
COAPT criteria are not fulfilled with the aim of improving symptoms
and quality of life. [349][�][353] In patients with less severe SMR (EROA
<30 mm [2] ) and advanced LV dilatation/dysfunction, the prognostic benefit of MitraClip remains unproven. [323][,][354][,][355] Patients with end-stage
LV and/or RV failure and no option for revascularization may be better
served by cardiac transplantation or LV assist device implantation.
Valve intervention is generally not an option when LVEF is <15%. [247]

The management of moderate ischaemic SMR in patients undergoing CABG remains an object of debate. [322][,][330] Surgery is more likely
to be considered if myocardial viability is present and if comorbidity is

### 7 Mitral stenosis

Aetiology of mitral stenosis is mostly rheumatic or degenerative.

Rheumatic fever is the most common cause of mitral stenosis world
wide. Its prevalence has greatly decreased in industrialized countries,
but it remains a significant healthcare problem in developing countries and affects young patients. [2][,][267][,][358] Degenerative mitral stenosis
related to MAC is a distinct pathology and its prevalence significantly
increases with age. [359][,][360] Both types of mitral stenosis are more frequent in females. [361] In rare cases, mitral stenosis due to valve rigidity
but without commissural fusion, may be related to chest radiation,

carcinoid heart disease, or inherited metabolic diseases.

7.1 Rheumatic mitral stenosis

7.1.1 Evaluation

Clinically significant mitral stenosis is defined by a mitral valve
area (MVA) <_1.5 cm [2] . Commissural fusion with thickening of the posterior leaflet is the most important mechanism of stenosis.
Echocardiography is the preferred method for diagnosis, assessment of
severity, and haemodynamic consequences of mitral stenosis. Valve
area using 2D planimetry is the reference measurement of mitral stenosis severity, whereas mean transvalvular gradient and pulmonary pressures reflect its consequences and have a prognostic role. [362] 3D-TTE
planimetry may have an additional diagnostic value. TTE usually provides sufficient information for routine management. Scoring systems
have been developed to help assess suitability for percutaneous mitral
[commissurotomy (PMC; Supplementary Table 8),](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data) [363][�][365] TOE should
be performed to exclude LA thrombus before PMC or after an embolic
episode, and to obtain detailed information on mitral anatomy (commissural zones and subvalvular apparatus) before intervention when
TTE is suboptimal. Stress testing is indicated in patients with no symptoms or symptoms equivocal or discordant with the severity of mitral
stenosis. Exercise echocardiography may provide objective information
by assessing changes in mitral gradient and pulmonary artery pressure
and is superior to DSE. Echocardiography plays an important role in
the periprocedural monitoring of PMC and follow-up.

7.1.2 Indications for intervention

The type of treatment (PMC or surgery), as well as its timing, should
be decided based on clinical characteristics, anatomy of valve and
subvalvular apparatus, and local expertise. [366][�][369] In general, indication for intervention should be limited to patients with clinically significant (moderate-to-severe) rheumatic mitral stenosis (valve area
<_1.5 cm [2] ) in whom PMC has had a significant impact on its manage
ment. In Western countries where incidence of rheumatic fever and

number of PMC is low, this treatment should be restricted to expert
operators in specialized centres to improve safety and procedural
success rate. [366] Efforts should be made to increase availability of
PMC in developing countries where access to treatment is limited
due to economic reasons. [267] PMC should be considered as an initial

treatment for selected patients with mild to moderate calcification or
impaired subvalvular apparatus, but who have otherwise favourable
clinical characteristics. [360]

The management of clinically significant rheumatic mitral stenosis is
summarized in Figure 7 and the indications and contraindications for
PMC are provided in the table of recommendations below, and Table 8.

Diuretics, beta-blockers, digoxin, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and ivabradine can improve symptoms. Anticoagulation
with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) with a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is indicated in patients with AF.

Patients with moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis and AF should be

kept on VKA and not receive NOACs. Currently there is no solid
evidence to support the use of NOACs in this setting [370] and a
randomized clinical trial is underway (INVICTUS VKA NCT
02832544). Neither cardioversion nor catheter pulmonary vein

isolation are indicated before intervention in patients with significant
mitral stenosis, as they do not durably restore sinus rhythm. If AF is
of recent onset and the LA is only moderately enlarged, cardioversion should be performed soon after successful intervention, it
should also be considered in patients with less than severe mitral
stenosis. Amiodarone is most effective in maintaining the sinus
rhythm after cardioversion. In patients in sinus rhythm, OAC is recommended when there has been a history of systemic embolism or a
thrombus is present in the LA and should also be considered when
TOE shows dense spontaneous echocardiographic contrast or an
enlarged LA (M-mode diameter >50 mm or LA volume >60 mL/m [2] ).

**596** ESC/EACTS Guidelines


7.1.4 Serial testing
Asymptomatic patients with clinically significant mitral stenosis
should be followed up yearly by clinical and echocardiographic

�
examinations; and at longer intervals (2 3 years) in case of moderate
stenosis. Follow-up of patients after successful PMC is similar to that
of asymptomatic patients and should be more frequent if asympto
matic restenosis occurs.

7.1.5 Special patient populations
When symptomatic restenosis occurs after surgical commissurotomy or PMC, re-intervention in most cases requires valve replacement, but PMC can be proposed in selected candidates with
favourable characteristics if the predominant mechanism is commissural refusion. [369]

In patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis combined with
severe aortic valve disease, surgery is preferable when it is not contraindicated. The management of patients in whom surgery is contraindicated is difficult and requires a comprehensive and individualized
evaluation by the Heart Team. In cases with severe mitral stenosis
associated with moderate aortic valve disease, PMC can be performed to postpone the surgical treatment of both valves. In patients
with severe tricuspid regurgitation, PMC may be considered in
selected patients with sinus rhythm, moderate atrial enlargement,
and severe functional tricuspid regurgitation secondary to pulmonary
hypertension. In other cases, surgery on both valves is preferred. [371]

In the elderly population with rheumatic mitral stenosis when surgery is high risk, PMC is a useful option, even if as palliative
care. [364][,][367][,][368] Treatment of patients with low-gradient severe mitral
stenosis (MVA <_1.5 cm [2], mean gradient <10 mmHg) is difficult, as
these patients are older and have less optimal anatomy. [372]

7.2 Degenerative mitral stenosis with
mitral annular calcification

MAC is a distinct entity that differs from rheumatic mitral stenosis.
Usually, these patients are elderly and may have significant comorbidities including disease of other valves. Overall, the prognosis is poor
due to high-risk profile and technical anatomic challenges resulting
from the presence of annular calcification. [373] Between 9% and 15%
of the general population may have MAC, with higher frequency in
elderly patients (40%). [67][,][374][�][376] Furthermore, almost half of patients
with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI have MAC, and the disease is
severe in 9.5% of cases. [359][,][377] Severe MAC may result in mitral stenosis (more frequently) or mitral regurgitation, or both.

7.2.1 Evaluation

In patients with degenerative mitral stenosis and MAC, the echocardiographic evaluation of the disease severity is difficult and the usual
parameters lack validation. Planimetry is less reliable due to diffuse
calcium and irregular orifice. The mean transmitral gradient has been
shown to have prognostic value. [378] For the evaluation of severity, it is
necessary to take into account the abnormalities of LA and LV compliance before indicating an intervention. If an intervention is planned,
echocardiography is used for initial evaluation and CCT is necessary
to assess the degree and location of calcification and to evaluate the

[379] . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


7.2.2 Indications for intervention

Treatment options, including transcatheter and surgical approaches,
are high-risk procedures and evidence from randomized trials is lacking. Even if the procedure is done successfully and the transvalvular
gradient is reduced, due to low compliance of the LA and LV the
mean atrial pressure may remain elevated.
In elderly patients with degenerative mitral stenosis and MAC, surgery is technically challenging and high risk. [380] As there is no commissural fusion, degenerative mitral stenosis is not amenable to PMC. [359]

In symptomatic inoperable patients with suitable anatomy, preliminary experience showed that transcatheter mitral valve implantation
(in mitral position, using an inverted balloon-expandable TAVI prosthesis), is feasible in selected patients with severe mitral stenosis,
when performed by experienced operators after careful preplanning using multimodality imaging. [379] The largest case series
reported to date included only 116 patients. [381] However, operative
mortality is high, in particular due to the risk of LVOT obstruction
and mid-term results are less favourable compared to mitral valve-invalve procedures. [382][,][383] The most recent case series show that
results are improving owing to better patient selection and the use of
different accesses, as well as concomitant or preventive measures
such as alcohol septal ablation [384] or laceration/resection of the anterior leaflet. [385][�][387]

Recently, a preliminary case series suggested that transcatheter
mitral valve replacement using a dedicated prosthesis is feasible and
can result in symptom improvement. [388]
### 8 Tricuspid regurgitation

Moderate or severe tricuspid regurgitation is observed in 0.55% of
the general population and its prevalence increases with age, affecting
about 4% of the patients aged 75 years or more. [389] Aetiology is secondary in >_90% of cases, due to pressure and/or volume overload
mediated RV dilatation or enlarged right atrium and tricuspid annulus
due to chronic AF. Secondary tricuspid regurgitation is associated
with left-sided valvular or myocardial dysfunction in most cases,
whereas it is isolated in 8.1% of subjects and independently related to
mortality. [389] Secondary tricuspid regurgitation may also develop late
after left-sided valve surgery. [390][,][391]

Causes of primary tricuspid regurgitation include infective endocarditis [especially in intravenous (i.v.) drug addicts], rheumatic heart
disease, carcinoid syndrome, myxomatous disease, endomyocardial
fibrosis, congenital valve dysplasia (e.g. Ebstein’s anomaly), thoracic
trauma, and iatrogenic valve damage.
Atrial fibrillation induces annular remodelling even in the absence
of left-heart disease. [392] Cardiac implantable electronic device-lead
implantation leads to progressive tricuspid regurgitation in 20�30%
of the patients [393][�][395] and predicts its progression over time. [396]

In patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF, secondary tricuspid regurgitation is a very frequent finding and is an independent predictor of clinical outcomes. [397]

8.1 Evaluation

Tricuspid regurgitation should be evaluated first by echocardiography. In primary tricuspid regurgitation, specific abnormalities of the
valve can be identified. In secondary tricuspid regurgitation, annular

dilatation, along with RV and right atrium dimensions, as well as RV
function should be measured, owing to their prognostic relevance. [398]

In experienced laboratories, RV strain [27] and/or 3D measurements of
RV volumes [399][,][400] may be considered to overcome the existing limitations of conventional RV function indices. [102] When available, CMR
is the preferred method to assess the RV [400] due to its high accuracy
and reproducibility. [401]

Echocardiographic evaluation of tricuspid regurgitation severity is
based on an integrative approach considering multiple qualitative and
quantitative parameters (Table 9). Due to the non-circular and nonplanar shape of the regurgitant orifice, biplane vena contracta width

should be considered in addition to the conventional 2D measurement. [402] Similarly, underestimation of tricuspid regurgitation severity
by the PISA method may occur. [403] In case of inconsistent findings, the
3D vena contracta area may be evaluated, although diverging cut-offs
have been reported. [402][,][404][�][406] Recently, a new grading scheme
including two additional grades (‘massive’ and ‘torrential’) has been
proposed [407] and used in clinical studies on transcatheter interventions. [408][,][409] Studies showed an incremental prognostic value of the
two additional grades (massive and torrential) in terms of mortality
and rehospitalization for heart failure in patients with advanced
disease. [410][�][412]

Alternatively, calculation of the tricuspid regurgitant volume by
CMR using RV volumetry may be helpful.
Importantly, estimation of pulmonary pressures using Doppler gradient may be impossible or might underestimate the severity of pulmonary hypertension in the presence of severe tricuspid
regurgitation, justifying cardiac catheterization to evaluate pulmonary
vascular resistances. [413]

Table 9 Echocardiographic criteria for grading severity
of tricuspid regurgitation







8.2 Indications for intervention

Severe tricuspid regurgitation is associated with impaired
survival [389][,][414][�][416] and worsening heart failure. [397][,][417] In clinical practice, tricuspid valve interventions are underused and often initiated
too late. [418][�][420] Appropriate timing of intervention is crucial to avoid
irreversible RV damage and organ failure with subsequent increased
surgical risk [421][,][422] (see table of recommendations on indications for
intervention in tricuspid valve disease in section 9 and Figure 8).

Surgery is recommended in symptomatic patients with severe primary tricuspid regurgitation. In selected asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients who are appropriate for surgery, an intervention
should also be considered when RV dilatation or declining RV function
is observed. However, exact thresholds have not yet been defined.
According to observational data, tricuspid valve repair should be
performed liberally during left-sided surgery in patients with secondary tricuspid regurgitation. Indeed, it does not increase operative
risk, but promotes reverse remodelling of the RV and improves functional status when annular dilatation is present, even in the absence
of severe tricuspid regurgitation. [423][�][427]

The benefit of surgical correction of isolated secondary tricuspid
regurgitation compared to medical treatment is not well established [428]

and the procedure has a non-negligible risk of periprocedural mortality
and morbidity when patients present late. [429][�][432] However, in carefully
selected candidates, surgery can be performed safely with good longterm survival. [418][,][433] It should therefore be considered early in selected
symptomatic patients appropriate for surgery, as well as in those with
no or mild symptoms, RV dilatation and severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Although a tricuspid annular pulmonary systolic excursion (TAPSE)
<17 mm has been associated with worse prognosis in patients with
secondary tricuspid regurgitation, [398][,][434] thresholds for severe RV dysfunction making intervention futile have not yet been defined.

Reoperation on the tricuspid valve in new-onset or worsening secondary tricuspid regurgitation after left-sided surgery carries a high
procedural risk, possibly due to late referral and subsequent poor
clinical condition. [435] To improve prognosis, treatment of severe tricuspid regurgitation in this challenging scenario should be considered
even in asymptomatic patients if there are signs of RV dilatation or
decline in RV function (after exclusion of left-sided valve dysfunction,
severe RV or LV dysfunction and severe pulmonary vascular disease/
hypertension).

Whenever possible, annuloplasty with prosthetic rings is preferable to valve replacement, [423][,][430][,][436] which should only be considered
when the tricuspid valve leaflets are tethered and the annulus
severely dilated. In presence of a cardiac implantable electronic
device lead, the technique used should be adapted to the patient’s
condition and the surgeon’s experience. [437]

TTVI are under clinical development. Early registry and study data
demonstrated the feasibility to reduce tricuspid regurgitation using
various systems, enabling either leaflet approximation, [408][,][438][�][440]

direct annuloplasty, [409][,][441] or valve replacement, [442][�][444] with subsequent symptomatic and haemodynamic improvement. [445][,][446] In a
propensity-score-matched study comparing medical treatment to
TTVI, all-cause mortality and rehospitalizations at 1 year were lower
among the patients who received the interventional treatment. [447]

Several RCTs will investigate the efficacy of TTVI against medical

treatment.

Therefore, TTVI may be considered by the Heart Team at experienced Heart Valve Centres in symptomatic, inoperable, anatomically
eligible patients in whom symptomatic or prognostic improvement
can be expected. For detailed anatomical evaluation, TOE and CCT
may be preferred owing to higher spatial resolution. [448][,][449]

8.3 Medical therapy
Diuretics are useful in the presence of right heart failure. To counterbalance the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
associated with hepatic congestion, the addition of an aldosterone
antagonist may be considered. [247] Dedicated treatment of pulmonary
hypertension is indicated in specific cases. Although data are limited,
rhythm control may help to decrease tricuspid regurgitation and . [.....................................]


contain annular dilatation in patients with chronic AF. [450] Importantly,
in the absence of advanced RV dysfunction or severe pulmonary
hypertension, none of the above-mentioned therapies should delay
referral for surgery or transcatheter therapy.
### 9 Tricuspid stenosis

Tricuspid stenosis is often combined with tricuspid regurgitation and
most frequently of rheumatic origin. It is therefore usually associated
with left-sided valve lesions, particularly mitral stenosis. Other causes
are rare, including congenital, carcinoid and drug-induced valve diseases, Whipple’s disease, endocarditis, and large right atrial tumour.

ESC/EACTS Guidelines **599**


9.1 Evaluation

Echocardiography provides the most useful information. Tricuspid
stenosis is often overlooked and requires careful evaluation.
Echocardiographic evaluation of valve anatomy and subvalvular apparatus is important to assess valve reparability. No generally accepted
grading of tricuspid stenosis severity exists, but a mean echocardiographic transvalvular gradient >_5 mmHg at normal heart rate is considered indicative of significant tricuspid stenosis. [362]

9.2 Indications for intervention

Intervention on the tricuspid valve is usually performed concomitantly during procedures for left-sided valve disease in patients who
are symptomatic despite medical therapy. Although the lack of pliable
leaflet tissue is a main limitation for valve repair, the choice between
repair and replacement depends on anatomy and surgical expertise.
Owing to satisfactory long-term durability, biological prostheses are
usually preferred over mechanical valves, which have a high risk of
thrombosis. [451]

Percutaneous tricuspid balloon valvuloplasty has been performed

in a limited number of cases, either alone or in combination with

PMC. It frequently induces significant regurgitation and long-term
results are lacking. [452] It can be considered in rare cases with anatomically suitable valves, when tricuspid stenosis is isolated or additional
mitral stenosis can also be treated interventionally (see recommendations on indications for PMC and mitral valve surgery in clinically
significant mitral stenosis in section 7).

9.3 Medical therapy
Diuretics are useful in the presence of heart failure symptoms but are
of limited long-term efficacy.
### 10 Combined and multiple-valve diseases

Significant stenosis and regurgitation can be found on the same
valve. Disease of multiple valves may be encountered in several
conditions, particularly in rheumatic and congenital heart disease,
but also less frequently in degenerative valve disease. There is a
lack of data on combined or multiple-valve disease. [453][�][460] This
does not allow for evidence-based recommendations. The general
principles for the management of combined or multiple-valve dis
ease are as follows:

 - [When either stenosis or regurgitation is predominant, man-]

agement follows the recommendations concerning the predominant VHD. When the severity of both stenosis and
regurgitation is balanced, indications for interventions should
be based on symptoms and objective consequences rather
than on the indices of severity of stenosis or regurgitation. [453][�][456] In this setting, Doppler pressure gradient
reflects the global haemodynamic burden (stenosis and regurgitation) of the valve lesion. [453]

 - [Besides the separate assessment of each valve lesion, it is nec-]

essary to consider the interaction between the different valve
lesions. As an illustration, associated mitral regurgitation may

lead to underestimation of the severity of aortic stenosis, as
decreased stroke volume due to mitral regurgitation lowers
the flow across the aortic valve and hence the aortic gradient. [453] This underlines the need to combine different meas
urements, including assessment of valve areas, if possible using
methods that are less dependent on loading conditions, such
as planimetry. [457]

 - [Indications for intervention are based on global assessment of]

the consequences of the different valve lesions (i.e. symptoms or
presence of LV dilatation or dysfunction). Intervention can be
considered for non-severe multiple lesions associated with symptoms or leading to LV impairment. [453]

 - [The decision to intervene on multiple valves should take into]

account the age, comorbidities, and risk of combined procedures,
and should be made by the Heart Team after precise and comprehensive evaluation of valve lesions and their interactions with
each other. [453][,][461] The risk of combined intervention should be

weighed against the evolution of untreated valve disease and the
inherent risk of subsequent intervention.

 - [The choice of surgical technique/interventional procedure]

should take into account the presence of the other
VHD. [453][,][458][,][459][,][461]

 - [When interventional procedures are considered, staged proce-]

dures may be preferable in cases with aortic stenosis and mitral
regurgitation (see section 5.5). Improved 1-year survival after
combined transcatheter treatment of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has been reported compared to mitral regurgitation
alone. [263] PMC may delay surgery, in situations such as severe
mitral stenosis associated with moderate aortic regurgitation.

individual sections of this document.

mortality than those with a mechanical heart valve (MHV). An analysis of patients 55 to 64 years of age showed no difference in mortality
between aortic BHV and MHV prosthesis. [462] However, an earlier
systematic review [463] and a recent meta-analysis [464] of studies comparing aortic MHVs and BHVs showed a significant mortality reduc
�
tion with MHVs in patients <_60 and in those 50 70 years of age,
respectively. All these studies are limited by their predominantly
observational nature and missing information on the type of prostheses implanted. There is no new high-quality evidence supporting a
decrease in the established age cut-off for prosthesis selection.

The best aortic valve substitute for younger adults remains
unclear. In appropriately selected patients, replacement of the aortic
valve using an autograft may be performed, with long-term survival
rates and valve-related reoperation that are comparable to those
achieved with a MHV, but high expertise in aortic root surgery is
required. [465] Strategies for patients with small aortic annulus include
root enlargement and use of stentless valves. Although the use of
sutureless and rapid-deployment aortic valves may reduce invasiveness, cross-clamp and cardiopulmonary bypass times, and potentially
lower perioperative complications of SAVR, there is a lack of a largescale randomized comparison on both short- and long-term safety,
efficacy, and haemodynamic performance of this approach against

are substantially increased up to 6 months. [477][,][478] Long-term prevention of valve thrombosis and thromboembolism after MHV implanta
tion involves effective antithrombotic medication and risk factor
modification for thromboembolism. [479]

11.3.1.2 Target international normalized ratio
Target INR should be based upon prosthesis thrombogenicity and
patient-related risk factors (Table 10). [479] It is recommended to target
a median INR value rather than a range to avoid considering extreme
values in the target range as a valid target INR. High INR variability is
a strong independent predictor of adverse events after valve replacement. Although some studies have supported lowering a target INR
for aortic MHVs, [480][,][481] further evaluation in larger cohorts is warranted before updating current recommendations. The use of selfmonitoring INR is associated with a lower rate of VKA-related complications in all ages. [482] In a trial of lower intensity warfarin plus

�
aspirin (INR 1.5 2.0) or standard warfarin plus aspirin (INR
2.0�3.0) after implantation of the On-X MHV in the aortic position,
the similar safety of the two approaches was partly attributed to use
of home INR monitoring and high degree of adherence among
patients. [481] Patient’s education plays an important role for achieving
stable anticoagulation in the therapeutic range. Effective management
of patients with unstable INR requires frequent in-clinic testing and
dose titration. Because of the lack of good-quality evidence, pharmacogenetic testing cannot be recommended to guide the dosing of

VKAs.

11.3.1.3 Management of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) overdose and
bleeding
Bleeding increases exponentially with INR >4.5. [483] In case of major
and/or life-threatening bleeding and in patients who need to undergo
urgent surgery, the VKA should be discontinued and 10 mg vitamin K
should be administrated by slow i.v. infusion and repeated every 12 h
if needed. Until the anticoagulation effect is reversed, administration
of prothrombin complex concentration (PCC) and/or fresh frozen
plasma (FFP) therapy should be initiated according to body weight
and pre-treatment INR. The efficacy should be monitored by recheck of INR at 30 min and every 4�6 h until normalization. The
optimal time to restart anticoagulation should be discussed in relation
to location of the bleeding event and interventions performed to
stop bleeding and/or to treat an underlying cause. [484]


11.2 Baseline assessment and follow-up
All patients with prosthetic valves require lifelong follow-up to detect
early deterioration in prosthetic function or ventricular function, or
progressive disease of another heart valve. [314] Clinical assessment
should be performed yearly or as soon as possible if new cardiac
symptoms occur. TTE should be performed if any new symptoms
occur or if complications are suspected. After transcatheter, as well
as surgical implantation of a BHV, echocardiography, including measurement of transprosthetic gradients, should be performed within
30 days after valve implantation (i.e. baseline), at 1 year, and annually
thereafter. [470] TOE should be considered if TTE is of poor quality and
in all cases of suspected prosthetic dysfunction (especially if the prosthesis is in the mitral position) or endocarditis. [314][,][471] Cinefluoroscopy
for MHVs and CCT scanning provide useful additional information if
valve thrombus or pannus are suspected to impair valve function. [314]

11.3 Antithrombotic management
11.3.1 Mechanical prostheses
11.3.1.1 Postoperative anticoagulation management
MHVs require lifelong treatment with VKA guided by the INR. [472][,][473]

NOACs currently have no role in patients with MHVs. [474] Treatment
with VKA should be started on the first postoperative day in combination with bridging therapy [with therapeutic doses of either unfractionated heparin (UFH) or off-label use of low-molecular-weight
heparin (LMWH)] until therapeutic INR is achieved. [475] Similar safety
and efficacy outcomes have been reported following bridging with
either UFH or LMWH. [476] Once a stable therapeutic INR is reached
for >_24 h, bridging can be discontinued. The postoperative risk of
thromboembolism peaks about 1 month after implantation, but risks


. [.............................................................................................]

**602** ESC/EACTS Guidelines


In the absence of bleeding, the use of PCC and/or FFP therapy is

not recommended and the decision to start vitamin K should be indi
vidualized. In asymptomatic patients with INR >10, the VKA must be

�
stopped and oral vitamin K (2.5 5 mg) prescribed, while the INR
must be monitored on a daily base for 2 weeks. Multiple RCTs in
patients with INR between 4.5 and 10 suggest no difference in bleeding events with vitamin K vs. placebo. [483][,][485] Therefore, in such
patients, warfarin should be stopped temporarily, and a small dose of

�
oral vitamin K (1 2 mg) can be considered on an individual basis balancing between the risks. Finally, asymptomatic patients with INR
<4.5 require careful down-titration and/or skipping one or more
doses. In all patients with MHVs, VKAs must be resumed once the
INR achieves the therapeutic range or is slightly elevated.

11.3.1.4 Combination of oral anticoagulation (OAC) with antiplatelet
drugs

�
The addition of low-dose (75 100 mg) acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)
to VKA may reduce the incidence of thromboembolism at the
cost of bleeding. [477] Therefore, addition of antiplatelets to VKAs
should be reserved for patients at very high risk of thromboembolism where advantages clearly outweigh the risks. [486][,][487] In patients
with thromboembolism despite adequate INR, low dose

�
(75 100 mg) ASA should be added to VKAs. Management of oral
antithrombotic therapy in patients with CAD is summarized in
[Supplementary Figure 2.](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data)

11.3.1.5 Interruption of anticoagulant therapy for planned invasive
procedures
In patients with MHVs, preoperative bridging with UFH or LMWH
before surgery imposes a risk of perioperative bleeding while interrupting anticoagulation results in an increased risk of thromboembo
[488] . [...............................................................................................]


Transcatheter bioprostheses: A meta-analysis of three small RCTs
showed a significant increase in major or life-threatening bleeding
with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) over ASA at 30 days, with no
difference in ischaemic outcomes. [495] Consistently, the more recent
POPular TAVI trial (cohort A) found reduced bleeding and the composite of bleeding or thromboembolic events with ASA compared
with DAPT. [496] A randomized trial was halted prematurely due to
safety concerns with a rivaroxaban-based regimen as compared with
DAPT, including a higher risk of death or thromboembolic complications and a higher risk of bleeding. [497] There is a lack of data on the
management of antithrombotic therapy after implantation of transcatheter mitral BHVs (e.g. valve-in-valve or valve-in-ring) for which 3
months of VKA is commonly prescribed. [498]

11.3.2.2 Patients with baseline indication to oral anticoagulation (OAC)
Surgical bioprostheses: OAC is recommended lifelong for patients
with surgical BHVs who have other indications for anticoagulation.
The evidence supporting the use of NOACs in preference to VKA
has increased since the publication of the 2017 VHD Guidelines. In
the RIVER trial, including patients with AF and a BHV in the mitral
position, the NOAC rivaroxaban was non-inferior to warfarin with
respect to a net benefit endpoint at 12 months. [499] The benefit of
NOAC was consistent among subgroups. However, only 20% of
patients were enrolled in the trial before the third postoperative

month, which raises a note of caution and calls for additional data in

this particular subgroup. In the small ENAVLE trial (N = 220), including patients with and without AF, edoxaban was non-inferior to warfarin for preventing thromboembolism and the occurrence of major
bleeding in the first 3 months after aortic or mitral surgical bioprosthetic valve implantation or repair, which warrants confirmation in
larger investigations. [500]


11.3.1.4 Combination of oral anticoagulation (OAC) with antiplatelet
drugs

The addition of low-dose (75 100 mg) acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)
to VKA may reduce the incidence of thromboembolism at the

11.3.1.5 Interruption of anticoagulant therapy for planned invasive
procedures
In patients with MHVs, preoperative bridging with UFH or LMWH
before surgery imposes a risk of perioperative bleeding while interrupting anticoagulation results in an increased risk of thromboembolism. [488] Therefore, anticoagulation in patients with MHVs undergoing
elective NCS requires careful management by multidisciplinary consensus. [478][,][489] For minor surgical procedures (e.g. dental, cataract,
skin incision) in which blood loss is usually small and easily controlled,
it is recommended that OAC is not interrupted. Major surgeries
require temporary interruption and therapeutic bridging with either
[UFH or LMWH, aiming for an INR <1.5 (Supplementary Figure 3).](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab395#supplementary-data)
Fondaparinux should not be routinely used for bridging, but
may have a role in patients with history of heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia. [490]



Recommendations for management of antithrombotic
therapy after prosthetic valve implantation or valve
repair in the perioperative and postoperative periods






11.3.2 Bioprostheses
11.3.2.1 Patients with no baseline indication to oral anticoagulation
(OAC)
Surgical bioprostheses: The optimal antithrombotic strategy early
after surgical implantation of an aortic BHV remains controversial
due to lack of high-quality evidence. Multiple observational studies
support the use of VKAs to reduce the risk of
thromboembolism. [491][�][493] A small randomized trial found that VKA

for 3 months significantly increased major bleeding compared with
ASA, without reducing the rate of deaths or thromboembolic events,
but the statistical power was low for demonstrating a thrombotic
benefit. [494] VKA for 3 months should be considered in all patients
with a mitral or tricuspid BHV and ASA or VKA should be considered
for 3 months after surgical implantation of an aortic bioprosthesis.

Transcatheter bioprostheses: In the POPular TAVI trial (cohort B),
the incidence of bleeding over a period of 1 month or 1 year was
lower with OAC than with OAC plus clopidogrel. [501] OAC alone
was non-inferior to OAC plus clopidogrel with respect to ischaemic
events, but the non-inferiority margin was large. An observational
study suggested that there is a higher risk of ischaemic events at
1 year with NOACs compared with VKAs, after adjustment for
potential confounders. [502] Randomized trials comparing NOACs vs.
VKAs are ongoing (NCT02943785, NCT02664649). Data on the
management of antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter mitral or
tricuspid valve implantation are scant. [498]

11.3.3 Valve repair
Observational data suggest comparable risk of thromboembolism
with ASA or VKAs following mitral valve repair, [503] but randomized
data are lacking. The high incidence of new-onset AF and its recurrence, the thrombogenic tendency of the non-endothelialized repair
components, and a relatively high rate of patients who are resistant
to ASA establish VKAs as a preferable option for the initial period . [..........................................................]


(e.g. 3 months). However, the potential for bleeding complications in
the postoperative phase dictates careful patient selection.

The management of antithrombotic treatment after prosthetic
valve implantation or valve repair is summarized in the table of recommendations for management of antithrombotic therapy after
prosthetic valve implantation or valve repair and in Figure 9.

dysfunction and complications

11.4.1 Structural valve deterioration

Definitions of SVD and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) were standardized by recent consensus. [470][,][522] The comparative durability of
TAVI and SAVR BHVs must be ascertained at longer term.
Reversible causes of BVF (e.g. endocarditis, thrombosis) should be
excluded, and considerations on timing of dysfunction (e.g. for BHV
obstruction, mismatch in early phases, thrombosis in later phases)
and location of malfunction (e.g. endocarditis or SVD in case of central regurgitation, endocarditis or anatomical/technical factors in case

of paravalvular regurgitation) may reveal the most plausible underlying cause and guide clinical decision making.

Percutaneous balloon interventions should be avoided in the treat
ment of stenotic left-sided bioprostheses. Transcatheter valve-in-valve
implantation is an option for treating degenerated BHVs in patients
with increased surgical risk. [227][,][523][�][525] Redo-TAVI is a safe and feasible
option in selected patients, but the risk of PPM in small valves and that
of coronary occlusion, as well the possibility for future access to the
coronary arteries need to be considered. [229][,][526][�][528] Experience is
mostly in aortic BHVs and remains limited for BHVs in the mitral position and even more so in the tricuspid position [529][�][532] for which valvein-valve procedures may be reasonable in patients at increased surgical
risk. [531][,][533] Valve-in-ring mitral procedures are also acceptable in
selected candidates, while the role of valve-in-ring tricuspid procedures
remains uncertain. It is necessary for the Heart Team to discuss every
patient and choose the best individualized approach. Careful preprocedural planning is needed to minimize the risk of coronary artery
obstruction and enable future coronary re-access in aortic BHV reinterventions if necessary. For mitral re-interventions the risk of LVOT
obstruction should be carefully evaluated. [534]

11.4.2 Non-structural valve dysfunction
11.4.2.1 Patient-prosthesis mismatch
Patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) significantly decreases long-term

survival, correlates with SVD and increases readmission rates for
both heart failure and reoperation. [535][�][537] Efforts to prevent PPM
should receive more emphasis to improve long-term survival after
either SAVR or TAVI. [538]

11.4.2.2 Paravalvular leak and haemolysis
Blood tests for haemolysis should be part of routine follow-up after
valve replacement. Diagnosis of haemolytic anaemia requires TOE to
detect paravalvular leaks for prostheses in the mitral position if TTE
is not contributory. Reoperation is recommended if the paravalvular
leak is related to endocarditis or causes haemolysis requiring
repeated blood transfusions or leading to severe symptoms.
Transcatheter closure of a paravalvular leak is feasible, but experience is limited and there is presently no conclusive evidence to show
consistent efficacy. [539] Transcatheter closure of paravalvular leaks
should be considered for anatomically suitable paravalvular leaks in
candidates selected by the Heart Team. [540] Medical therapy (including

iron supplementation, beta-blockers, and erythropoietin) is indicated
in patients with severe haemolytic anaemia when contraindications
to surgical or transcatheter closure are present. [540]


BHVs have also been reported after surgery or transcatheter valve
implantation. [541] Thrombus on BHVs can present as hypo-attenuated
leaflet thickening (HALT) with relatively normal leaflet motion, HALT
with reduced leaflet motion but normal gradients, and clinical valve
thrombosis with elevated gradients. Distinguishing between thrombus
and pannus by means of CCT is important to guide decision making.

11.4.4.2 Valve thrombosis

The management of MHVs thrombosis is high risk, whatever the option
taken. Fibrinolysis carries risks of bleeding, systemic embolism, and
recurrent thrombosis. [542] Emergency valve replacement is recommended for obstructive prosthetic valve thrombosis in critically ill
patients without a contraindication to surgery. Management of nonobstructive thrombosis of an MHV depends mainly on the occurrence
of a thromboembolic event and the size of the thrombus. Surgery
should be considered for a large (>10 mm) non-obstructive prosthetic
valve thrombus that is complicated by embolism or persists despite
optimal anticoagulation. [543] Fibrinolysis may be considered if surgery is
not an option or is very high risk for the treatment of thrombosis of
right-sided prostheses, but carries a risk of bleeding and thromboembolism. Anticoagulation using a VKA and/or UFH is the first-line treatment

of BHV thrombosis. Because BHV thrombosis is associated with recur
rence and early prosthetic degeneration, indefinite anticoagulation
should be considered after a confirmed episode, but this strategy must
be balanced against an increased risk of bleeding [544][,][545] (Figure 10).

11.4.4.3 Subclinical leaflet thrombosis
HALT is detected by CCT in 12.4% and 32.4% of TAVI patients on
OAC or DAPT at 3 months, respectively. [546] The clinical significance
of these findings is uncertain. Selective use of oral anticoagulants in
patients with confirmed HALT and restricted leaflet motion with elevated gradients should be considered.

11.4.5 Heart failure

Heart failure after valve surgery should lead to a quick search for
SVD or PPM, deterioration of repair, LV dysfunction, or progression

of another valve disease. Non-valvular-related causes such as CAD,

hypertension, or sustained arrhythmias should also be considered.
The management of patients with heart failure should follow the relevant guidelines and consensus documents. [142][,][247]

11.4.4 Thrombosis

11.4.4.1 General comments

Obstructive valve thrombosis should be suspected promptly in any
patient with any type of prosthetic valve who presents with recent dyspnoea or an embolic event. The diagnosis should be confirmed by TTE
and TOE, cinefluoroscopy, or CCT if promptly available. [268][,][314] Valve
thrombosis occurs mainly in MHVs. However, cases of thrombosis of

12.1 Preoperative evaluation
Patient and surgical specific factors dictate the strategy. [489][,][548][,][549] The
cardiologist provides recommendations on pre- and perioperative
management, surveillance, and continuation of chronic cardiovascular
medical treatment. Echocardiography should be performed in any
patient with VHD requiring NCS. Determination of functional
capacity is a pivotal step in preoperative risk assessment, measured
either by ability to perform activities in daily life or by exercise test.
The decision for management should be taken after multidisciplinary
discussion involving cardiologists, surgeons, and cardiac anaesthesiologists, as well as the team who will be in charge of NCS.

Patients receiving anticoagulation treatment should be managed as

discussed in section 11.

12.2 Specific valve lesions

12.2.1 Aortic stenosis

In patients with severe aortic stenosis, urgent NCS should be performed under careful haemodynamic monitoring. In case of high risk
of NCS, balloon valvuloplasty may be considered before NCS. [549]

Management related to elective NCS depends on the presence of
symptoms and the type of surgery. [489][,][549][�][553] In symptomatic
patients, aortic valve procedure should be considered before NCS.
The type of procedure, TAVI or SAVR, is decided by the Heart
Team. In asymptomatic patients, elective NCS, if at low to moderate
risk, can be performed safely, albeit with a risk of worsening heart failure. [489][,][552][,][553] If NCS implies large volume shifts, aortic valve procedure (TAVI or SAVR) should be considered first according to the
Heart Team’s decision (Figure 11).

12.2.2 Mitral stenosis

NCS can be performed safely in patients with non-significant mitral
stenosis (valve area >1.5 cm [2] ) and in asymptomatic patients with significant mitral stenosis and an SPAP <50 mmHg. In symptomatic
patients or in patients with SPAP >50 mmHg, correction of mitral
stenosis, by means of PMC whenever possible, should be attempted
before NCS if it is high risk.

12.2.3 Aortic and mitral regurgitation
NCS can be performed safely in asymptomatic patients with severe
mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation and preserved LV function. The presence of symptoms or LV dysfunction should lead to
consideration of valvular surgery, but this is seldom needed before
NCS. If LV dysfunction is severe (ejection fraction <30%) and/or
SPAP is >50/60 mmHg, NCS should be performed only if strictly necessary and after optimization of medical therapy for heart failure.

12.3 Perioperative monitoring
Heart rate control (particularly in mitral stenosis) and careful fluid
management (particularly in aortic stenosis) are needed. TOE monitoring may be considered.

### 12 Management during non- cardiac surgery

Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with
VHD who undergo NCS. Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis or
mitral stenosis may require valve replacement or percutaneous intervention before NCS. A detailed description of recommendations in
the setting is available in specific ESC Guidelines. [489]


. [............................................................................................................................................................................]

management before and during pregnancy should be taken after multidisciplinary discussion in the pregnancy Heart Team involving cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, obstetricians, neonatologists, and
anaesthesiologists.

13.1 Management before pregnancy
Valve disease should be evaluated before pregnancy and treated if
necessary. [554][,][555]

Pregnancy should be discouraged, and intervention should be recommended before pregnancy in the following cases:

 - [Patients with mitral stenosis and a valve area <1.5 cm] [2] [ (especially]
if <1.0 cm [2] ). [554][,][556]

 - [All symptomatic patients with severe AS or asymptomatic]

patients with impaired LV function (LVEF <50%) or an abnormal
exercise test should be counselled against pregnancy, and surgery
should be performed pre-pregnancy. [554][,][557]

 - [Women with Marfan syndrome and an aortic diameter >45 mm]

should be strongly discouraged from becoming pregnant without
prior aortic repair because of the high risk of aortic dissection.
Although an aortic diameter <40 mm is rarely associated with
aortic dissection, a completely safe diameter does not exist. With
an aortic diameter between 40 and 45 mm, previous aortic growth

without aortic repair. [558] Although the actual risk of dissection is
not well documented in the setting of bicuspid valves, counselling
against pregnancy is recommended in the setting of aortic diameters >50 mm (>27 mm [2] BSA). [559] Finally, an aortic diameter
>25 mm/m [2] BSA in Turner syndrome and all patients with vascular
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are also contraindications for pregnancy.

In women considering pregnancy and requiring heart valve
replacement, it is recommended to choose the prosthesis in consultation with a pregnancy Heart Team. [554][,][560]

Pregnancy in women with a mechanical valve, especially in the
mitral position, is associated with a high risk of maternal and foetal
complications, [554][,][561] which should be carefully discussed with the
patient and family.

13.2 Management during pregnancy

13.2.1 Patients with native valve disease
Moderate or severe mitral stenosis with a valve area <1.5 cm [2] in

pregnant women is usually poorly tolerated. PMC should be considered in severely symptomatic patients [New York Heart Association

�
(NYHA) class III IV] and/or those with SPAP >50 mmHg despite
optimal therapy. PMC should preferably be performed after the 20th
week of pregnancy in experienced centres. [554]


13.1 Management before pregnancy
Valve disease should be evaluated before pregnancy and treated if
necessary. [554][,][555]

Pregnancy should be discouraged, and intervention should be recommended before pregnancy in the following cases:



- [Patients with mitral stenosis and a valve area <1.5 cm] [2] [ (especially]
if <1.0 cm [2] ). [554][,][556]

- [All symptomatic patients with severe AS or asymptomatic]

patients with impaired LV function (LVEF <50%) or an abnormal
exercise test should be counselled against pregnancy, and surgery
should be performed pre-pregnancy. [554][,][557]

- [Women with Marfan syndrome and an aortic diameter >45 mm]

should be strongly discouraged from becoming pregnant without
prior aortic repair because of the high risk of aortic dissection.
Although an aortic diameter <40 mm is rarely associated with
aortic dissection, a completely safe diameter does not exist. With
an aortic diameter between 40 and 45 mm, previous aortic growth
and family history are important for advising pregnancy with or

ESC/EACTS Guidelines **609**


In patients who are severely symptomatic despite medical therapy,
BAV for severe aortic stenosis can be undertaken by an experienced
operator. [557] TAVI is a promising alternative, but experience during
pregnancy is very limited. [554]

Surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with a foetal
mortality rate of 15�56% [562] and should be restricted to the rare

conditions that threaten the mother’s life if transcatheter interven
tion is not possible or has failed. Valve replacement should be considered after early delivery by caesarean section.

Caesarean section is recommended for patients with severe mitral
or aortic stenosis, ascending aortic diameter >45 mm, severe pulmonary hypertension, or if delivery starts while treated with a VKA or

<2 weeks after discontinuation of a VKA.

13.2.2 Mechanical prosthesis
It is recommended to manage pregnancy in patients with MHV in a
centre with a pregnancy Heart Team. [554]

Therapeutic anticoagulation during pregnancy is of utmost importance to avoid complications in these patients, keeping in mind that
no anticoagulation regimen is ideal and management will require a

careful balance between maternal and foetal risks.

In patients requiring <5 mg/day warfarin, oral anticoagulants
throughout pregnancy and a change to UFH before delivery is favoured. In patients requiring higher doses, switching to LMWH during
the first trimester with strict anti-Xa monitoring (therapeutic range
0.8�1.2 IU/mL, aortic valve prosthesis; and 1.0�1.2 IU/mL, mitral
and right sided valve prosthesis) and the use of oral anticoagulants
afterwards is favoured with a change to UFH before delivery. [554]
### 14 Key messages

General comments

1. Precise evaluation of the patient’s history and symptomatic status, as well as proper physical examination, are crucial for the diagnosis and management of VHD.
2. Echocardiography is the key technique to diagnose VHD and
assess its severity and prognosis. Other non-invasive investigations
such as CMR, CCT, fluoroscopy, and biomarkers provide important
additional information in selected patients. Stress testing should be
widely used in asymptomatic patients. Invasive investigation, beyond
preoperative coronary angiography, is restricted to situations where

non-invasive evaluation is inconclusive.

3. Decision making in elderly patients requires the integration of
multiple parameters, including estimation of life expectancy and
anticipated quality of life, evaluation of comorbidities, and general
condition (including frailty).
4. Decision making in asymptomatic patients weighs the risk of
intervention against the expected natural history of VHD. Stress testing should be liberally performed.
5. Informed patient’s expectations and values are an important
part of the decision-making process.
6. Interventions (surgery or transcatheter) are indicated in symptomatic patients (spontaneous or exercise induced) in the absence of
futility. In selected asymptomatic patients, presence of predictors of
rapid symptom progression justifies early intervention when procedural risk is low. . [............................................................................................................................................................................]


7. Heart Valve Centres with multidisciplinary Heart Teams, Heart
Valve Clinics, comprehensive equipment, and sufficient volumes of
procedures are required to deliver high-quality care and provide
adequate training.
8. Careful follow-up of symptomatic status, LV/RV size, and function is mandatory in asymptomatic patients with severe VHD if an
intervention is not yet indicated.
9. In patients with AF, NOACs are contraindicated in patients with
clinically significant mitral stenosis or mechanical valves. For stroke
prevention in patients who are eligible for OAC, NOACs are recommended in preference to VKAs in patients with aortic stenosis, aortic
and mitral regurgitation, or aortic bioprostheses >3 months after
implantation.

Aortic regurgitation
10. The evaluation of aortic regurgitation requires careful assessment of potentially associated aortic dilatation to guide the timing
and type of surgery.

Aortic stenosis

11. Diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis requires integrative evaluation of pressure gradients (the most robust measurements), AVA,

extent of valve calcification, flow conditions, and LV function.

12. Selection of the most appropriate mode of intervention by the
Heart Team should take into account clinical characteristics (age and
estimated life expectancy, general condition), anatomical characteristics, the relative risks of SAVR and TAVI, the feasibility of transfemoral TAVI, local experience and outcome data, as well as informed
patient preference.

Mitral regurgitation
13. Regarding imaging, routine quantification of EROA is an important part of the integrative evaluation for quantification and risk
stratification in patients with PMR. 3D transoesophageal echocardiography is more accurate than 2D echocardiography for defining
the underlying mechanism of PMR. CMR is useful when echocardiographic evaluation of severe PMR grade is inconclusive.
14. Surgical mitral valve repair is the preferred method of treatment in PMR if a durable repair can be achieved. TEER is a safe but
less efficacious alternative that may be considered in patients with
contraindications for surgery or high operative risk.
15. In patients with severe SMR, GDMT (including CRT if indicated)
should be the first step. If the patient remains symptomatic: mitral surgery is recommended concomitantly in patients with an indication for
CABG or other cardiac surgery. Isolated valve surgery may be considered in selected patients. TEER should be considered in patients not
eligible for surgery and fulfilling criteria indicating an increased chance
of responding to the treatment. Circulatory support devices, cardiac
transplantation, or palliative care should be considered as an alternative in patients with end-stage LV and/or RV failure.

Mitral stenosis

16. PMC is currently the standard of care in patients with severe
rheumatic mitral stenosis and favourable valve anatomy.
17. Decision making as to the type of intervention used in
patients with unfavourable anatomy is still a matter of debate and
must take into account the multifactorial nature of predicting the

results of PMC.

**610** ESC/EACTS Guidelines


Tricuspid regurgitation
18. Relevant tricuspid regurgitation requires early intervention to
avoid secondary damage of the RV.
19. Tricuspid regurgitation should be liberally treated at the time
of left-sided valve surgery. Isolated surgery of severe secondary tricuspid regurgitation (with or without previous left-sided valve surgery) requires comprehensive assessment of the underlying disease,
pulmonary haemodynamics, and RV function.

Prosthetic valves

20. The choice between a mechanical prosthesis and a bioprosthesis
should be patient-centred and multifactorial based on patient characteristics, the indication for lifelong anticoagulation, the potential and
risks of a re-intervention, and the informed patient preference.
21. Clinical assessment of prosthetic valves should be performed
yearly and as soon as possible if new cardiac symptoms occur.
